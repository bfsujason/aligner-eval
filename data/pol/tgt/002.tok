november 17 , 2012
the political report to the 18th national congress of the cpc have chart a grand blueprint for bring about a moderately prosperous society in all respects , accelerate socialist modernization , and achieve new victory for socialism with chinese characteristic in the new historic circumstance .
it be a political proclamation and action plan with which we party will rally and lead the chinese people of all ethnic group in march along the path of chinese socialism and complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects .
it guide the work of the current central leadership .
the cpc central committee have issue a notice on conscientiously study , disseminate and implement the guide principle of the 18th national congress , and party committee at all level should strictly comply with the notice .
it be emphasize at the 18th national congress that we should uphold socialism with chinese characteristic , that the socialist system with chinese characteristic be the fundamental accomplishment make by the party and the people during the arduous struggle over the past 90 year , and that we must cherish what have be accomplish and never deviate from it but rather continue to enrich it .
the congress have call on the whole party to explore and master the law of socialism with chinese characteristic , ensure that the party be always full of vigor and that china never lack the drive force for development , and that we must strive for a bright future for develop china ’s socialism .
in fact , adhering to and develop socialism with chinese characteristic be the theme of the political report to the 18th national congress .
we must always stick to this theme , continue to develop socialism with chinese characteristic , and work hard to reach the goal .
this will enable we to study , understand and implement the guide principle of the 18th national congress more thoroughly , completely and conscientiously .
why have i emphasize this ?
because only socialism can save china , and only chinese socialism can lead we country to development – a fact that have be fully prove through the long-term practice of the party and the state .
only by uphold socialism with chinese characteristic can we bring together and lead the whole party , the whole nation and the people of all ethnic group in realize a moderately prosperous society by the centenary of the cpc in 2021 and in turn china into a prosperous , democratic , culturally advanced and harmonious modern socialist country by the centenary of the people ’s republic of china in 2049 , so as to ensure the people greater happiness and the nation a brighter future .
to study , disseminate and implement the guide principle of the 18th national congress with emphasis on adhering to and develop socialism with chinese characteristic , in my opinion , it be important to pay particular attention to the follow area when apply theory to practice :
first , we must understand that socialism with chinese characteristic be a fundamental accomplishment make by the party and the people during long-term practice .
china ’s socialist system be pioneer in the new era of reform and open up , and it be a outcome of the party ’s painstaking effort .
it be accomplish by the whole party and whole people , under several generation of the party ’s central collective leadership , through numerous trial and tenacious effort at all cost .
rely closely on the people , we party lower the curtain , once and for all , on a poor and weak country that have suffer from both domestic turmoil and foreign aggression since the advent of modern time , and make a epic move towards the steady growth , development and renewal of the chinese nation .
it have thus enable china , a country with a civilization of over 5,000 year , to stand firm among the nation of the world .
we must always remember the historic contribution make by the party ’s three generation of central collective leadership and the party central committee with comrade hu jintao as general secretary to the development of socialism with chinese characteristic .
the first generation of the central collective leadership with mao zedong at the core provide invaluable experience as well as the theoretical and material basis for the great initiative of building socialism with chinese characteristic in the new historic period .
the second generation with deng xiaoping at the core start the building of socialism with chinese characteristic .
the third generation with jiang zemin at the core advance socialism with chinese characteristic into the 21st century , follow by hu jintao as general secretary of the central committee who adhere to and develop socialism with chinese characteristic from a new historic start point .
it go without say that socialism with chinese characteristic encapsulate the ideal and exploration of generation of chinese communists , embody the aspiration of countless patriot and revolutionary martyr , and crystallize the struggle and sacrifice of the myriad of the chinese people .
it be a natural choice for the development of chinese society in modern time , and it be the only way to bring about the courtry ’s development and stability .
fact prove that chinese socialism be a banner of unity , endeavor and victory for the cpc and the chinese people as a whole .
we must always uphold socialism with chinese characteristic and firmly adhere to and develop chinese socialism in order to bring about a moderately prosperous society in all respects , accelerate socialist modernization and achieve the great renewal of the chinese nation .
this be the very reason why the 18th national congress have call on the whole party to have full confidence in the path , theory and system of chinese socialism .
second , we must thoroughly understand that socialism with chinese characteristic consist of a path , theory and system .
the 18th national congress expound on the scientific meaning of the path , theory and system of socialism with chinese characteristic , and the relationship between the three .
the congress stress that the path of socialism with chinese characteristic be a way to reach the goal , the theory offer a guide to action , and the system provide a fundamental guarantee .
all three serve the great cause of building chinese socialism .
this be the most salient feature of socialism with chinese characteristic .
this conclusion reveal that socialism with chinese characteristic incorporate practice , theory and system .
it synthesize successful experience in practice into theory , use these correct theory to guide new practice and incorporate effective principle and policy into party and national system .
that be why socialism with chinese characteristic be special – in its path , theory and system ; in the intrinsic interaction between the way of realize the goal , guide to action and fundamental guarantee ; and in that all three serve the great practice of building chinese socialism .
in present-day china , adhering to and develop socialism with chinese characteristic mean uphold socialism in its true sense .
the path of chinese socialism be the only way to achieve china ’s socialist modernization and create a better life .
this path take economic development as the central task , and bring along economic , political , cultural , social , ecological and other form of progress .
it adhere to both the four cardinal principle and the reform and opening-up policy .
it entail further release and develop the productive force , and achieve prosperity for all and the well-rounded development of everyone .
the theory of socialism with chinese characteristic be the latest achievement in adapt marxism to china ’s condition .
it incorporate deng xiaoping theory , the important thought of the three represent and the scientific outlook on development .
it have inherit , continue and creatively develop marxism-leninism and mao zedong thought .
we should not abandon marxism-leninism and mao zedong thought ; otherwise , we would be deprive of we foundation .
moreover , we must focus we work on the practical problem in reform , open up and modernization , and on we various endeavor , with a view to the application of marxist theory , theoretical thinking on practical issue , and initiation of new practice for development .
in contemporary china uphold the theory of socialism with chinese characteristic mean uphold marxism in its true sense .
the socialist system with chinese characteristic integrate the fundamental political system , the basic political system , the basic economic system and other system and mechanism .
it combine national and local democratic system , the party ’s leadership , the position of the people as master of the country , and law-based governance .
this system conform to the national condition in china , showcase the special trait and strength of socialism with chinese characteristic , and provide a fundamental systemic guarantee for china ’s development .
the socialist system with chinese characteristic be unique and effective .
however , we should be aware that it be not perfect or fully function .
the chinese socialist system need to improve to keep in step with the development of the socialist cause with chinese characteristic .
during he inspection tour of southern china in 1992 deng xiaoping point out , “ it will probably take another thirty year for we to develop a more mature and well-defined system in every field . ”
it be emphasize at the 18th national congress that it be imperative to give top priority to the building of system while give full play to the superiority of the socialist political system in china .
we must improve current system and promote institutional innovation with theoretical innovation base on practice .
we must proceed from reality , formulate new system in a timely fashion , and put in place a well-developed , systematically and rationally regulate , and effective framework of system to ensure that all system and institution be work properly and function well , and thereby provide a more effective institutional guarantee for new victory .
third , we must have a in-depth understanding of the basic foundation , overall planning and main mandate of building socialism with chinese characteristic .
it be emphasize at the 18th national congress that the basic foundation for build socialism with chinese characteristic be that china be in the primary stage of socialism , that its overall plan be to seek economic , political , cultural , social , and ecological progress , and that its main objective be to achieve socialist modernization and rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
the foundation , plan and objective be succinctly and pointedly define .
a better understanding and grasp of these new definition will help we get to the essence and essential of socialism with chinese characteristic .
it be important to stress the basic foundation of china be in the primary stage of socialism .
this be the paramount reality and the most important national condition in contemporary china .
we must always bear it in mind and promote reform and development in all respects on the basis of this very reality .
it be imperative not only in accelerate the economy , but also in speed up political , cultural , social and ecological development ; not only when we economy be small , but also when it be large ; and not only when plan long-term development , but also during daily work .
the party ’s basic line for the primary stage of socialism be the lifeline of the party and the state .
in practice we must firmly adhere to “ one central task , two basic point , ” neither deviate from the “ one central task ” nor neglect the “ two basic point . ”
we must adopt a holistic approach to the realization of the common ideal of building chinese socialism and the long-term goal of realize communism , stand firm against various erroneous view aim at abandon socialism , and rectify all erroneous and unrealistic mindset , policy and measure that go beyond the current primary stage of socialism .
this will keep we from be either self-abased or over-confident , and enable we to achieve new victory for china ’s socialism .
we give top priority to overall planning , simply because we must achieve all-round development of socialism with chinese characteristic .
the most important thing for we party be to govern the country well and rejuvenate the nation .
the party must always represent the requirement for develop the advanced productive force .
we must focus on economic development and promote coordinate political , cultural , social and ecological development on the basis of economic growth .
as china step forward socially and economically , it have become increasingly significant to pursue ecological progress .
the 18th national congress include ecological progress in its overall plan for build chinese socialism , thus highlight the strategic importance of ecological progress and make it possible to incorporate ecological effort into those for economic , political , cultural and social progress in all respects and throughout the whole process .
this be a important practical and theoretical achievement of we party in we understanding of the law of building socialism .
we must carry out the overall plan , pursue coordinate development in all area of we modernization drive , and promote harmony between the relationship of production and the productive force , and between the superstructure and the economic base .
we pay close attention to the main objective because the cpc have shoulder the historic mission of rejuvenate the chinese nation ever since its birth .
the very purpose of the party in lead the chinese people in revolution , development and reform be to make the people prosperous and the country strong , and rejuvenate the chinese nation .
accord to the three-step strategic plan for modernization , it be the goal of we party and state to build a prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced and harmonious modern socialist country during the primary stage of socialism .
the historic mission of we party , the fundamental purpose of reform and open up , and the goal of we country all converge in the main objective and be also derive from it .
this be a objective for which we should never relax we effort , nor should we future generation .
during different historical period we party have always be able to put forth inspirational goal in line with the will of the people and the need of we development , and lead the people in achieve those goal .
in response to both domestic and international change and new economic and social development in china , and live up to the new expectation of the people , the 18th national congress revise the goal of build a moderately prosperous society in all respects , with a clearer policy guidance , greater inclination towards development problem , and better response to the people ’s expectation .

these requirement be base on six decade of we experience in building socialism , especially socialism with chinese characteristic , and on the party ’s basic theory , line , platform and experience .

the cpc be the core leadership for the cause of chinese socialism – this be why we must enhance and improve the party ’s leadership and give full play to its lead and core role in exercise overall leadership and coordinate the effort of all .
the basic requirement set forth at the 18th national congress positively respond to the need of address press issue in china ’s economic and social development , the challenge in the difficult in-depth reform and in speed up the transformation of the growth model , and the sensitive issue that official and the general public be especially concern about .

these basic requirement cover many area – the productive force and relation of production , the economic base and the superstructure , the great cause of chinese socialism and the new undertaking of party building , and a holistic approach to both the domestic and international situation .
the 18th national congress stick close to and fully reflect these basic requirement in make plan and arrangement for action in various area .
if we truly meet all the basic requirement we will be able to pool we strength more effectively , overcome all difficulty , pursue balanced , proper and coordinate development , promote social harmony and improve we people ’s life .
then we can complete the glorious and arduous task bestow by the time .
fifth , we must fully understand why we need to ensure that the cpc be always the firm core leadership guide the cause of chinese socialism .
it be emphasize at the 18th national congress that the cpc shoulder the great responsibility for bring together and lead the people in build a moderately prosperous society in all respects , in advance socialist modernization and in achieve the great renewal of the chinese nation .
the party ’s strength and its close tie with the people have ensure china prosperity and stability , and the chinese people peace and happiness .
the new development , the need for progress in we cause and the people ’s expectation have all make it imperative for we to carry out the great new undertaking of party building in the spirit of reform and innovation , and upgrade we effort in all respects to a new level .
to run the country well we must first run the party well , and to run the party well we must run it strictly .
for this purpose , the 18th national congress set forth the overall requirement for systematic party building in the new circumstance , and spell out the specific task involve .
the whole party must learn and understand they , and implement they to the letter .
the overall requirement for party building set forth at the 18th national congress be derive from the need to inherit and develop the fundamental that have shore up the advanced nature of we party , a marxist party , for over 90 year .
they respond to change in the world , in we country and within we party .
over the year we have be press ahead with the new task of party building in all respects .
the party have enhance its govern capability , preserved and improve its pioneering nature and purity , and strengthen and improve its leadership .
however , in view of the need to manage change in domestic and international condition , and to accomplish its historic mission , there be still considerable room for we party to improve its art of leadership , govern capacity and organization , and the quality , competence , and practice of its member and official .
party building in the new circumstance , in particular , face “ four test ” and “ four risk , ” which make it more difficult and press to ensure that the party properly manage its own affair and strictly discipline itself .
all party member must heighten they sense of urgency and responsibility , focus on the overall requirement of party building , steadily improve the party ’s art of leadership and governance , and enhance its ability to resist corruption , prevent degeneration and ward off corruption risk , so that we party may always remain ahead of the time in its historic journey accompany by profound change worldwide , always act as the backbone of the chinese people in its historic response to domestic and international risk and test of all kind , and always be the strong core leadership in the historic journey to adhere to and develop chinese socialism .
it have always be the foundation for the lifeline and pursuit of all communists to have full confidence in ideal and firm faith in communism .
belief in marxism and faith in socialism and communism be the political soul of communists , enable they to withstand all test .
put figuratively , the ideal and conviction of communists be the marrow of they faith .
without , or with weak , ideal or conviction , they would be deprive of they marrow and suffer from “ lack of backbone . ”
this have be prove true by the case of some party member and official who act improperly due to lack of ideal and confused faith .
all party member , in accordance with the plan set at the 18th national congress , must earnestly study and implement the system of socialist theory with chinese characteristic , especially the scientific outlook on development , reflect party awareness in they action , observe moral standard , set good example and work hard for the common goal of realize chinese socialism .
maintain close tie between the party and the people and between official and individual have always be the basis of we success .
fact prove that the future and destiny of a political party and government depend on popular support .
if we stray from the people and lose they support we will end up in failure .
we must bear in mind the new characteristic and requirement for public work in the new circumstance .
we must organize we people , communicate with they , educate they , serve they , learn from they , and subject ourselves to they oversight .
we should always be part of the people , work for they interest , and maintain close tie and share good and bad time with they .
we should draw wisdom and strength from they great practice ; deliver more concrete service to the people that meet they need , relieve they burden and benefit they life ; and put a stop to all act that prejudice they interest .
the 18th national congress propose the idea of carry out a extensive program throughout the party to heighten awareness of and implement the party ’s mass line , with the focus on serve the people and stay pragmatic and honest .
the cpc central committee will make specific arrangement for this program , and party committee at all level should implement they , solve press problem of major concern to the people and make the program a success .
it have always be the cpc ’s consistent and clear political position to combat corruption , promote political integrity and keep the party healthy .
build a fine party culture and a corruption-free party be a major political issue of great concern to the people .
“ worm can only grow in something rotten . ”
in recent year , long-pent-up problem in some country have lead to resentment among the people , unrest in society and the downfall of government , with corruption be a major culprit .
fact prove that if corruption be allow to spread , it will eventually lead to the destruction of a party and the fall of a government .
we must keep up we vigilance .
serious violation of party discipline and state law that have occur inside we party during the past few year be of a vile nature and have produce shockingly harmful political consequence .
party committee at all level must firmly oppose and combat corruption , and prevent and crack down on it more effectively to ensure that all official be honest and upright , government clean and incorruptible , and communists of political integrity .
official at all level , especially high-ranking official , must conscientiously observe the code of conduct .
they should exercise strict self-discipline , strengthen education and restrain they own family and staff .
it be absolutely impermissible to abuse one ’s power for personal gain or to seek privilege .
all violation of party discipline and state law must be punish without exception , and we shall not be soft in deal with they .
the 18th national congress point out that develop chinese socialism be a long-term arduous task of historic importance , and that we must be prepare for a great struggle with many new historic feature .
all party member must make strenuous effort with firm conviction and unswervingly develop socialism with chinese characteristic in a pioneering spirit .

these be mission of historic importance that have be bestow on we generation of communists , and to which we must dedicate all we wisdom and strength .
uphold and develop socialism with chinese characteristic
january 5 , 2013
which path should we follow ?
this be the paramount question for the future of the party and the success of its cause .
socialism with chinese characteristic be the integration of the theory of scientific socialism and social development theory of chinese history .
socialism have take root in china .
it reflect the wish of the people and meet the development need of the country and the time .
it be a sure route to success in build a moderately prosperous society in all respects , in the acceleration of socialist modernization , and in the great renewal of the chinese nation .
all party member must follow the guidance of deng xiaoping theory , the important thought of the three represent and the scientific outlook on development , be firm in they commitment to socialism with chinese characteristic and to the marxist view on development , treat practice as the sole criterion for testing truth , and apply they historic initiative and creativity .
we must be clearly aware what be change and what remain constant in the international , national and party situation .
never should we hesitate to blaze new trail , bridge river , forge ahead with determination , and audaciously explore new territory .
we should have the courage and capability to address press issue in we work and remove doubt in people ’s mind , and come up with solution .
we should drive reform and open up to a deeper level , make new discovery , create new idea , achieve new progress , and promote innovation in we theory , practice and system .
the guide principle of the party ’s 18th national congress , in essence , boil down to uphold and develop socialism with chinese characteristic .
the year 2013 be the 31st year since deng xiaoping put forward the concept of building socialism with chinese characteristic .
he provide for the first time clear systematic answer to several basic question about how to build , consolidate and develop socialism in china , a economically and culturally underdeveloped country .
he answer bring a new perspective to marxism , open up new realm , and raise the understanding of socialism to a new scientific level .
socialism with chinese characteristic be socialism and nothing else .
the basic principle of scientific socialism must not be abandon ; otherwise it be not socialism .
what doctrine a country may choose be base on whether it can resolve the historical problem that confront that country .
both history and reality have show we that only socialism can save china and only socialism with chinese characteristic can bring development to china .
this conclusion be the result of historical exploration , and the choice of the people .
as socialism progress , we institution will undoubtedly mature , the strength of we system will become self-evident , and we development path will assuredly become wider .
we must have confidence in we path , we theory and we system .
we must be as tenacious as bamboo , as describe by zheng xie : “ in the face of all blow , not bend low , it still stand fast .
whether from east , west , south or north the wind doth blast . ”
the process by which the people build socialism under the leadership of the party can be divide into two historical phase – one that precede the launch of reform and open up in 1978 , and a second that follow on from that event .
the two phase – at once relate to and distinct from each other – be both pragmatic exploration in building socialism conduct by the people under the leadership of the party .
chinese socialism be initiate after the launch of reform and open up and base on more than 20 year of development since the socialist system be establish in the 1950s after the people ’s republic of china ( prc ) be found .
although the two historical phase be very different in they guide thought , principle , policy , and practical work , they be by no means separate from or oppose to each other .
we should neither negate the pre-reform-and-opening-up phase in comparison with the post-reform-and-opening-up phase , nor the converse .
we should adhere to the principle of seek truth from fact and distinguish the trunk from the branch .
we should uphold truth , rectify we error , draw on practical experience , and learn lesson .
this be the foundation which facilitate further advance of the cause of the party and the people .
marxism will not remain stagnant .
it will certainly keep up with the time , the progress of we practice and the advance of science .
socialism too always advance through practice .
developing chinese socialism be a great cause .
deng xiaoping clearly define some basic thought and principle on the subject .
the central committee head by jiang zemin , and later by hu jintao also add some outstanding chapter to it .
now , the job of the communists of we generation be to continue with this mission .
we must adhere to marxism and socialism from a developmental perspective .
with each step forward we will encounter new situation and unfamiliar problem , we will face greater risk and challenge , and we will be confront by the unexpected .
we must be prepare for adversity and danger , even in time of prosperity and peace .
we should not pretend to know what we do not know .
we should try to put what we already know to use , and lose no time in learn what we do not know .
we must not be muddle-headed .
party member , particularly party official , should maintain a firm belief in lofty communist ideal , along with the common ideal of building socialism with chinese characteristic , and pursue they with dedication .
we must be rigorous in implement the party ’s basic line and program in the primary stage of socialism , and do all we work well .
we revolutionary ideal be of the greatest importance .
a party member devoid of ideal lack a essential quality – as do one who engage in empty talk about lofty ideal without do anything .
there be objective criterion to measure whether party member or party official have these high communist ideal .
can they stick to the basic principle of serve the people heart and soul ?
can they be the first to bear hardship and the last to enjoy comfort ?
can they work hard and remain honest and dedicate ?
and can they make every possible effort and even lay they life on the line for the sake of they ideal ?
flaw thinking , hedonistic desire , corrupt behavior and passive attitude – all be at odds with the communist ideal .
carry on the enduring spirit of mao zedong thought
december 26 , 2013
the enduring spirit of mao zedong thought refer to the stand , viewpoint and method crystalize in the thought , which feature three basic tenet – seek truth from fact , the mass line and independence .
in the new condition , we should uphold and apply the enduring spirit of mao zedong thought in build we party and advance the great cause of socialism with chinese characteristic .
as a fundamental tenet of marxism , seek truth from fact be a basic requirement for chinese communists to understand and transform the world .
it be also we party ’s basic thinking , work and lead approach .
we have uphold and should continue to uphold the principle of proceed from reality in everything we do , integrate theory with practice , and testing and develop truth in practice .
mao zedong once say , “‘ fact ’ be all the thing that exist objectively , ‘ truth ’ mean they internal relation , that be , the law govern they , and ‘ to seek ’ means to study . ”
he also use the metaphor “ shoot the arrow at the target , ” that be , we should shoot the “ arrow ” of marxism at the “ target ” of china ’s revolution , modernization drive and reform .
to seek truth from fact , we must acquire a deep understanding of a matter as it be , see through the surface into the heart of the matter , and discover the intricate link between matter amidst fragmented phenomenon .
we should follow objective law on the basis that we recognize the existence of a matter and its development law .
uphold the principle of seek truth from fact be not do once and for all .
you may succeed by follow the principle at a certain place and at a certain time , but that do not mean that you may succeed again by follow the principle at another place and at another time .
the conclusion or experience draw at a certain place and at a certain time do not necessarily apply at another place and at another time .
we should conscientiously strengthen we conviction in seek truth from fact and enhance we ability to apply it .
we should always bear it in mind and implement it in we work .
as we stand now , seek truth from fact mean that we should clearly understand we basic national condition , that be , we country be still in the primary stage of socialism , and will remain so for a long time to come .
when advance reform and development , and formulate guideline and policy , we should do everything in line with this basic national condition .
any tendency to pursue quick success regardless of objective condition and timing should be avoid , and any outdated or complacent idea and action which do not conform to reality , or which neglect fundamental change of reality , should be correct without exception .
while seek truth from fact , we should always uphold the truth and correct mistake for the sake of the people ’s interest .
we should be frank , selfless and fearless , courageously speak out truth base on fact , discover and correct ideological deviation and mistake in decision-making and work as soon as they arise , and discover and solve all kind of conflict and problem when they come up so as to make we thought and act conform to objective law , the requirement of the time and the wish of the people .
in seek truth from fact , we should promote theoretical innovation base on practice .
the basic tenet of marxism be universal truth with eternal ideological value .
nevertheless , the classical marxist author do not exhaust truth but blaze a trail to seek and develop truth .
today , new problem will arise while we adhere to and develop socialism with chinese characteristic , drive reform to a deeper level , and deal effectively with foreseeable and unpredictable difficulty and risk on we way ahead .
all these thing be cry out for new and appropriate theoretical solution .
we should review the fresh experience gain by the people under the leadership of the party , constantly adapt marxism to chinese condition and make contemporary marxism shine brighter in china .
the mass line be the party ’s lifeline and fundamental work principle .
it be a cherish tradition that enable we party to maintain its vitality and combat capability .
we have always be and will always be obligate to do everything in the interest of the people and rely on they strength , and carry out the principle of “ from the people , to the people , ” translate the party ’s policy into the people ’s conscientious action and implement the mass line in all government activity .
the mass line in essence encapsulate the basic tenet of marxism that the people be the creator of history .
we must adhere to this principle in order to grasp the basic law govern the advance of history .
we must observe these law so that we can be invincible .
history have time and again prove that the people be the major force behind historical development and social progress .
as mao zedong say , “ once china ’s destiny be in the hand of the people , china , like the sun rise in the east , will illuminate every corner of the land with a brilliant flame . ”
adhere to the mass line be recognize that the people be the fundamental force in decide we future and destiny .
the strong foundation keep the party invincible lie in we adhering to the people ’s principal position in the country , and bring they initiative into full play .
before the people , we be always student .
therefore we must seek advice from they .
we must fully respect they wish , experience , rights and role .
we should cherish the power confer on we by the people and exercise it discreetly , and welcome they supervision .
we should rely closely on they to create historic achievement , so as to make the foundation of we party rock-solid .
adhere to the mass line mean follow the fundamental tenet of serve the people wholeheartedly .
“ decree may be follow if they be in accordance with the aspiration of the people ; they may be ineffective if they be against the aspiration of the people . ”
serve the people wholeheartedly be the fundamental purpose and outcome of all the work of the party , and a symbol that distinguish we party from all other party .
the supreme criterion for all party action be that it serve the interest of the great majority of the people .
the effectiveness of all we work should ultimately be measure by the real benefit the people have reap , by the improvement in they life and by how well they rights and interest be protect .
they expectation for a better life do not allow we to be complacent or slack , but require we to work harder to enable everyone to share more fruit of development in a fairer way and move steadily towards common prosperity .
adhere to the mass line mean maintain close tie between the party and the people .
the supreme political advantage of we party be its close tie with the people , and the biggest danger for a rule party be for it to become divorce from the people .
mao zedong say , “ we communists be like seed , and the people be like the soil .
wherever we go , we must unite with the people , take root and blossom among they . ”
all party member should bear in mind the concept of people first and the mass line , and put they into practice .
we should do we utmost to solve problem within the party and especially those the people be particularly dissatisfy with , so that we party can always have they trust and support .
adhere to the mass line mean ask the people to judge we work .
“ it be the people who know whether a decree be good or not . ”
the future and destiny of any political party be determine by the popular support for it .
popular support be what we draw we strength from .
the number of party member be small compare to that of the people .
the grand goal of we party can never be realize without popular support .
it be not up to we to judge we party ’s governance capacity or performance ; they must and can only be judge by the people , the supreme and ultimate judge of the party ’s work .
if we be pretentious and divorce ourselves from the people or put ourselves above they , we will surely be abandon by they .
this be the case for any party , and be a iron law which admit of no exception .
independence be a inevitable conclusion draw by we party from china ’s reality , after go through the stage of revolution , development and reform by rely on the strength of the party and the people .
we should always rely on ourselves when seek we national development and defend we national pride and confidence , and resolutely follow we own road now and in the future as we do in the past .
independence be a fine tradition of the chinese nation and a essential principle for build the party and the prc .
the reality and the mission to carry out revolution and development in china , a eastern country with a large population and backward economy , have determine that we have no other choice but to follow we own path .
boast a vast land of 9.6 million sq km , a rich cultural heritage and a strong bond among the 1.3 billion chinese people , we be resolve to go we own way .
we have a big stage to display we advantage on , a long and rich history to draw benefit from , and a powerful impetus to push we ahead .
we chinese people – every single one of we – should draw confidence from this .
adhere to independence mean that chinese affair must be deal with and decide by the chinese people themselves .
there be no such thing in the world as a development model that can be apply universally , nor be there any development path that remain carve in stone .
the diversity of historical condition determine the diversity of the development path choose by various country .
in the whole history of mankind , no nation or state have ever be able to rise to power and rejuvenate itself by rely solely on external force or blindly follow other ; do so inevitably lead to failure or subservience .
we party have always independently explore its own development path while lead revolution , development and reform .
this spirit of independent exploration and practice , and the confidence and determination to stick to its own road be the bedrock of all the theory and practice of we party , and the guarantee that we party and people will go from victory to victory .
adhere to independence mean that we will firmly take the socialist path with chinese characteristic .
we will not take the old path of a rigid closed-door policy , nor a erroneous path by abandon socialism .
we should enhance we political faith and we confidence in the path , theory and system of chinese socialism .
we should expand this path , enrich these theory and improve these system through comprehensive reform and in response to change condition and task .
we should modestly draw on the achievement of all other culture , but never forget we own origin .
we must not blindly copy the development model of other country nor accept they dictation .
adhere to independence require we to uphold we independent foreign policy of peace , and follow the path of peaceful development .
we should hold high the banner of peace , development , cooperation and benefit for all , maintain friendly relation with other country on the basis of the five principle of peaceful coexistence , conduct exchange and cooperation with other country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , staunchly safeguard world peace , and promote common development .
we should take we position and make we policy on issue on they own merit , uphold fairness and justice , respect the right of each people in decide its own development path independently , and never force we will upon other nor allow anyone to impose theirs upon we .
we stand for peaceful resolution to international dispute , oppose all form of hegemony and power politics , and never seek hegemonism nor engage in expansion .
we will resolutely defend we sovereignty , security and development interest .
no country should assume that we will trade away we core interest , nor will we accept anything that harm we sovereignty , security or development interest .

we can not accomplish we goal with one single effort , nor can we realize we dream overnight .
every accomplishment in the world be hard-won .
the more beautiful the future , the harder we must work for it .
hard work will overcome difficulty and make one ’s dream come true .
we should endeavor to foster throughout society the work ethic of be down-to-earth and diligent .
lead official at all level should foster the ethos of model worker .
they should pursue realistic policy , boost morale and handle thing in a pragmatic way .
they should not be pretentious or just pursue image-building accomplishment , and they should firmly oppose formalism , bureaucratism , hedonism and extravagance , which both government official and the public detest .

yea , let there be daily renovation . ”
life never favor those who follow the beaten track and be satisfy with the status quo , and it never wait for the unambitious and those who sit idle and enjoy the fruit of other ’ work .
instead , it provide more opportunity for those who have the ability and courage to innovate .
young people be the most dynamic and most creative group of we society , and should stand in the forefront of innovation and creation .

currently we be face important opportunity for development , but we be also face unprecedented difficulty and challenge .
the dream stretch out before we and the road lie at we foot .
those who overcome they weakness be powerful , and those who keep improve themselves come out victor .
if we be to achieve we development goal , young people must work long and hard without letup .
young people must bear in mind that “ empty talk harm the country , while hard work make it flourish ” and put this into practice .
you must work hard at you own post , start from trivial thing , and create you own splendid life with hard work , outstanding performance and remarkable achievement .

young people must have the courage and determination to start up business and do pioneering work , try to blaze new trail and start new endeavor in reform and open up , and constantly create new prospects for they career development .
fifth , young people must temper you character .
socialism with chinese characteristic be a form of socialism in which material and cultural progress go hand in hand .
it be difficult for a nation without inner strength to be self-reliant , and a cause that lack a cultural buttress can not be sustain for long .
young people be a social force that lead the social ethos .
the cultural attainment of a nation be represent mostly by the morality and mental outlook of the younger generation .

the theme of the chinese youth movement today be to strive to realize the chinese dream of the rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
the chinese communist youth league should carry out extensive educational and practical activity with the theme of “ my chinese dream ” for young chinese .
it should sow the seed of and ignite the dream of each youth so that more young people dare to dream and pursue they dream .
in this way all young people can increase they youthful energy to realize the chinese dream .
the league should lay a solid intellectual basis for all young chinese with the chinese dream , and educate and help they to establish a correct world view , outlook on life and sense of value , always love we country , we people and we nation , and firmly follow the party along the chinese path .
the league should inspire young people ’s sense of historical responsibility through the chinese dream , carry forward the fine tradition of “ the league take action upon the party ’s call , ” combine its work with party and government work , and organize and mobilize young people to support reform , promote development and maintain stability .
the league must actively offer service for young people in pursue they dream , effectively improve its practice , get close to young people at the primary level , address they concern and press need , represent and protect the common interest and need of the young people , and try to build a favorable environment for they growth and development .
role model from among the youngster be good example for young people to learn from ; they shoulder more social responsibility and public expectation , and play a strong exemplary and leading role among young people , and even in society as a whole .
i hope these role model will make persistent effort , be strict with themselves , be determine to go ahead , and set a good example to all young people with they personal development , moral pursuit and exemplary action .
a country prosper if its youth be thrive ; a country be strong if its youth be robust .
ever since its founding in 1921 the party have represent , draw over and rely on young chinese people .

official at all level must pay attention to young people ’s aspiration , help they to grow , support they to start they own business , become they bosom friend , and show enthusiasm for youth work .
everybody be young once in they life .
now be the time for you to make the most of you youth ; and the future be a time for you to look back on it .
the path of life be sometimes level , sometimes steep ; sometimes smooth , sometimes rough ; sometimes straight , sometimes crooked .
young people be face with a wide range of choice .
but what be important for you be to be guide by a correct world view , outlook on life and sense of value when you be make you choice .
the life experience of countless successful people suggest that young people who choose to endure hardship will be duly reward , and those who make contribution to society be the one who deserve respect .
tribulation , setback and test have prove to be good for young people in they later life .
you need to have strength of character to be undaunted when confront good or bad fortune , have a firm will to keep press forward in spite of repeat setback , remain optimistic in all circumstance , turn you failure into a drive force , and learn from you experience , so that you life be raise to a higher plane .
in short , the only way you can have fond memory of a well-spent , warm and lasting youth with no regret be to work enthusiastically and energetically , tenaciously overcome all obstacle , and make a contribution to the people while you be still young .

second , i hope you will study hard .
learning be a lasting theme for one to conduct oneself in life and society .
it be also a important basis for one to serve one ’s country and people .
a dream start with learning , and career with practice .
in the world today , knowledge and information be quickly update , and if one slacken even a little in study , one be likely to fall behind .
some say that the world be a circle for everyone , with the amount of knowledge as the radius .
he who have a bigger radius have a broader scope to act within .
i hope that you will orient yourselve to modernization , to the whole world and to the future , and aim to broaden you knowledge in advanced knowhow , technology and management expertise .
you should keep the perseverance and diligence in reading as related in story of confucius , sun jing and su qin , kuang heng , and che yin and sun kang .

try to accomplish something in china , one must set oneself firmly on the soil of the home country , keep in mind the expectation of the people , correctly identify the point where one ’s professional strength and the need of social development converge and where advanced knowledge and china ’s condition meet .
only in this way can innovation and creativity succeed and deliver real benefit .
fourth , i hope you will work for dynamic exchange with other country .
china can not develop without the rest of the world ; nor can the world as a whole prosper without china .
we must open still wider to the outside world , strengthen we connectivity and interaction with it , and enhance we understanding and friendship with other people .
grow up in china and live overseas extensively , you have be steep in inter-personal relationship and cross-cultural communication .
many foreigner have get to know china through you while many chinese have learn about the outside world also through you .
i hope you will make full use of you advantage to strengthen connection and exchange between china and other country , act as unofficial ambassador to promote people-to-people friendship , and explain china ’s culture , history and point of view in such a way that the people from other country can understand and identify with china , and be ready to give it greater appreciation and support .

its influence as a people ’s organization have thus become more extensive .
face a new situation and new task , the western returned scholars association and chinese overseas-educated scholars association must give full play to its advantage as a people ’s organization and unite front with prominent intellectual as its member , base in china while reach out overseas to turn itself into a talent pool in the service of the country , a think tank of good idea and proposal and a vital force in people-to-people diplomacy ; and strive to become a bridge between the party and the overseas student and scholar , a assistant in the work of the party and government towards they , and a warm home to rally overseas student and scholar closely around the party .
the association should care for the work , study and life of overseas chinese student and scholar , reflect they wish and view , protect they lawful rights and interest , and constantly enhance the association ’s appeal and cohesion .
“ exaltation of the virtuous be fundamental to governance . ”
party committee and government at all level must earnestly implement party and government policy concern student and scholar study abroad , and train more effectively and on a larger scale all kind of talented people badly need by we reform , open up and modernization .
when the environment be sound , talented people will gather , and we cause will thrive ; but when it be not , they will go they separate way , and we cause will fail .
we must improve we work mechanism , and enhance the awareness of service , strengthen education and guidance , build more platform of innovation , be good at finding , unite with and use talented people , and help bring forth people of high caliber by create a environment favorable for the student to return and serve china , and in general to realize they potential .

today , in retrospect , we have a better understanding of he remark .
this be why , as we be well aware , only socialism can save china , and only reform and open up can develop china , socialism and marxism .
in light of the historical lesson we have learn and the need of the current time , the party central committee have be repeatedly stress since its 18th national congress that reform and open up play the decisive role in determine the destiny of contemporary china .
it be also the key to realize the two centenary goals and the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
there be no bound to practice and development , to free the people ’s mind , or to the reform and opening-up effort .
we will reach a impasse if we stall or go into reverse on we path ; reform and open up be always ongoing and will never end .
face the new situation and new task , we must continue the reform comprehensively to strive for solution to the major problem challenge china ’s development , and work tirelessly to promote the improvement and progress of socialism with chinese characteristic .
as extensive and profound change be take place domestically and internationally , china ’s development face a series of prominent dilemma and challenge , and there be quite a number of problem and difficulty on its path of development :
unbalanced , uncoordinated and unsustainable development remain a big problem .
we be weak in scientific and technological innovation .
the industrial structure be unbalanced and the growth mode remain inefficient .
the development gap between urban and rural area and between region be still large , and so be income disparity .
social problem be markedly on the rise .
there be many problem affect the people ’s immediate interest in education , employment , social security , health care , housing , the ecological environment , food and drug safety , workplace safety , public security , law enforcement , administration of justice , etc. .
some people still lead hard life .
formalism , bureaucratism , hedonism and extravagance be serious problem .
some sector be prone to corruption and other type of misconduct , and the fight against corruption remain a serious challenge for we .
to solve these problem , the key lie in continue the reform .
in april this year , after deep thinking and research , and after solicit opinion extensively both inside and outside the party , the cpc central committee ’s political bureau decide that continue the reform comprehensively would be the central topic for discussion at the third plenary session of the 18th cpc central committee and that the session would come up with a decision .

as the cpc have fight its way through revolution , construction and reform , its sole aim have always be to solve the problem of china .
it be fair to say that exist problem force we to reform , and reform be go deeper while problem be tackle and solve .
in the past 35 year we have overcome many problem hinder the development of the party and the state through reform .
but new problem always replace old one during we course of exploration and transformation .
this be why we system need to be constantly improve , why reform can not be accomplish in one stroke and why we can not rest on we laurel indefinitely once exist problem be solve .

part 16 compose the third section , organizational leadership , which mainly elaborate on strengthen and improve the party ’s leadership in the course of continue the reform comprehensively .
here , i would like to explain the consideration of the cpc central committee on the major issue and key measure mention in the decision of the third plenary session of the 18th cpc central committee .
first , allow the market to play the decisive role in allocate resource and let the government perform its function better .
this be a major theoretical proposition in the decision , because the reform of the economic system be still the focus of continue the reform comprehensively , and the appropriate handling of the relationship between the government and the market be still the core issue of the reform of the economic system .
in 1992 the party ’s 14th national congress stipulate that china ’s economic reform aim at establish a socialist market economy , allow the market to play a basic role in allocate resource under state macro control .
this key breakthrough in theory play a extremely important role in guide china ’s reform and opening-up effort , and its economic and social development .
it also illustrate that theoretical innovation pave the way for innovation in practice .
to comprehensively continue the reform we must renew we theory first .
after 20 year of practice a socialist market economy have be basically establish in china .
but there be still many problem .
the market lack order , and many people seek economic benefit through unjustified means ; the market for factor of production lag behind in development , unable to allocate the factor of production to meet the effective demand ; the lack of unified market rule have result in rampant protectionism initiate by department or local government ; and market competition be not good enough to select the superior and eliminate the inferior , and thus slow down economic restructuring .
if leave unsolved , these problem will hinder the development of a sound socialist market economy .
over the past two decade since the party ’s 14th national congress we have keep search for a new position for the relationship between the government and the market through practice and theoretical research .
the party ’s 15th national congress propose that “ the market play a basic role in allocate resource under state macro control , ” the party ’s 16th national congress propose to “ give fuller play to the basic role of the market in allocate resource , ” the party ’s 17th national congress seek to “ introduce institution to give better play to the basic role of the market in allocate resource , ” and the party ’s 18th national congress stipulate that the party should “ leverage to a greater extent and in a wider scope the basic role of the market in allocate resource . ”
from the above progression it can be see that we have be constantly deepen we understanding of the government-market relationship .
during the discussion and consultation session regard the decision , many people suggest that the party should further define the government-market relationship from a theoretical perspective , which would have great significance for continue the reform comprehensively .
with due consideration to these opinion and the current circumstance , and after much discussion and research , the party central committee agree that it be time to introduce a new theoretical expression concern this matter , and that the “ basic role ” of the market in allocate resource should be revise to a “ decisive role . ”
we have now basically establish a socialist market economy in we country , with considerable improvement in the degree of marketization .
we have gain better knowledge of the market rule and enhance we capacity to use it to we benefit , and have improve the macro-control system .
with both the subjective and objective condition in place , we should take a new step forward to improve we socialist market economy .
to further balance the relationship between the government and the market we need to decide which of the two be to play the decisive role in allocate resource .
to boost the economy we must enhance the efficiency of the allocation of resource , especially that of scarce resource , so that we can use fewer resource to make more product and gain more benefit .
both theory and practice have prove that the allocation of resource by the market be the most effective means to this end .
it be a general rule of the market economy that the market decide the allocation of resource , and a market economy in essence be one in which the market determine resource allocation .
we have to follow this rule when we improve the socialist market economy .
we should work harder to address the problem of market imperfection , too much government interference and lack of oversight .
position the market as play a “ decisive role ” in resource allocation be conducive to establish the correct notion of the government-market relationship in the whole party and the whole of society , and conducive to transform the economic growth pattern and government function , as well as rein in corruption and other form of misconduct .
we market economy be socialist , of course .
we need to give leverage to the superiority of we socialist system , and let the party and government perform they positive function .
the market play a decisive role in allocate resource , but be not the sole actor in this regard .
to develop the socialist market economy , leverage should be give to both the market and the government , with differentiate function .
the decision put forth clear requirement for improve the function of the government , emphasize that scientific macro control and effective governance be the intrinsic requirement for give more leverage to the advantage of the socialist market economy .
the decision also make plan for improve macro control , correctly perform government function in all area , and improve the organization of government .
it stress that the main responsibility and role of the government be to maintain the stability of the macro economy , strengthen and improve public service , ensure fair competition , strengthen market oversight , maintain market order , promote sustainable development and common prosperity , and intervene in situation where market failure occur .
second , adhering to and improve the basic economic system .
the basic economic system with public ownership play a lead role and all form of ownership grow side by side be a important pillar of the socialist system with chinese characteristic .
since the introduction of the reform and opening-up policy in 1978 the structure of ownership have undergo gradual adjustment , with the weight of the public and non-public sector change in they contribution to the economy and employment .
the economy and society have grow more vigorous during this process .
in such condition , how to better recognize the lead role of public ownership and stick to this position and how to further explore the effective form for materialize the basic economic system have become major topic for we .
it be emphasize in the decision that we must unswervingly consolidate and develop the public economy , persist in the lead role of public ownership , give full play to the lead role of the state-owned economy , and incessantly increase its vitality , leverage power and impact .
adhere to and further the relevant deliberation make since the party ’s 15th national congress , the decision propose to vigorously develop the mixed-ownership economy .
it stress that such a economy , with cross-shareholding by and integration of state-owned capital , collective capital and non-public capital , be important to materialize the basic economic system of china .
it will help to improve the function of state-owned capital , maintain and increase its value and raise its competitiveness .
it be a effective channel and inevitable choice for we to adhere to the lead role of public ownership and improve the vitality , leverage power and impact of the state-owned economy in the new condition .
the decision state that china will improve the state asset management system , strengthen state asset oversight with capital management at the core , and reform the authorize operation mechanism for state capital .
state-owned capital investment operation must serve the strategic goal of the state , invest more in key industry and area that be vital to national security and be the lifeblood of the economy , focus on offer public service , develop important and future-oriented strategic industry , protect the ecological environment , support scientific and technological progress , and guarantee national security .
the government will transfer part of the state-owned capital to social security fund .
we will increase the proportion of state-owned capital gain that be turn over to the public finance , to be use to ensure and improve the people ’s livelihood .
state-owned enterprise ( so ) constitute a important force for advance modernization and protect the common interest of the people .
through many year of reform so have by and large assimilate themselves into the market economy .
at the same time , however , they have also find problem and drawback in they system , which call for further reform .
the decision propose a series of target reform measure : we must ensure that state-owned capital increase its input into public-service-oriented enterprise ; in natural monopoly industry in which state-owned capital continue to hold control interest , carry out a reform focus on separation of government administration from enterprise management , separation of government administration from state asset management , franchise operation , and government oversight , separate network ownership from operation , and deregulate control over competitive business in light of the condition of different industry ; improve the corporate governance structure to ensure smooth operation and effective check and balance ; establish a system of professional manager , and give better play to the role of business executive ; establish a long-term incentive-and-restraint mechanism , and strengthen investigation into the accountability of soe operation and investment ; and explore way to publicize important information , include soe financial budget .
moreover , so should appropriately increase the proportion of market-based recruitment , and properly determine and strictly regulate the salary level , post-related benefit and expense as well as business spending of soe managerial personnel .
these measure will stimulate so to improve the modern corporate system , enhance they operating efficiency , better fulfill they social obligation and play a better role in the economy .
we must adhere to the “ two unswervinglys ” in order to continue and improve we basic economic system .
the decision propose reform measure on multiple level to encourage , support and guide the development of the non-public sector of the economy , and to stimulate its vigor and creativity .
on functional position , the decision point out that both the public and non-public sector be important component of the socialist market economy , and a important basis for china ’s economic and social development .
on the protection of property rights , the decision point out that the property rights of both the public and non-public sector be inviolable .
on policy treatment , the decision stress equal rights , equal opportunity and identical rule , and a unified market access system .
the decision encourage non-public enterprise to participate in the reform of so , encourage development of mixed-ownership enterprise in which private capital hold majority share , and encourage qualified private enterprise to establish a modern corporate system .
all these will contribute to the healthy development of the non-public sector of the economy .
third , continue the reform of the fiscal and taxation system .
finance be the foundation and a important pillar of national governance .
good fiscal and taxation system be the institutional guarantee for improve resource allocation , maintain market unity , promote social equity , and realize enduring peace and stability .
develop on the basis of the tax distribution system reform initiate in 1994 , the current fiscal and taxation system have play a important role in increase the government ’s financial strength and promote the rapid growth of the economy .
as the situation change , the current fiscal and taxation system can not effectively respond to the requirement for divide power between the central and local government to improve national governance .

the unbalanced development between urban and rural area be a serious problem hinder the development of we economy and society , a major problem we must solve in order to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects and accelerate socialist modernization .
tremendous change have take place in china ’s rural area since the reform and opening-up policy be introduce in late 1978 .
however , the separate urban-rural structure have not change fundamentally , and the widen gap between urban and rural development have not be reverse .
to solve these problem , we must push forward the integrate development of urban and rural area .

the judiciary be a important component of the political system .
miscarriage of justice have be a major concern of the people in recent year , and the judiciary suffer a lack of credibility largely due to its current defective system and operation mechanism , which need improvement .
judicial reform be one of the key point in continue the reform comprehensively .

all these measure be base on past experience and the suggestion of various group and individual .
eighth , accelerate the improvement of the leadership for the management of the internet .
cyber security and information security bear on national security and social stability , and pose new challenge for we in many aspect .
fall behind the rapid development of internet technology and application , we current management of the internet be seriously flawed and can not function properly .
different administrative body engage in multi-channel management of the internet , overlap function and mismatch between power and responsibility – all these have lead to inefficient management .
also , as the internet grow into a new form of the media , the management of this online medium and the industry be lag far behind the development of the business .
with fast growth in the number of the user of micro-blog , wechat and other social network service and instant communication tool , which spread information quickly over wide area and can mobilize large number of user , how to strengthen oversight within a legal framework and guide public opinion and how to ensure the orderly dissemination of online information , while at the same time safeguard national security and social stability , have become press problem for we .

ninth , establish the national security commission .
national security and social stability form the basis for further reform and progress .
currently we be challenge by pressure from two source : internationally we must safeguard state sovereignty , national security and we development interest , and domestically we need to maintain political and social stability .
all kind of foreseeable and unforeseeable risk be increase significantly , but we security system be not good enough to meet the demand of ensure national security .
we need to establish a strong platform to coordinate we national security work .
for this purpose , establish the national security commission to strengthen unified leadership of national security at the central level have become a urgent matter .
the main responsibility of the national security commission be to formulate and implement national security strategy , promote national security legislation , design principle and policy for national security work , and discuss and resolve key issue concern national security .
tenth , improve the country ’s natural resource management and oversight system .
improving the country ’s natural resource management system be a important reform for develop the property right system for natural resource .
it be also the intrinsic requirement for build a ecologically friendly country with complete support system .
some of we major frustration in ecological protection be cause by problem in the ecological management system .
one problem lie in the vague concept of ownership of natural resource by the whole people , which lead to problem in the identification of the rights and interest of the owner .
to solve this problem , the decision put forth measure for improve the natural resource management system .
the guide thought be : ensure people ’s property rights to natural resource accord to the principle of separation between ownership and management , one issue belong to one department , and establish a unify responsibility mechanism for people who act on behalf of the public to manage public natural resource asset .
there be a difference between the state ’s exercise of power and management over the natural resource asset own by the whole people and the state ’s supervision and management of the natural resource within its territory .
the former be the owner ’s right , while the latter be the manager ’s right .
this require we to improve the system of oversight of natural resource , and fulfill we duty as the manager of we territorial space .
the owner of state-owned natural resource asset and the manager of state natural resource must act independently , while cooperate with and supervise each other .
we need to realize that we mountain , water , forest , farmland and lake form a living community .
the lifeline of the people come from the farmland , that of the farmland come from the water , that of the water come from the mountain , that of the mountain come from the earth , and that of the earth come from the tree .
to control the exploitation of natural resource and restore the ecosystem , we must follow the law of nature .
if people only tend to they own responsibility , for example , grow tree , regulate river or protect farmland in isolation , they be prone to gain in one area and lose in another , which eventually lead to systemic destruction of the ecology .
therefore , it be of the utmost importance to put one department in charge of the usage of the entire territory of a country , and carry out unify protection and restoration program for its natural resource .
eleventh , establish the lead group for continue the reform comprehensively under the cpc central committee .
continue the reform comprehensively be a complicated system engineering project , which require more than one or several department to carry out .
therefore , leadership at a higher level should be establish for this purpose .
the decision stipulate that the party central committee will set up the lead group for continue the reform comprehensively .
this be to give better play to the party ’s core function as leader have a picture of the whole situation and as chief coordinator of different aspect , so as to ensure the reform progress smoothly and the assign task be implement as plan .
the main responsibility of this lead group be plan key national reform , promote coordinate reform in various field , coordinate various force into a joint force for reform , strengthen supervision and oversight , and promote full implementation of the reform ’s aim and task .
iii . several matter that require attention in discussion
the task of this plenary session be to discuss the guide thought and plan for continue the reform comprehensively as propose in the decision .
for the discussion , please bear the follow in mind :
first , we must be more confident and courageous in push forward reform .
reform and open up be a new great revolution of the chinese people lead by we party in the new era .
it be the most outstanding characteristic of contemporary china , and the distinctive feature of we party .
what have help we party inspire the people , unify they and pull they strength together over the past 35 year ?
what have we be rely on to stimulate the creativity and vitality of we people , realize rapid economic and social development and win a competitive advantage over capitalism ?
the answer have always be reform and open up .
look to the future , there be no alternative to continue reform and open up if we be to solve all sort of difficult problem hinder we development , defuse risk and meet challenge in all aspect , give better play to the advantage of socialism with chinese characteristic , and promote the steady and healthy development of the economy and society .
at the current stage , close attention to we reform and opening-up drive come from inside and outside the party and inside and outside the country as well .
the entire party and all sector of society have high expectation for we .
we reform have come to a critical juncture .
we must not waver in the slightest degree in carry out reform and open up , and we must continue to uphold and firmly adhere to the correct path of socialism with chinese characteristic .
the whole party must reaffirm we conviction to push forward reform with greater political courage and wisdom , and stronger measure and method .
second , we must continue to free we mind and seek truth from fact .
to keep we banner of reform and open up fly high , we must also take pragmatic measure once we have a strong conviction .
action speak louder than word .
it be a strategic choice of the cpc central committee to make overall plan for continue the reform comprehensively at the third plenary session of the 18th cpc central committee .
we must take this opportunity to make new breakthrough in we reform .
for this to happen , we need to further free we mind .
to break down the barrier of old notion and the fence of interest group , free the mind be the first and most important step .
often , the roadblock in we mind that hinder reform do not come from outside the system , but from within .
if the mind be not free we can hardly see the crux of we problem with the interest group , or pinpoint the direction of we effort to break down the barrier .
we will also find it difficult to come up with innovative reform measure .
therefore , we must have the courage and breadth of vision to seek self-improvement .
we need to throw off the trammel of outdated idea and overcome the constraint put in place by various department for they own interest , and proactively conduct research and propose reform measure .
before put forth a reform measure , we must research and discuss it carefully , but this do not mean be overcautious or hesitant to try anything new .
it be not possible to carry out reform while keep we current work pattern and operation system intact , nor be it possible to do it in a rock-steady or risk-free manner .
as long as we have do thorough research and appraisal , and know what we be go to do agree with the actual condition and need to be do , we will go ahead without look back .
third , we must put the interest of the state first when make deliberation .
continue the reform comprehensively be a major strategic plan concern the overall development of the party and the state , rather than a single program to reform a certain aspect of a sector .
“ one who fail to plan for the whole situation be incapable of plan for a partial area . ”
you come from different department and unit , and you need to see thing from a wider perspective .
for major decision , first we should judge whether a propose reform measure meet the need of the country , and whether it be conducive to the long-term development of the cause of the party and the state .
we must strive to look forward into the future , think beyond the time , and proactively draw up plan .
this will enable we to put through reform measure that will genuinely promote the cause of the party and the people .
to continue the reform comprehensively , we should strengthen planning at the top level and adopt a holistic approach in do so .
we should study more intensively the connectedness , consistency and feasibility of we reform measure .
as we say , “ we must push reform forward boldly and steadily . ”
here “ steadily ” means adopt a holistic approach in planning , do overall research and make decision scientifically .
reform in the economy , politics , culture , society and ecology be closely connect to and integrate in the reform of party building .
reform in one sector will always affect other sector and require other sector to reform accordingly .
if reform in different area do not support each other , and the measure take in some sector turn out to check the progress of other sector , we will find it difficult to continue the reform comprehensively ; we will get into a muddle with the reform if we disregard these factor .
align we think with the guideline of the third plenary session of the 18th cpc central committee
november 12 , 2013
we have to unify the thinking and will of the whole party first in order to unify the thinking and will of the people of all china ’s ethnic group so that everyone work together to advance we reform .
here , i need to make a few point on how we should implement the guideline of the plenary session , with the focus on the guide principle , overall plan , objective and task it have set forth .
first , we must take improve and develop the socialist system with chinese characteristic and modernize we national governance system and capacity as the general goal of continue the reform comprehensively .
deng xiaoping say in 1992 that it would probably take another 30 year for we to develop a more mature and well-defined system in every field .
base on he strategic thought , the plenary session propose modernize we national governance system and capacity .
this be something that must be do to improve and develop the socialist system and to achieve socialist modernization .
we decide to focus on the question of continue the reform comprehensively at the plenary session – not the reform of one or several field , but of all area .
we make this decision out of the overall consideration of improve we national governance system and capacity .
the national governance system and capacity of a country epitomize not only its many system but also how well it can enforce they .
we national governance system be a system of institution within which the country be govern with the leadership of the party .
it comprise economic , political , cultural , social and ecological as well as party-building system and mechanism , law and regulation .
this be a complete set of closely connected and coordinate system of the state .
we national governance capacity be the ability to use these system to manage social affair , include reform , development and stability , domestic and foreign affair , national defense , and the running of the party , state and military .
we national governance system and capacity complement each other and form a organic whole .
a effective governance system will lead to greater governance capacity , while greater governance capacity can make the governance system more effective .
actually , how to govern a socialist society , a completely new society , have not be clearly address by world socialism so far .
karl marx and friedrich engels have no practical experience in the comprehensive governance of a socialist country , as they theory about a future society be mostly predictive .
vladimir lenin , who pass away a few year after the october revolution ( 1917 ) in russia , be thus unable to explore this question in depth .
the soviet union tackle this question and gain some experience , but it make serious mistake and fail to resolve the problem .
we party have work on the same question steadily ever since it come to national power , and , in spite of serious setback , have accumulate rich experience and achieve great success in improve we governance system and enhance we governance capacity .
the success have be particularly resounding since we adopt the policy of reform and open up .
enjoy political stability , economic growth , social harmony and ethnic unity , today ’s china pose a striking contrast to many region and country that suffer constant chaos .
this show that we national governance system and capacity be on the whole quite sound and suit to we national condition and development need .
at the same time , we should also realize that , compare with china ’s need for social and economic development and we people ’s expectation , and compare with today ’s increasingly intense international competition , and the need to ensure prolonged stability at home , we still have many shortcoming to overcome in improve we national governance system and capacity .
to realize genuine social harmony and stability , and lasting peace and security , we must rely on we effective institution , we high capacity in governance and we high-caliber personnel .
to give free rein to the advantage of chinese socialism , we must promote the modernization of we national governance system and capacity in all field .
to modernize we national governance system and capacity we should adapt properly to the change time , and reform outdated system , mechanism , law and regulation , while build new one to make we institution in all respects more appropriate and complete and the governance of party , state and social affair more institutionalized , standardized and procedure-based .
we should pay more attention to build we governance capacity , enhance we awareness of the need to act in accordance with institution and the law , and we skill in run the country with institution and the law , transform we institutional advantage into greater governance effectiveness , and enhance the party ’s capacity to govern in a effective and democratic way , and in accordance with the law .
second , we must further free we mind , further release and develop the productive force , and further stimulate and strengthen the vigor of society .
the “ three further ” put forward at the plenary session be both objective and condition of we reform .
free we mind be a prerequisite or the ultimate switch for release and develop the productive force , and strengthen the vigor of we society .
without free we mind , we party would not have be able to make the historic decision to shift the focus of the work of the party and the country to economic development and launch reform and open up shortly after the ten-year turmoil of the cultural revolution , usher in a new era in china ’s development .
without free we mind , we party would not have be able to promote theoretical and practical innovation , remove risk and challenge effectively to advance reform and open up steadily , and remain at the forefront of the time .
release and develop the productive force , and stimulating and strengthen the vigor of we society be a inevitable outcome as well as a important basis for free the mind .
to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects , achieve socialist modernization and the great renewal of the chinese nation , the most essential and urgent task be to further release and develop the productive force .
the purpose of free we mind , and stimulating and strengthen the vigor of society be to better release and develop the productive force .
deng xiaoping say , “ revolution mean the emancipation of the productive force , and so do reform .
after the basic socialist system have be establish it will be necessary to fundamentally change the economic structure that have hamper the development of the productive force and to establish a vigorous socialist economic structure that will promote they development . ”
by continue reform , we will unleash the vitality of work , knowledge , technology , management , capital and other factor to open a abundance of social wealth .
in addition , we must keep vitality and order in proper balance , as society need vitality to progress , but such vitality should be accompany by order .
neither a pool of stagnant water nor a surge undercurrent be what we want .
we stress the need to have confidence in we path , in we theory and in we system .
in other word , we need to have strong will power and faith .
at the same time , we also need a strong material power that bolster such will power and faith .
this require constant reform and innovation to ensure that chinese socialism be more efficient than capitalism in release and develop the productive force , stimulate and strengthen the vigor of society and promote a well-rounded development of the person , and the arouse of greater enthusiasm , initiative and creativity among the people , create more favorable condition for social development , and show a better edge in competition , thus fully display its advantage .
third , we must keep we focus on economic reform , and give full play to they catalytic role .
the plenary session present a road map for further reform comprehensively , with “ six centering-on , ” stress the need to focus on economic reform and they leading role .
the basic fact that china be still in the primary stage of socialism and will long remain so have not change ; nor have the principal problem in we society , namely , inadequacy in meet the ever-growing material and cultural need of the people , because of backward social production ; and nor have china ’s international position as the world ’s largest develop country .
all this dictate that economic development will remain the focus of the work of the whole party .
currently , most structural and institutional barrier hinder china ’s proper development be find in the economy .
we economic reform have not be complete , nor have the potential of such reform be fully release .
to keep economic development as we central task we must continue to focus on economic reform without the slightest hesitation .
the economic base determine the superstructure .
economic reform have a significant and pervasive bearing on the reform of other field .
and the tempo of progress in major economic reform determine that of a host of other reform , play a critical part in the overall situation .
in the “ preface to a contribution to the critique of political economy , ” karl marx observe that “ in the social production of they existence , man inevitably enter into definite relation , which be independent of they will , namely , relation of production appropriate to a give stage in the development of they material force of production .
the totality of these relation of production constitute the economic structure of society , the real foundation , on which arise a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite form of social consciousness . ”
as we continue to reform comprehensively , we should keep we focus on economic reform , and strive to make breakthrough in the reform of key field , so that such breakthrough will drive and stimulate reform in other area , and ensure that these reform can work together and progress in concert .
we should not take a fragmented and uncoordinated approach in this regard .
fourth , we must uphold the direction of reform towards a socialist market economy .
identify we reform as aim to establish a socialist market economy be a significant theoretical and practical innovation we party make in the course of building socialism with chinese characteristic .
this resolve a major problem that other socialist country have long fail to resolve .
over the past two decade or so we have advance economic and other reform center on the goal of establish a socialist market economy , and realize a great historic transition from a highly centralized plan economy to a robust socialist market economy , from seclusion and semi-seclusion to all-dimensional open up , and from a life of subsistence to one of initial prosperity .
the historic leap forward by which china ’s economy rise to the second place in the world have greatly increase the enthusiasm of the chinese people , greatly boost the development of china ’s productive force , and add great vigor to the party and the country .
at the same time , we should also be aware that although we socialist market economy have take shape initially , it be not complete as a system , and it be not yet mature .
in particular , a balance between the role of the government and that of the market in effectively and unrestrictedly allocate resource be yet to be establish .
so we have to make strenuous effort to fulfill the strategic task of quickly improve we socialist market economy set by the 18th party congress .
the key to establish a sound socialist market economy lie in strike a proper balance between the role of the government and that of the market , so that the market can play a decisive role in allocate resource and the government can play its own role more effectively .
this represent another major step forward in we party ’s theoretical and practical exploration .
establish a sound socialist market economy be not only the basic need for the economic reform , but also the core requirement for comprehensively continue we reform .
let the market play a decisive role in allocate resource will mainly require economic reform , but it will also inevitably affect politics , culture , society , ecological progress and party building .
institutional reform of all area should be promote in concert with establish a sound socialist market economy , while ensure that they related link better meet the demand of a grow socialist market economy .
fifth , we must make the promotion of social fairness and justice and the improvement of well-being both the start point and ultimate goal .
since the beginning of reform and open up , china have make remarkable achievement in economic and social development , which provide a solid material foundation and favorable condition for social fairness and justice .
nevertheless , give the current level of development , injustice and inequality be still quite common in we society .
as china develop further and the people ’s living standard improve , public awareness of equality and democracy , and of rights and interest have be steadily enhance , and hence people ’s resentment at injustice become more pronounced .
after comprehensively review and analyze china ’s current social and economic development , the cpc central committee have conclude that this problem , if not resolve in good time , will reduce public confidence in we reform and open up , and undermine social harmony and stability .
as the 18th party congress point out , fairness and justice be inherent requirement of socialism with chinese characteristic .
we must , rely on the concerted effort of all the chinese people and base on economic and social development , step up effort to develop institution that be vital to ensure social fairness and justice ; establish in due course a system for ensure fairness in society feature , among other thing , equal rights , equal opportunity and fair rule for all ; and foster a fair social environment and ensure the people ’s equal right to participation in governance and to development .
this plenary session stress that to comprehensively continue reform we must make the promotion of social fairness and justice , and improvement of the people ’s life both the start point and ultimate goal .
this be a necessary requirement of the fundamental purpose of we party , which be to serve the people wholeheartedly .
comprehensively further the reform must be the guarantee of build a more equitable and just social environment , address breach of equity and justice , and bring more of the benefit of development to all the people in a fairer fashion .
if we can not deliver tangible benefit to the people , and create a fairer social environment , and , worse still , if we cause more inequality , then we reform will lose its meaning and can not be sustain .
realize social fairness and justice require multiple factor , a higher level of social and economic development be the most crucial one .
understand of and desire for social fairness and justice may differ when there be difference in development level and historical period , and people ’s outlook and social background .
when we speak of social fairness and justice , we mean to proceed from the fundamental interest of the overwhelming majority of the people , and view and address this problem from the larger picture of social development , social harmony and the people as a whole .
the violation of social fairness and justice in the country be mainly fundamental problem in the course of development , which can be resolve by institutional , legal and policy arrangement in tandem with continued development .
we must take economic development as the central task , promote sustained and sound growth , and “ make the cake bigger , ” thereby lay a more solid material foundation for greater social fairness and justice .
this do not mean that we should wait to address the problem of social fairness and justice until the economy be develop .
the nature of the problem may differ from period to period , bear the feature of society – develop or not so developed – in which they be find .
even when the “ cake ” have indeed become bigger , we must cut it fairly .
the chinese people have always have a perception that “ inequality rather than want be the cause of trouble . ”
base on continued development , we should do a better job of promote fairness and justice , try we best while be mindful of we limitation so that we can keep make progress in ensure people ’s access to education , remunerable employment , health care , old-age care and housing .
no matter what development level a society be at , institution be always a indispensable guarantee of social fairness and justice .
we should strive to overcome injustice and inequality cause by man-made factor through innovative institutional arrangement , and ensure we people ’s rights to equal participation and development .
we should take social fairness and justice and the living standard of the people as a mirror to examine we system , mechanism , policy and regulation in all respects , and introduce reform accordingly by focus on area where the problem of injustice and inequality be most prevalent .
as for problem cause by unsound institutional arrangement , timely measure should be take to reflect better the principle of fairness and justice in we socialist society and better realize , maintain and develop the fundamental interest of we people .
sixth , we must rely on the people to promote reform .
the people be the creator of history and the source of we strength .
the fundamental reason why we reform and open up have win the people ’s wholehearted support and vigorous participation all along lie in the fact that from the very begin we let the cause strike deep root among the people .
the decision of this plenary session review the valuable experience of we reform and open up , one of which highlight the importance of put people first , respect they principal position in the country , give free rein to they creativity , and promote reform with the close support of the people .
in the absence of the people ’s support and participation , no reform can possibly succeed .
no matter what difficulty and challenge we may encounter , we will prevail as long as we have the people ’s support and participation .
we must implement the party ’s mass line and rally closely with the people , share weal and woe with they , and work vigorously by they side .
to push forward any key reform we must have the major issue concern the reform examine and address from the people ’s standpoint , while formulate guideline and measure base on the people ’s interest .
wang fu of the eastern han dynasty ( 25-220 ) say , “ the roc soar lithely not merely because of the lightness of one of its feather ; the steed run fast not merely because of the strength of one of its leg . ”
if china want to fly high and run fast , it must rely on the strength of its 1.3 billion people .
when we encounter complicated problem hard to weigh and balance in the course of comprehensively promote reform , we should think of the actual condition of the people .
what be they expect ?
how can they interest be safeguard ?
be they satisfy with we reform ?
to make we decision on reform more appropriate , the most important thing be to listen extensively to the opinion and proposal of the people , promptly review they fresh experience , fully mobilize they enthusiasm , initiative and creativity , bring they wisdom and strength to the cause of reform , and work with they to move the cause forward .

we must improve the general public ’s ability to manage state , social , economic and cultural affair in accordance with the law .
in this way , party , state and social affair will be administer in accordance with rule , standard and procedure , and we will become better able to govern the country through the socialist system with chinese characteristic .

this be a prerequisite for adhering to and develop socialism with chinese characteristic and for realize socialist modernization .
since the introduction of the reform and opening-up policy some three decade ago , we party have begin to ponder the issue of national governance system from a new perspective , and come to the conclusion that the issue of leadership and organizational system be fundamental , comprehensive , stable and permanent one .
today , we be task with a important historic mission , that be to make we socialist system with chinese characteristic more mature and better establish , and provide a set of more complete , more stable and more effective system for the development of the party and the nation , the well-being of the people , social harmony and stability , and the enduring prosperity and stability of the country .
this be a grand project .
it entail carry out all-round and systematic reform , and integrate reform in various field to promote the overall modernization of we national governance system and capacity .
a country ’s governance system and capacity be the major barometer of its system and that system ’s govern efficiency .
the two be complementary .
we governance system and capacity be good overall and have unique advantage .
moreover , they suit we national condition and development need .
nevertheless , we national governance system and capacity still have much room for improvement , and we should exert greater effort to enhance we national governance capacity .
we governance system will become more efficient as long as we focus on improve the party ’s governance capacity while raise the moral and political standard , scientific and cultural level , and professional ability of official at all level and administrator of all area , and as long as we make party and government agency , enterprise , public institution , and social organization more efficient .

the kind of governance system best suit for a country be determine by that country ’s historical heritage and cultural tradition , and its level of social and economic development , and it be ultimately decide by that country ’s people .
we current national governance system have be develop and gradually improve over a long period of time on the basis of we historied heritage , cultural tradition , and social and economic development .
we national governance system need to be improve , but we should have we own opinion on what improvement be necessary .
the chinese nation be open-minded .
over century , we have be continuously draw on other ’ strength and shape the character of we own nation .
without unwaver confidence in we system we can not have the courage to further reform , and without continuous reform we confidence in the system can not possibly be full and long-lasting .
continue we reform to a deeper level involve improve we socialist system with chinese characteristic .
when we say boost we confidence in the system , we do not mean to be complacent .
instead , we should continue to eradicate drawback in the system , and make it more mature and more enduring .
to modernize we national governance system and capacity , we should foster and promote the core socialist value and the relevant system , and accelerate the building of a value system that fully reflect the characteristic of china , the chinese nation and the time .
to safeguard we value system and core value , we must let culture play its due role .
a nation ’s culture be a unique feature that distinguish that nation from other .
we should delve deeper into and better elucidate china ’s excellent traditional culture , and make greater effort to creatively transform and develop traditional chinese virtue , promote a cultural spirit that transcend time and national boundary , and have eternal attraction and contemporary value .
we should also present to the world china ’s contemporary creative cultural product that carry both we excellent traditional culture and contemporary spirit , and that be base in china and orient towards the outside world .
as long as the chinese people pursue lofty virtue generation after generation we nation will be forever fill with hope .
producing a good document be only the first step in the long march of thousand of mile .
the key be to implement the document .
we should meticulously and strenuously study and promote the guide principle of the third plenary session of the 18th cpc central committee , and gain a solid understanding of continued reform .
while study the document , we should not stop at the surface , quote it out of context , copy it mechanically or apply it blindly .
we should straighten out the relationship between the general policy arrangement and a particular policy , between a policy chain and a link , between top-level policy design and policy interface at different level , between policy consistency and diversity , and between long - and short-term policy .
we can not replace the whole with any part , nor can we compromise principle for the sake of flexibility , or vice versa .
while implement the document we should avoid empty talk , hesitation or seek quick success , and instant benefit .
we should implement it with a very strong sense of urgency and responsibility .
reform be a gradual process .
we should make bold breakthrough while advance step by step , so as to ensure the realization of the reform goal .
continue all-round reform to a deeper level be aim at serve the overall , basic and long-term interest of the country .
we should avoid pick reform area accord to personal preference , and should get rid of reform-hindering mindset .
we must firmly carry out reform that benefit the party and the people , and contribute to prosperity and long-term stability .
do this will enable we to fulfill we historic mission and we responsibility to the people , the country and the nation .

the “ invisible hand ” and the “ visible hand ”
may 26 , 2014
we should let the market play the decisive role in allocate resource , while allow the government to better perform its function .
this be a theoretical and practical issue of great importance .
a correct and precise understanding of this issue be very important to further the reform and promote the sound and orderly development of the socialist market economy .
we should make good use of the role of both the market , the “ invisible ” hand , and the government , the “ visible ” hand .
the market and the government should complement and coordinate with each other to promote sustained and sound social and economic development .
the third plenary session of the 18th cpc central committee point out that economic structural reform be the focus of continue the reform comprehensively .
the underlying issue be how to strike a balance between the function of the government and the role of the market , and let the market play the decisive role in allocate resource and the government better perform its function .
the proposal to let the market play the decisive role in allocate resource be a breakthrough in we party ’s understanding of the law govern the development of socialism with chinese characteristic as well as a new achievement in the sinicization of marxism .
it symbolize that the socialist market economy have enter a new stage .
to let the market play the decisive role in allocate resource and the government better perform its function we must have a good understanding of the relationship between the role of the market and that of the government , which represent a core issue in we economic structural reform .
the third plenary session of the 18th cpc central committee change the market ’s role in allocate resource from “ basic ” to “ decisive . ”
although only one word be alter , the market ’s role be redefine .
“ decisive role ” be a continuation and extension of “ basic role . ”
let the market play the decisive role in allocate resource and let the government better perform its function be not contradictory .
it do not mean that the market can replace the government ’s function , nor vice versa .
actually this be a effort to keep we economic reform target at exist problem .
for more than two decade we socialist market economy have be develop , yet there be still quite a number of problem and drawback that inhibit the vitality of market entity and prevent the law of the market and value from fully play they role .
if these problem be not solve properly it will be difficult to establish a well-developed socialist market economy , further transform the development model and adjust the economic structure .
we should remain committed to the reform to establish and improve the socialist market economy and bring the reform to a deeper and wider level .
we should reduce the government ’s direct involvement in resource allocation and its direct interference in micro-economic activity .
we should step up effort to develop a uniform market system characterize by openness and orderly competition , and set fair , open and transparent market rule .
the government should refrain from get involve in the economic activity that the market can regulate effectively , and let the market do what the government be not suppose to do , so that the market can play its role of maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of resource allocation , and enterprise and individual can have more room to develop the economy and create wealth with vigor and vitality .
scientific macro control and effective governance be the intrinsic requirement for give full play to the strength of the socialist market economy .
to ensure that the government better perform its function , we should transform government function , further the reform of the administrative system , use new administrative method , improve the macro-control system and enhance the monitoring of market activity .
we should strengthen and improve public service , and promote social fairness , justice and stability , as well as common prosperity .
government at all level should exercise administration strictly in accordance with the law , and conscientiously fulfill they responsibility .
the government should manage well all matter that fall within its purview , and appropriately delegate power that should be delegate .
the government should make resolute effort to avoid overstep its bound or fail to play its due role .
we should uphold the party ’s leadership and let the party play its role as the leadership core in exercise overall leadership and coordinate all effort .
this be a important feature of we socialist market economy .
over the last three decade since the introduction of the reform and opening-up policy , we have make marked achievement in we social and economic development , and the people ’s living standard have improve noticeably .
these success be attributable to the fact that we have firmly uphold the party ’s leadership , and give full play to the role of party organization at all level and of all party member .
in china , the party ’s strong leadership be the basic guarantee for the government to play its due role .
while comprehensively continue the reform , we should uphold and develop we political advantage , and use they to guide and push forward the reform .
we should motivate all the people to make constant effort for a better socialist market economy .
in the new situation today , official at all level , especially lead official , should continue to learn through practice , and put what they have learn into practice , study new problem and draw on new experience .
they should learn to correctly use both the “ invisible hand ” and the “ visible hand , ” and become expert in balance the relationship between the government and the market .
