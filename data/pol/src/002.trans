During more than 5,000 years of civilization development, the Chinese nation has made an indelible contribution to the progress of human civilization.
After modern times, our nation has gone through hardships, and the Chinese nation has come to the most dangerous time.
Since then, in order to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, countless people with lofty ideals have fought and failed again and again.
After the founding of the Communist Party of China, the Communist Party of China has united and led the people to work tirelessly to turn the poor and backward old China into a new China that is increasingly prosperous and strong. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has shown unprecedented bright prospects.
Our responsibility is to unite and lead the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, take over the baton of history, and continue to work hard for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, so that the Chinese nation can stand stronger and stronger among the nations of the world, and make new contributions to mankind. greater contribution.

Closely focus on upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, study, publicize and implement the spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(November 17, 2012)
The report of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China outlines a grand blueprint for building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, accelerating socialist modernization, and winning new victories for socialism with Chinese characteristics under new historical conditions. The political declaration and action plan of continuing to advance on the path of socialism and striving to build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way have pointed out the direction for the work of this session of the central leadership.
The Central Committee has issued a notice on earnestly studying, propagating and implementing the spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized the need to hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, stressed that socialism with Chinese characteristics is the fundamental achievement of the Party and the people's struggle, creation and accumulation for more than 90 years, which must be cherished, persisted, and continuously developed, and called on the whole party to make unremitting exploration. And grasp the laws of socialism with Chinese characteristics, maintain the vitality of the party forever, maintain the impetus for national development, and strive to open up broader prospects for the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
It can be said that upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics is a main thread running through the report of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
We must firmly grasp this main line, and regard upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics as the focus, focus, and foothold of studying and implementing the spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Only in this way can we learn more about the spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Party. Go deeper, understand more thoroughly, and implement more consciously.
Why am I stressing this point?
This is because the long-term practice of the party and the country has fully proved that only socialism can save China, and only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China.
Only by holding high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics can we unite and lead the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects when the Communist Party of China is 100 years old, and build a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious when the new China is 100 years old. Win a happier and better future for the Chinese people and the Chinese nation.
Focusing on adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, studying, publicizing and implementing the spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, I understand that the following aspects should be grasped from the combination of theory and practice.
First, a profound understanding of socialism with Chinese characteristics is a fundamental achievement achieved by the party and the people through long-term practice.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics was created in the new era of reform and opening up, and it is also based on the long-term struggle of our party. Relay exploration obtained.
Relying closely on the people, our party has fundamentally changed the future and destiny of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation, irreversibly ending the tragic fate of China's domestic and foreign troubles, poverty and weakness since modern times, and irreversibly opening the door to the continuous development and growth of the Chinese nation. , The historical march towards the great rejuvenation makes the Chinese nation with a history of more than 5,000 years of civilization stand in the forest of the world's nations with a brand-new attitude.
We must always remember the historic contributions made by the three generations of the Party's central leadership and the Party Central Committee with Comrade Hu Jintao as General Secretary to socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The first generation of the party's central leadership with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core provided valuable experience, theoretical preparation, and material basis for the creation of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
The second generation of the party's central leadership with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at its core successfully created socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The party's third-generation central collective leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core has successfully pushed socialism with Chinese characteristics into the 21st century.
In the new stage of the new century, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Hu Jintao as General Secretary has succeeded in upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics at a new historical starting point.
It can be seen that socialism with Chinese characteristics carries the ideals and explorations of several generations of Chinese Communists, embodies the long-cherished wishes and expectations of countless people with lofty ideals, and embodies the struggle and sacrifice of hundreds of millions of people. It is an inevitable choice for the development of Chinese society in modern times. , is the only way to develop and stabilize China.
Practice has fully proved that socialism with Chinese characteristics is the banner of unity, progress and victory of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people.
To build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, accelerate socialist modernization, and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, we must always hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics and unswervingly adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China required the whole party to have firm confidence in the path, theory, and system of socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is the fundamental reason.
Second, profoundly understand that socialism with Chinese characteristics is composed of the three-in-one road, theoretical system and system.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China clarified the scientific connotation of the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and their interrelationships, emphasizing that the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the way to achieve, and the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics It is a guide for action, the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the fundamental guarantee, and the three are unified in the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
This is the most distinctive feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
This summary tells us that socialism with Chinese characteristics is a close combination of practice, theory and system. It not only elevates successful practice to theory, but also guides new practice with correct theory, and timely upgrades the principles and policies that have achieved results in practice. system for the party and the state.
Therefore, socialism with Chinese characteristics is especially in its path, theoretical system, and system, especially in the internal connection of its realization methods, action guidelines, and fundamental guarantees, and especially in the unity of these three in socialism with Chinese characteristics. Great in practice.
In contemporary China, upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics means truly upholding socialism.
The road of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the only way to realize my country's socialist modernization and the only way to create a better life for the people.
The road of socialism with Chinese characteristics not only adheres to economic construction as the center, but also comprehensively promotes economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, social construction, ecological civilization construction and other constructions; it not only adheres to the four basic principles, but also adheres to reform and opening up; Not only continuously liberate and develop social productive forces, but also gradually realize the common prosperity of all people and promote the all-round development of people.
The theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the latest achievement of the Sinicization of Marxism, including Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of "Three Represents" and the Scientific Outlook on Development.
Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought must not be lost.
At the same time, we must focus on the practical problems of our country's reform, opening up and modernization drive and what we are doing, focus on the application of Marxist theory, focus on theoretical thinking on practical problems, focus on new practices and new develop.
In contemporary China, adhering to the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics is truly adhering to Marxism.
The socialist system with Chinese characteristics insists on organically combining the fundamental political system, the basic political system with the basic economic system, as well as specific systems such as various systems and mechanisms; The organic combination of people being the masters of the country and ruling the country according to law conforms to my country's national conditions, embodies the characteristics and advantages of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and is the fundamental institutional guarantee for China's development and progress.
It should be noted that the socialist system with Chinese characteristics is distinctive and efficient, but it is not perfect and mature.
The cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics continues to develop, and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics also needs to be continuously improved.
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his visit to the South in 1992: "I am afraid it will take another 30 years before we have formed a more mature and stereotyped system in all aspects."
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized that system construction should be placed in a prominent position and the advantages of my country's socialist political system should be brought into full play.
We must insist on promoting institutional innovation through theoretical innovation based on practice, adhere to and improve the existing system, proceed from reality, formulate some new systems in a timely manner, and build a system that is complete, scientifically standardized, and effective in operation, so as to make all aspects of the system more efficient. Mature and more stereotyped, providing a more effective institutional guarantee for the new victory of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Third, deeply understand the general basis, general layout, and general tasks of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized that the general basis for building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the primary stage of socialism, the general layout is five in one, and the general task is to realize socialist modernization and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
The summary of the "three generals" is high-level, concise, and concise.
A deep understanding and grasp of this new generalization will help us to deeply understand and grasp the true meaning and essence of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The general basis is emphasized because the primary stage of socialism is the greatest national condition and greatest reality of contemporary China.
Under any circumstances, we must firmly grasp the greatest national conditions, and to promote reform and development in any area must firmly base itself on this greatest reality.
Not only should we always base ourselves on the primary stage in economic construction, but also in political construction, cultural construction, social construction, and ecological civilization construction should always keep the primary stage in mind; After improving, keep the primary stage in mind; not only when planning long-term development, but also keep the primary stage in mind in daily work.
The party's basic line in the primary stage of socialism is the lifeline of the party and the country.
In practice, we must always adhere to "one center, two basic points" unswervingly, neither deviate from "one center" nor neglect "two basic points", and put the practice of the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics and firm communism together. Unity with lofty ideals, resolutely resist all kinds of wrong ideas about abandoning socialism, and consciously correct wrong ideas and policy measures that go beyond the stage.
Only in this way can we truly achieve neither underestimation nor arrogance, and earnestly win new victories of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Emphasis on the general layout is because socialism with Chinese characteristics is socialism with all-round development.
We must firmly grasp the top priority of the party's governance and rejuvenation of the country, always represent the development requirements of China's advanced productive forces, adhere to economic construction as the center, and on the basis of continuous economic development, coordinate the promotion of political construction, cultural construction, social construction, ecological construction Civilization construction and other aspects of construction.
With the deepening of my country's economic and social development, the status and role of ecological civilization construction has become increasingly prominent.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China incorporated the construction of ecological civilization into the overall layout of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which made the strategic position of ecological civilization construction more clear, and was conducive to integrating ecological civilization construction into economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, and social construction. process.
This is an important result of our Party's continuous deepening of practice and understanding of the laws of socialist construction.
In accordance with this general layout, we must promote the coordination of all aspects of the modernization drive, and promote the coordination between production relations and productive forces, superstructure and economic foundation.
The general task is emphasized because our party has shouldered the historical mission of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation since the day it was founded.
Our Party leads the people to carry out revolutionary construction and reforms to make the Chinese people prosperous, the country prosperous, and to revitalize the great Chinese nation.
In accordance with the strategic deployment of the "three-step" modernization drive, building a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and harmonious is the goal of our party and country in the entire primary stage of socialism.
The solemn mission of our party, the fundamental purpose of reform and opening up, and the goal of our country's struggle all focus on and boil down to this general task.
We must firmly hold on to this general task and persevere from generation to generation.
In different historical periods, our party has always put forward inspiring goals in accordance with the will of the people and the needs of career development, and united and led the people to strive for it.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of my country has enriched and improved the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way in accordance with the new changes in the domestic and international situation, and in line with the new economic and social development of our country and the new expectations of the general public. To better meet the new requirements of the people's will.
These goals and requirements are in line with the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way put forward by the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the new requirements of realizing the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way put forward by the Seventeenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and are also consistent with the overall layout of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The whole party and the whole country should work with one heart and one mind, work hard, be determined to innovate, forge ahead, and work together to achieve the goals of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and deepening reform and opening-up proposed at the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
Fourth, profoundly understand the basic requirements for winning a new victory for socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China put forward the basic requirements that must be firmly grasped to win the new victory of socialism with Chinese characteristics under the new historical conditions.
These basic requirements are based on the Party's basic theory, basic line, basic program, and basic experience, and are put forward by profoundly summarizing the practice of my country's socialist construction, especially the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics, over the past 60 years. They are the most essential things and reflect the ruling law of the Communist Party , the laws of socialist construction, and the laws of the development of human society, indicating that our party's understanding of the laws of socialism with Chinese characteristics has reached a new level.
The basic requirements put forward by the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China further answered the basic question of how to win the new victory of socialism with Chinese characteristics on the new historical journey.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics is the cause of hundreds of millions of people themselves, so we must give full play to the people's sense of ownership to better ensure that the people are the masters of the country.
Liberation and development of social productive forces is the fundamental task of socialism with Chinese characteristics, so we must adhere to economic development as the center and scientific development as the theme to achieve people-oriented, comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable scientific development.
Reform and opening up is the only way to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, we must always implement the spirit of reform and innovation in all aspects of state governance, and continuously promote the self-improvement and development of my country's socialist system.
Fairness and justice are the inherent requirements of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, on the basis of the common struggle of all people and economic and social development, we must step up the construction of a system that plays a major role in ensuring social fairness and justice, and gradually establish a social fairness guarantee system.
Common prosperity is the fundamental principle of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, we must make the fruits of development more and more equitable to benefit all people, and make steady progress towards common prosperity.
Social harmony is the essential attribute of socialism with Chinese characteristics, so we must unite all forces that can be united, maximize the factors of harmony, enhance social creativity, and ensure that people live and work in peace and contentment, society is stable and orderly, and the country is long-lasting.
Peaceful development is the inevitable choice of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, we must adhere to open development, cooperative development, and win-win development, expand the convergence of interests with all parties, and promote the building of a harmonious world of lasting peace and common prosperity.
The Communist Party of China is the core of leadership in the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, so it is necessary to strengthen and improve the leadership of the party, and give full play to the party's core leadership role in taking over the overall situation and coordinating all parties.
The basic requirements put forward by the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China are a positive response to the outstanding problems existing in my country's economic and social development, the difficult problems faced by reform and speeding up the transformation of the economic development mode, and the hot issues that cadres and the masses are generally concerned about. Entering the decisive stage of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way is the correct guidance for reform, development and stability, internal affairs, foreign affairs and national defense, and governance of the party, the country and the army.
These basic requirements involve not only productive forces and production relations, but also the economic base and superstructure, not only the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, but also the great new project of party building, and at the same time coordinating both domestic and international situations.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China has followed and embodied these basic requirements in the planning and deployment of various tasks.
By grasping these basic requirements, we will be able to better gather our strength, overcome difficulties, continue to promote scientific development, promote social harmony, continue to improve people's lives, enhance people's well-being, and complete the glorious and arduous tasks entrusted by the times.
Fifth, deeply understand and ensure that the party will always be the strong leadership core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized that our party shoulders the important task of uniting and leading the people to build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, promote socialist modernization, and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
If the Party is strong and strong, and the Party maintains flesh-and-blood ties with the people, the country will be prosperous and stable, and the people will be happy and healthy.
The development of the situation, the development of the cause, and the expectations of the people all require us to comprehensively promote the new great project of party building with the spirit of reform and innovation, and comprehensively improve the scientific level of party building.
Governing the country must first govern the party, and governing the party must be strict.
To this end, the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China put forward the general requirements and various tasks to comprehensively improve the scientific level of party building under the new situation.
The whole party must deeply study and comprehend it and implement it one by one.
The general requirements for party building put forward by the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China are not only aimed at inheriting and carrying forward the fundamental point of maintaining and developing the advanced nature of our party's Marxist party for more than 90 years, but also focusing on adapting to and responding to the world conditions under the new situation. , new changes in national conditions and party conditions.
Over the years, we have comprehensively advanced the new great project of party building, the party's governance capacity has been newly improved, the party's advanced nature and purity have been maintained and developed, and the party's leadership has been strengthened and improved.
At the same time, compared with the development and changes of domestic and foreign situations, and compared with the historical tasks undertaken by the Party, there is still a considerable gap in the Party's leadership and governance level, the construction of Party organizations, and the quality, ability, and style of Party members and cadres.
Especially in the new situation, strengthening and improving the party building is faced with "four tests" and "four dangers", and the task of implementing the party's management of the party and the strict management of the party is more arduous and urgent than ever before.
The whole party must enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility, firmly grasp the general requirements of party building, continuously improve the party's leadership and governance level, and improve the ability to resist corruption, change and risk, so that our party can be in the historical process of profound changes in the world situation. It has always been at the forefront of the times, has always been the backbone of the people of the whole country in the historical process of coping with various risks and tests at home and abroad, and has always been a strong leadership core in the historical process of upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Strengthening ideals and beliefs and sticking to the spiritual pursuit of the Communists have always been the foundation for the Communists to settle down.
Belief in Marxism, socialism and communism is the political soul of communists and the spiritual pillar for communists to withstand any test.
Figuratively speaking, ideals and beliefs are the spiritual "calcium" of communists. Without ideals and beliefs, if ideals and beliefs are not firm, they will be mentally "deficient in calcium" and suffer from "rickets."
In real life, some party members and cadres have problems of one kind or another. In the final analysis, they are lost in their beliefs and spirits.
The entire party must, in accordance with the deployment of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, thoroughly study and practice the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, especially the scientific concept of development, emphasize party spirit, pay attention to conduct, set an example, and be determined to strive for the realization of the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Close relations between the party and the masses, cadres and masses, and maintaining flesh-and-blood ties with the people have always been the foundation of our party's invincible position.
The future and destiny of a political party and a regime ultimately depend on the backing of the people.
If we are disconnected from the masses and lose the support and support of the people, we will also eventually fail.
We must adapt to the new characteristics and new requirements of mass work under the new situation, do a good job in organizing, publicizing, educating and serving the masses, learn from the masses with an open mind, accept the supervision of the masses sincerely, always take root in the people, benefit the people, and always maintain the Party The flesh-and-blood connection with the people has always been heart-to-heart, breath and common destiny with the people.
It is necessary to draw wisdom and strength from the great practice of the people, do a good job of obeying the will of the people, relieve the people's worries, and benefit the people's livelihood, and correct the behavior that damages the interests of the people.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed that the party's mass line education and practice activities should be carried out in the whole party with pragmatism and honesty as the main content.
The central government will make arrangements for this activity, and party committees at all levels must earnestly implement it, focus on solving outstanding problems that the people have strongly reflected on, and ensure that the activity is effective.
Opposing corruption, building clean politics, and maintaining the party's physical health have always been our party's clear political stance.
The construction of party conduct and clean government is a major political issue that the majority of cadres and masses have always paid attention to.
"Things must rot first, and then worms grow."
In recent years, in some countries, the long-term accumulation of contradictions has led to public grievances, social unrest, and the collapse of the regime, among which corruption is a very important reason.
A large number of facts tell us that the problem of corruption will become more and more serious, and eventually the party and the country will inevitably be destroyed!
We must wake up!
The serious violations of discipline and law that have occurred in our party in recent years are very bad in nature and have extremely bad political influence, which is shocking.
Party committees at all levels must take a clear-cut stand against corruption, prevent corruption more scientifically and effectively, ensure that the cadres are upright, the government is clean, and the politics are clean, and the political character of the Communists is upright and clean.
Leading cadres at all levels, especially senior cadres, must consciously abide by the code of integrity, be strict with themselves, and strengthen the education and restraint of relatives and staff around them.
All acts that violate Party discipline and state laws must be severely punished, and must not be lenient.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized that the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics is a long-term and arduous historical task, and we must prepare for a great struggle with many new historical characteristics.
All comrades in the Party must, with firmer beliefs and more tenacious efforts, unswervingly adhere to and keep pace with the times to develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and constantly enrich the practical, theoretical, national, and era characteristics of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Unite and lead the people of all ethnic groups in the country, strive to achieve the goals and tasks of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and continue to achieve the three historical tasks of advancing modernization, completing the reunification of the motherland, maintaining world peace, and promoting common development.
This is the historical responsibility of our generation of Communists, and we must devote all our wisdom and strength to it.
Unswervingly uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics
(January 5, 2013)
The issue of the road is the first issue that concerns the success or failure of the party's cause, and the road is the life of the party.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics is the dialectical unity of the theoretical logic of scientific socialism and the historical logic of Chinese social development. The only way to accelerate socialist modernization and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
All Party comrades must adhere to the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of "Three Represents", and the Scientific Outlook on Development, unswervingly uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the Marxist view of development, and insist that practice is the only criterion for testing truth, Give full play to the initiative and creativity of history, clearly understand the changes and changes in the world, national conditions, and party conditions, always have the spirit of opening up roads through mountains and building bridges when encountering rivers, forge ahead, explore boldly, and be brave and good at analyzing and answering questions in real life. We will continue to deepen reform and opening up, make discoveries, create and advance, and promote theoretical innovation, practical innovation, and institutional innovation.
The spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, said a thousand words and ten thousand, boiled down to one point, that is, upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.
This year marks the 31st anniversary of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pioneered socialism with Chinese characteristics, and for the first time systematically and tentatively answered a series of basic questions about how to build socialism, how to consolidate and develop socialism in a country with relatively backward economy and culture such as China. Inherited and developed Marxism, opened up a new realm of Marxism, and raised the understanding of socialism to a new scientific level.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics is socialism and not any other doctrine. The basic principles of scientific socialism cannot be lost. If you lose it, it will not be socialism.
What kind of doctrine a country implements depends crucially on whether the doctrine can solve the historical issues facing the country.
Both history and reality tell us that only socialism can save China, and only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China. This is the conclusion of history and the choice of the people.
With the continuous development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, our system will become more and more mature, the superiority of our socialist system will be further revealed, and our path will become wider and wider.
We just need to have such confidence in the road, in theory, and in the system, so as to truly achieve "strengthening despite thousands of hardships and persevering in the wind from east, west, north and south".
Our Party leads the people in socialist construction. There are two historical periods before and after the reform and opening up. These are two periods that are interrelated and have major differences, but in essence they are both the practice of our Party leading the people in socialist construction. explore.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics was created in the new era of reform and opening up, but it was also created on the basis that the basic socialist system has been established in New China and has been built for more than 20 years.
Although there are great differences in the ideological guidance, principles and policies, and practical work of socialist construction between these two historical periods, the two are by no means separate from each other, nor are they fundamentally opposed.
The historical period after the reform and opening up cannot be used to negate the historical period before the reform and opening up, nor can the historical period before the reform and opening up be used to negate the historical period after the reform and opening up.
It is necessary to adhere to the ideological line of seeking truth from facts, distinguish the mainstream from the tributaries, adhere to the truth, correct mistakes, carry forward experience, and draw lessons, and on this basis, continue to push forward the cause of the party and the people.
Marxism must continue to develop with the development of the times, practice and science, and cannot remain unchanged. Socialism has always been advancing in development.
Upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics is a big article, for which Comrade Deng Xiaoping determined the basic ideas and principles. Great articles have been written on this great article.
Now, the task of our generation of Communists is to continue writing this great article.
Adhering to Marxism and socialism must have a development perspective.
The more our career progresses and develops, the more new situations and problems we will face, the more risks and challenges we will face, and the more unpredictable things we will face.
We must enhance our sense of urgency, and be prepared for danger in times of peace. If we understand, we must understand, and if we do not understand, we must not understand; if we understand, we must strive to create conditions to do it, and if we do not understand, we must hurry up to study and understand.
Communist Party members, especially leading cadres of Party members, should be firm believers and loyal practitioners of the lofty ideal of communism and the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
We must not only firmly believe in taking the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, but also have the lofty ideal of communism in mind, unswervingly implement the basic line and basic program of the party in the primary stage of socialism, and do a good job in every current task.
Revolutionary ideals are higher than the sky.
If you do not have lofty ideals, you are not a qualified Communist Party member; you are not a qualified Communist Party member if you talk about lofty ideals without real work.
There are objective criteria to measure whether a Communist Party member or a leading cadre has the lofty ideal of communism. Whether it is hard work and honesty, whether it is possible to work hard for the ideal regardless of one's life, to struggle, to dedicate all of your energy and even your life.
All bewildered and hesitant viewpoints, all thoughts of time and pleasure, all selfish behaviors, and all inaction styles are incompatible with this.
Adhere to and make good use of the living soul of Mao Zedong Thought
(December 26, 2013)
The living soul of Mao Zedong Thought is the stand, viewpoint, and method that run through it. They have three basic aspects, namely, seeking truth from facts, the mass line, and independence.
Under the new situation, we must adhere to and make good use of the living soul of Mao Zedong Thought, build our party well, and continue to advance the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Seeking truth from facts is the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism, the fundamental requirement for Chinese Communists to understand and transform the world, and the basic ideological method, work method, and leadership method of our party.
Regardless of the past, present and future, we must insist on starting from reality, linking theory with practice, and testing and developing the truth in practice.
Comrade Mao Zedong said: "'facts' are all things that exist objectively, 'yes' are the internal connections of objective things, that is, regularities, and 'seeking' means that we study."
Comrade Mao Zedong also vividly likened seeking truth from facts to be "targeted".
We must insist on using the "arrow" of Marxism to shoot the "target" of Chinese revolution, construction and reform.
Adhere to seeking truth from facts, it is necessary to go deep into the reality to understand the original appearance of things.
It is necessary to look at the essence through the phenomenon, to discover the necessary connections within things from the chaotic phenomenon, to proceed from the laws of the existence and development of objective things, and to act in accordance with the objective laws in practice.
Adhering to seeking truth from facts is not a once and for all thing. Being realistic at one time and place does not mean that you can also be realistic at another time and at another place. Adhering to seeking truth from facts at one time and place does not mean that the conclusions and experience you have gained. It can also be applied at another time and another location that has changed.
We must consciously strengthen our belief in seeking truth from facts, strengthen our ability to seek truth from facts, and keep seeking truth from facts in our hearts and put them into practice at all times.
To insist on seeking truth from facts, we must clearly understand and correctly grasp the basic national conditions that our country is still in the primary stage of socialism and will be in the primary stage of socialism for a long time.
In advancing reform and development and formulating principles and policies, we must firmly base ourselves on the ultimate reality of the primary stage of socialism, fully reflect the inevitable requirements of this basic national condition, and insist that everything starts from this basic national condition.
Any tendency to go beyond reality and beyond the stage to be eager for success must be avoided, and any concepts and practices that lag behind reality, ignore profoundly changing objective facts and stick to old-fashioned and self-contained concepts and practices must be resolutely corrected.
Insisting on seeking truth from facts, we must insist on upholding the truth and correcting mistakes for the benefit of the people.
Have the courage and righteousness of being open-minded, selfless and fearless, based on facts, and dare to tell the truth, promptly discover and correct deviations in ideological understanding, mistakes in decision-making, and shortcomings in work, and promptly discover and solve various existing problems. Contradictions and problems make our thoughts and actions more in line with objective laws, the requirements of the times, and the aspirations of the people.
Adhere to seeking truth from facts, we must continue to promote theoretical innovation based on practice.
The basic principles of Marxism are universal truths and have eternal ideological value, but the classic Marxist writers do not exhaust the truth, but continue to open up the way to seek and develop the truth.
Today, adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, comprehensively deepening reforms, and effectively dealing with foreseeable and unforeseeable difficulties and risks on the road ahead will raise new topics, and we urgently need new theoretical answers.
We must promptly summarize the fresh experience created by the party's leadership and the people, and constantly open up new realms of the Sinicization of Marxism, so that contemporary Chinese Marxism can radiate a more splendid light of truth.
The mass line is the lifeline and fundamental work line of our party, and an important heirloom for our party to maintain its youthful vitality and combat effectiveness.
Regardless of the past, present and future, we must insist that everything is for the masses, everything depends on the masses, from the masses, to the masses, transforming the party's correct propositions into the conscious actions of the masses, and implementing the mass line into all aspects of governance of the country. in activity.
The mass line essentially embodies the basic principle of Marxism that the masses are the creators of history.
Only by adhering to this basic principle can we grasp the basic laws of historical progress.
Only by acting in accordance with the laws of history can we be invincible.
History has repeatedly proved that the people are the main force of historical development and social progress.
As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Once China's destiny is in the hands of the people themselves, China will be like the sun rising in the east, illuminating the earth with its own glorious flame."
To adhere to the mass line, we must insist that the people are the fundamental force that determines our future and destiny.
Adhering to the dominant position of the people and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people has always been a strong foundation for our party to remain invincible.
In front of the people, we will always be primary school students. We must consciously worship the people as teachers, seek advice from the capable, and ask the wise for advice; we must fully respect the will expressed by the people, the experience they have created, the rights they have, and the role they play.
We must cherish the power given by the people, make good use of the power given by the people, consciously let the people supervise the power, and rely closely on the people to create great historical achievements, so that the foundation of our party will always be as solid as a rock.
To adhere to the mass line, we must adhere to the fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly.
"The prosperity of government lies in the hearts of the people, and the abolition of government lies in the hearts of the people."
Serving the people wholeheartedly is the fundamental starting point and end point of all our party's actions, and it is the fundamental symbol that distinguishes our party from all other parties.
All Party work must be based on the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people.
To test the effectiveness of all our work, we must ultimately see whether the people have really benefited, whether people's lives have really been improved, and whether people's rights and interests have been truly guaranteed.
In the face of the people's new expectations for a better life, we must not be complacent or slack. We must make persistent efforts to make the fruits of development more and more equitable for all people, and make steady progress towards common prosperity.
To adhere to the mass line, we must maintain the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the masses.
The biggest political advantage of our party is to be in close contact with the masses, and the biggest danger after the party takes power is to break away from the masses.
Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We Communists are like seeds, and the people are like land.
When we arrive at a place, we must unite with the people there, and take root and blossom among the people. "
We must deeply root the views of the masses and the mass line in the thoughts of all comrades in the party, and truly implement them into the actions of every party member. We must do our utmost to solve the problems existing in the party, especially the problems that the people are not satisfied with, so that our party will always win the victory. The people trust and support.
Adhering to the mass line requires truly letting the people judge our work.
"The losers are in the grass field."
The future and destiny of any political party ultimately depends on the back and forth of the people.
"The heart is strength."
The number of members of our party is still a minority among the people.
The grand goals of our party cannot be achieved without the support of the people.
The level of governance and the effectiveness of our party's governance are not determined by itself, but must and can only be judged by the people.
The people are the supreme arbiter and final judge of our party's work.
If you claim to be wise, separate from the people, or stand above the people, you will definitely be abandoned by the people.
This is the case with any political party. This is the iron law of historical development, and there is no exception to this rule.
Independence is the inevitable conclusion of our party's revolution, construction and reform based on China's reality and relying on the strength of the party and the people.
Regardless of the past, present and future, we must put the development of the country and the nation on the basis of our own strength, uphold national self-esteem and self-confidence, and unswervingly follow our own path.
Independence is a fine tradition of the Chinese nation and an important principle for the founding of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China.
The national conditions and mission of carrying out revolution and construction in China, a big eastern country with a large population and backward economy and culture, determine that we can only go our own way.
Standing on the vast land of 9.6 million square kilometers, sucking the cultural nutrients accumulated by the Chinese nation's long-term struggle, and possessing the majestic power of the 1.3 billion Chinese people, we walk our own way and have an incomparably broad stage and an incomparably profound experience. Historical heritage, with an extremely strong forward determination.
The Chinese people should have this confidence, and every Chinese should have this confidence.
To insist on independence, we must insist that China's affairs must be advocated and handled by the Chinese people themselves.
There is no one-size-fits-all specific development model in the world, and no one-size-fits-all development path.
The diversity of historical conditions determines the diversity of development paths that countries choose.
In the history of humankind, no nation, no country can achieve strength and revitalization by relying on external forces and following others step by step.
The result of doing so is either inevitable failure or becoming a vassal of others.
In the long-term practice of leading the revolution, construction and reform, our party has always insisted on pioneering the way forward independently. This spirit of independent exploration and practice, and the firm confidence and determination to adhere to our own path are the foundation of all our party's theory and practice. The foothold is also the fundamental guarantee that the cause of the party and the people will continue to move from victory to victory.
To uphold independence, we must unswervingly follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, neither the old path of closure and rigidity, nor the evil path of changing the flag.
We must strengthen our political determination, and increase our self-confidence in the road, theory and system.
According to the development and changes of the situation and tasks, through comprehensively deepening reforms, we will continue to expand the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, continue to enrich the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and constantly improve the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
We must humbly learn from all the achievements of civilization created by human society.
To uphold independence, we must adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace and unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development.
We must hold high the banner of peace, development, cooperation and win-win, adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and live in friendship with other countries, actively carry out exchanges and cooperation with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and unswervingly safeguard world peace and promote common develop.
We must decide our own positions and policies according to the merits of the matter itself, uphold fairness, uphold justice, respect the right of the people of all countries to choose their own development paths, never impose our will on others, and never allow anyone to impose their own Will is imposed on the Chinese people.
We stand for the peaceful settlement of international disputes, oppose all forms of hegemonism and power politics, and never seek hegemony or expansion.
We must resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests. No foreign country should expect us to trade their core interests, and do not expect us to swallow the bitter fruit of harming our country's sovereignty, security, and development interests.
Achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese nation since modern times
(November 29, 2012)
The exhibition "Road to Rejuvenation" reviews the yesterday of the Chinese nation, shows the Chinese nation today, declares the future of the Chinese nation, and gives people profound education and inspiration.
Yesterday of the Chinese nation, it can be said that "Xiongguan Mandao is really like iron".
After modern times, the Chinese nation has suffered so much suffering and made great sacrifices that it is rare in world history.
However, the Chinese people never gave in, kept fighting, finally took control of their own destiny, started the great process of building their own country, and fully demonstrated the great national spirit with patriotism at the core.
The Chinese nation today can be described as "the right way in the world is vicissitudes of life".
Since the reform and opening up, we have summed up historical experience and continued arduous exploration, and finally found the right path to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and achieved remarkable results.
This path is socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The future of the Chinese nation can be said to be "there will be times when the wind and waves break through".
After more than 170 years of continuous struggle since the Opium War, the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has shown bright prospects.
Now, we are closer to the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than at any time in history, and we are more confident and capable of achieving this goal than at any time in history.
Looking back on the past, all comrades in the Party must bear in mind that if we fall behind, we will be beaten, and only by development can we become self-reliant.
Looking at the present, all comrades in the party must bear in mind that the road determines destiny, and how difficult it is to find a correct path, we must unswervingly go on.
Looking forward to the future, all comrades in the Party must keep in mind that there is still a long way to go before the blueprint can be turned into reality, and we will need to make long-term and arduous efforts.
Everyone has ideals and pursuits, as well as their own dreams.
Now, everyone is discussing the Chinese dream. I think that realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese nation in modern times.
This dream embodies the long-cherished wish of several generations of Chinese people, reflects the overall interests of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, and is the common expectation of every Chinese son and daughter.
History tells us that everyone's future and destiny are closely linked to the future and destiny of the country and the nation.
If the country is good and the nation is good, everyone will be good.
Achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is a glorious and arduous undertaking that requires the joint efforts of generations of Chinese people.
Empty talk misleads the country, hard work rejuvenates the country.
Our generation of Communists must build on the past and usher in the future, build our party well, unite all Chinese sons and daughters to build our country well, develop our nation well, and continue to forge ahead towards the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
I firmly believe that by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way will be realized, and by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the goal of building a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious will certainly be realized, and the dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will definitely be realized. can be realized.

Hard work can make dreams come true
(April 28, 2013)
We have set our goals for the future, which is to build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, to build a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious socialist modern country by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and strive to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. .
Although the road ahead is not smooth, and the tasks of reform, development and stability are still arduous and arduous, we are full of confidence to win in the future.
The working class of our country must play an exemplary and leading role in adhering to the Chinese path, promoting the Chinese spirit, and consolidating the strength of China, united as one, united as one, and make unremitting efforts to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
People create history, and labor creates the future.
Labor is the fundamental force that promotes the progress of human society.
Happiness does not fall from the sky, and dreams do not automatically come true.
To achieve our goals and create our bright future, we must rely closely on the people, always for the people, and must rely on hard work, honest work, and creative work.
We say that "empty talk will harm the country, and hard work will rejuvenate the country". To do hard work, we must first work on the ground.
On the journey to the future, we must give full play to the important role of our working class, revive their historical initiative, and mobilize the enthusiasm for labor and creativity.
First, we must give full play to the role of the main force of the working class.
The working class is my country's leading class, the representative of my country's advanced productive forces and production relations, the most solid and reliable class foundation of our party, and the main force for building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Since the reform and opening up, the ranks of the working class in our country have grown continuously, their quality has been improved in an all-round way, their structure has been optimized, their appearance has been completely renewed, and their advanced nature has been continuously enhanced.
Looking forward to the future, to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class, consolidate the leadership of the working class, and give full play to the role of the working class as the main force.
Wholeheartedly relying on the working class should not only be used as slogans and stickers, but must be implemented in the whole process of party and state policy formulation and work promotion, and in all aspects of enterprise production and operation.
Second, we must rely closely on the working class to develop socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics is the fundamental direction of contemporary China's development and progress, the only way to realize the Chinese dream, and the only way to lead the working class of our country to a brighter future.
The working class of our country must strengthen the sense of historical mission and responsibility, be based on their own duties, have the overall situation in mind, and consciously integrate the ideals of life and family happiness into the great cause of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, closely link personal dreams with the Chinese dream, and always take the country as the master. Attitude contributes to upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The working class of our country must firmly establish the ideal and belief of socialism with Chinese characteristics, firmly follow the party's belief, firmly support the socialist system, firmly support reform and opening up, and always be the pillar of adhering to the Chinese path; The great character of the working class in our country influences and drives the whole society with advanced ideas and exemplary actions, constantly injects new energy into the Chinese spirit, and always acts as a model to carry forward the Chinese spirit; The working class has a glorious tradition of understanding the general situation and considering the overall situation, consciously safeguarding the political situation of stability and unity, and has always been the backbone of China's strength.
Third, we must insist on advocating labor and benefiting workers.
Labor is the source of wealth and the source of happiness.
The beautiful dream in the world can only be realized through honest labor; all kinds of problems in development can only be solved through honest labor; all the brilliance in life can only be created through honest labor.
Labor has created the Chinese nation, created the glorious history of the Chinese nation, and will surely create a bright future for the Chinese nation.
"There is no difficulty in the world if you work hard."
We must firmly establish the concept of the most glorious labor, the most noble labor, the greatest labor, and the most beautiful labor, so that all the people can further develop their enthusiasm for labor, release their creative potential, and create a better life through labor.
The whole society must implement the major policy of respecting labor, knowledge, talents, and creativity, safeguarding and developing the interests of workers, and safeguarding their rights.
It is necessary to adhere to social fairness and justice, remove obstacles that hinder workers from participating in development and sharing the fruits of development, and strive to enable workers to achieve decent work and all-round development.
The whole society must love labor, be proud of hard work, and be ashamed of liking indolence and disliking it.
Fourth, we must vigorously promote the spirit of model workers and give full play to the role of model workers.
The power of example is infinite.
Model workers are national elites and role models for the people.
For a long time, the majority of model workers have created extraordinary achievements with ordinary labor, and created the spirit of model workers of "love and dedication, strive for first-class, hard work, innovation, indifference to fame and fortune, and dedication", which has enriched the national spirit and the spirit of the times. The connotation is our extremely precious spiritual wealth.
To achieve our development goals, we must not only become stronger materially, but also spiritually.
The people of all ethnic groups in the country should learn from the model workers, take the model workers as an example, give full play to the spirit of fighting for the day and night, and jointly devote themselves to the magnificent cause of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
The vast number of labor models and advanced figures should cherish the honor, make persistent efforts, be dedicated to their jobs, make selfless dedication, and be a model of firm ideals and beliefs, a model of hard work, and a model of promoting unity.
Contemporary workers must not only have strength, but also have wisdom and technology, be able to invent and innovate, and play the main theme of the times with practical actions.
Party committees, governments and trade union organizations at all levels must attach great importance to model workers, care for and care for model workers, support model workers to play a leading role, help model workers solve problems in production and life, and widely publicize the advanced deeds of model workers, so that the spirit of model workers continues to flourish.
The Party has high hopes for the trade union, and the workers and workers have high expectations for the trade union.
The Chinese trade union is a mass organization of the working class led by the Communist Party of China, a bridge and link between the party and the masses of workers, and an important social pillar of the socialist state power.
The development path of socialist trade unions with Chinese characteristics is an important part of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which profoundly reflects the nature and characteristics of Chinese trade unions, and is an important guarantee for trade union organizations and trade union work to always move in the right direction.
We must always adhere to this path, continue to expand this path, and strive to make this path wider and wider.
The times are developing, careers are innovating, and the work of trade unions must also develop and innovate.

The development prospects of our country are very bright, but the road cannot be smooth, the blueprint cannot be achieved overnight, and the dream cannot come true overnight.
All things in the world are hard.
The brighter the future, the more we need to work hard.
Only hard work can overcome difficulties, and hard work can make dreams come true.
We must vigorously promote the good fashion of hard work and hard work in the whole society.
Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in promoting the spirit of model workers, come up with practical strategies, encourage solid efforts, and do practical things, and do not seek false fame or vain merit, and resolutely oppose formalism, bureaucracy, hedonism, and extravagance that are strongly reflected by cadres and the masses. Wind", lead the masses to implement various tasks by example.
I am convinced that with the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the unity and progress of the working class and all working people in our country, and the common struggle of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will surely create a better future, and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will surely be realized. !
Unleash the dream of youth in the vivid practice of realizing the Chinese dream
(May 4, 2013)
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China drew a grand blueprint for building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and accelerating socialist modernization, and issued a call of the times to advance towards the realization of the "two centenary goals".
According to the spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we clearly propose to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Now, everyone is talking about the Chinese dream, thinking about the relationship between the Chinese dream and themselves, and their responsibilities for realizing the Chinese dream.
——The Chinese Dream is historical, realistic and future.
The Chinese Dream embodies the unremitting efforts of countless people with lofty ideals, carries the common aspiration of all Chinese sons and daughters, and shows the bright future of national prosperity, national rejuvenation and people's happiness.
——The Chinese dream belongs to the country, the nation, and every Chinese.
When the country is good and the nation is good, everyone will be good.
Only when everyone strives for a beautiful dream can we gather the majestic power to realize the Chinese dream.
——The Chinese dream is ours, and it is your younger generation.
The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will eventually become a reality in the relay struggle of the young people.
In the historical periods of revolution, construction and reform, the Communist Party of China has always attached great importance to, cared for, and trusted the youth, and placed ardent expectations on the younger generation.
The Communist Party of China has always regarded the youth as the future of the motherland and the hope of the nation. It has always regarded the youth as a new force in the development of the party and the people, and has always supported the youth in realizing their ideals in life in the great struggle of the people.
Now, we are closer to the goal of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than at any time in history, and we are more confident and capable of achieving this goal than at any time in history.
Barry is only half of 90.
The closer we are to the goal of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the more we must not slack off, the more we must redouble our efforts, and the more we must mobilize young people to fight for it.
Looking forward to the future, the young generation of our country will definitely have a bright future, and it will also make great achievements.
This is the historical law of "the back waves of the Yangtze River push the front waves", and it is also the youth responsibility of "one generation is stronger than the next".
The majority of young people should bravely shoulder the important tasks entrusted by the times, have high aspirations, be down-to-earth, and strive to release their youthful dreams in the vivid practice of the Chinese dream of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
First, the majority of young people must strengthen their ideals and beliefs.
"The merit is only the ambition, the industry is broad and the diligence."
Ideals guide the direction of life, and beliefs determine the success or failure of a career.
Without ideals and beliefs, it will lead to mental "calcium deficiency".
The Chinese Dream is the common ideal of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and it is also a lofty ideal that should be firmly established by the younger generation.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics is the correct path that our party has led the people to find to realize the Chinese dream through untold hardships, and it is also a life belief that the young people should firmly establish.
The majority of young people should insist on arming their minds with Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of the "Three Represents", and the Scientific Outlook on Development, and base their ideals and beliefs on a rational identification with scientific theories, on a correct understanding of historical laws, and on basic national conditions. In terms of accurate grasp of the Party, we should continuously increase our confidence in our road, theory, and system, strengthen our belief in upholding the Party's leadership, and always closely follow the Party and hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Second, the majority of young people must develop strong skills.
Learning is the ladder of growth and progress, and practice is the way to improve skills.
The quality and ability of young people directly affect the process of realizing the Chinese dream.
The ancients said: "Learning is like a bow and crossbow, talent is like an arrowhead."
It is said that the foundation of knowledge is like a bow and crossbow, and talent is like an arrow. As long as you rely on solid knowledge to guide you, you can make talent work well.
Young people are in the golden age of learning. They should take learning as their primary task, as a responsibility, a spiritual pursuit, and a way of life. They should establish the concept that their dreams begin with learning, and their careers are accomplished by their abilities, so that diligent learning can become a voyage of youth. The driving force, let the growth ability become the energy of youth fighting.
The majority of young people should insist on facing modernization, facing the world, and facing the future, enhancing the sense of urgency for knowledge update, eager to learn, not only solidly laying a solid foundation for basic knowledge but also updating knowledge in a timely manner, not only diligently studying theory but also actively mastering skills, and constantly improving with the development of the times and career Appropriate qualities and abilities are required.
We must persist in applying what we have learned, go deep into the grassroots and the masses, in the melting pot of reform and opening up and socialist modernization, in the big schools of society, master the true talents and practical learning, enhance what they cannot, and strive to become a useful and capable A pillar of responsibility.
Third, the majority of young people must have the courage to innovate and create.
Innovation is the soul of a nation's progress, the inexhaustible source of a country's prosperity, and the deepest national endowment of the Chinese nation.
Life never favors those who are conservative and satisfied with the status quo, never wait for those who are not enterprising and enjoy their achievements, but leave more opportunities to those who are good and innovative.
Young people are the most dynamic and creative group in society and should be at the forefront of innovation and creation.
The majority of young people must have the courage to be the first, have the courage to emancipate the mind, keep pace with the times, dare to seek up and down, forge ahead, and establish the ambition to surpass the predecessors on the basis of inheriting the predecessors. Country, nation of youth".
We must have the will to open a road when encountering mountains and build bridges when encountering rivers. We must be indomitable and courageous for innovation and creation.
We must have an attitude of exploring true knowledge, seeking truth and being pragmatic, and constantly accumulate experience and achieve results in innovation and creation based on our own job.
Fourth, the majority of young people must be determined to work hard.
"Bao Jianfeng comes from sharpening, and the fragrance of plum blossoms comes from bitter cold."
The beautiful ideals of human beings cannot be easily obtained, and they are inseparable from the hard work and hard work.
Our country, our nation, has grown from poverty and weakness step by step to today's development and prosperity, relying on the tenacious struggle of generations, relying on the Chinese nation's unremitting struggle for self-improvement.
At present, we are facing both important development opportunities and unprecedented difficulties and challenges.
The dream is ahead, the road is at the foot.
The one who wins is strong, and the one who is self-improving wins.
Achieving our development goals requires the perseverance and unremitting struggle of the young people.
The majority of young people should keep in mind that "empty talk will mislead the country, and hard work will rejuvenate the country", based on their own duties, immersed in hard work, starting from themselves, starting from bit by bit, and using hard-working hands and first-class performance to achieve their own wonderful life.
If you are not afraid of difficulties and overcome difficulties, you have the courage to go to the grassroots level with difficult conditions, the front line of national construction, and the frontier of project research, experience training and grow your talents.
We must have the courage to start a business, dare to forge ahead and work hard, strive to break new paths and innovate industries in the reform and opening up, and constantly open up new horizons for career development.
Fifth, the majority of young people must cultivate noble character.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics is socialism with all-round development of material and spiritual civilization.
A nation without spiritual strength cannot stand on its own, and a career without cultural support cannot last for a long time.
Youth is the social force that leads the trend.
The civilization quality of a nation is largely reflected in the moral level and spiritual outlook of the younger generation.
The majority of young people should closely combine correct moral cognition, conscious moral development, and positive moral practice, consciously establish and practice socialist core values, and take the lead in advocating a good social atmosphere.
It is necessary to strengthen ideological and moral cultivation, consciously promote patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, and actively advocate social morality, professional ethics, and family virtues.
It is necessary to keep in mind the principle of "from good to bad, from evil to collapse", and always maintain a positive attitude towards life, good moral quality, and a healthy taste for life.
It is necessary to advocate the new trend of social civilization, take the lead in learning from Lei Feng, actively participate in volunteer services, take the initiative to assume social responsibilities, sincerely care for others, do more practical things to help the poor, the weak and the disabled, and promote social progress with practical actions.
Struggle for the realization of the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the theme of the era of the Chinese youth movement.
The Communist Youth League will carry out in-depth education and practice activities on the theme of "My Chinese Dream" among the majority of young people, sowing dreams and igniting dreams for each young person, so that more young people dare to have dreams, dare to chase dreams, and diligently realize their dreams, so that every young person can have a dream. Add powerful youthful energy to the realization of the Chinese dream.
We must use the Chinese dream to lay a solid foundation for the common ideology of the young people, educate and help them establish a correct world outlook, outlook on life, and values, and always love our great motherland, our great people, and our great Chinese nation. Follow the party and take the Chinese road.
Use the Chinese Dream to inspire the youth's sense of historical responsibility, carry forward the glorious tradition of "the Party has the call and the League has the action", identify the entry point and integration point of their own work in the overall situation of the Party and the country, and organize and mobilize the majority of youth to support reform, Promote development and maintain stability.
It is necessary to actively provide services for the majority of young people to realize their dreams, effectively improve their work style, go to the grassroots level, enter the youth, think about what the youth think, worry about what the youth is anxious, represent and safeguard the general interests of the youth, and strive to create a good environment for the growth and success of the youth. surroundings.
Young role models are role models for the majority of young people to learn from, shoulder more social responsibilities and public expectations, and have a strong demonstration and leading role among young people and even the whole society.
It is hoped that the young models will make persistent efforts, be strict with themselves, forge ahead, and use their own growth process, spiritual pursuit and exemplary actions to set an example for the majority of young people.
When youth is prosperous, the country is prosperous, and when young people are strong, the country is strong.
Since the day our party was founded, it has always represented, won and relied on the vast majority of young people.
Party committees and governments at all levels must fully trust the youth, care about them with enthusiasm, and strictly demand the youth, so as to open up a wider sky for the youth to gallop their thoughts, build a broader stage for the youth to practice and innovate, provide the youth with richer opportunities to shape their lives, and provide the youth with more opportunities to shape their lives. Make achievements and create more favorable conditions.
Leading cadres at all levels should pay attention to the aspirations of young people, help them develop, support young people in their entrepreneurship, and be confidants of young friends and enthusiasts about youth work.
There is only one youth in a person's life.
Now, youth is for struggle; in the future, youth is for memory.
The road of life includes smooth roads and steep slopes, plains and dangerous shoals, straight roads and detours.
Young people face many choices. The key is to guide their choices with the correct world outlook, outlook on life and values.
The facts of countless successes in life show that in youth, if you choose to endure hardship, you choose to gain, and if you choose to sacrifice, you choose to be noble.
Experience a little more beatings, setbacks, and trials in youth, which is conducive to a good life.
It is necessary to experience the psychological quality of being intimidated by humiliation, strengthen the indomitable will to enterprising, maintain an optimistic and upward mental state, turn setbacks into motivation, and use the lessons learned from setbacks to inspire life, so that life can be sublimated and surpassed.
In short, only the youth that has made a passionate struggle, only the youth that has made a tenacious struggle, and only the youth that has made dedication to the people, will they leave full, warm, lasting, and regretless memories of youth.
I firmly believe that under the leadership of the party, as long as the people of all ethnic groups in the country are closely united, down-to-earth and forge ahead, by the middle of this century, we will surely build a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious. The people will witness and enjoy the realization of the Chinese dream together!
Realizing the Chinese Dream will not only benefit the Chinese people, but also the people of the world
(May 2013)
The Chinese nation has gone through hardships and has never given up its longing and pursuit of beautiful dreams.
Realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the long-cherished wish of the Chinese nation since modern times.
In the new historical period, the essence of the Chinese dream is the prosperity of the country, the rejuvenation of the nation, and the happiness of the people.
Our goal is to double the GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents from 2010 levels by 2020, and build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way.
By the middle of this century, we will build a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and harmonious, and realize the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
To realize the Chinese Dream, we must adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
We have been on this road for more than 30 years. History has proved that this is the right road that suits China's national conditions, enriches the people and strengthens the country. We will unswervingly follow this road.
Realizing Chinese Dream Must Carry Forward Chinese Spirit.
The national spirit with patriotism as the core and the spirit of the times with reform and innovation as the core inspire the "spirit" of the whole nation.
To realize the Chinese dream must gather the power of China.
Empty talk misleads the country, hard work rejuvenates the country.
We will use the wisdom and strength of the 1.3 billion Chinese people to make unremitting efforts from generation to generation to build our country well and develop our nation well.
To realize the Chinese dream, we must adhere to peaceful development.
We will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development and unswervingly pursue an opening-up strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results. We are not only committed to China's own development, but also stress our responsibilities and contributions to the world, not only for the benefit of the Chinese people, but also for the people of the world.
The realization of the Chinese Dream brings peace to the world, not turmoil; it is an opportunity, not a threat.
Although China and Latin America are separated by vast oceans, our hearts are connected.
What connects us is not only our deep traditional friendship and close ties of interests, but also our common pursuit of a beautiful dream.
In recent years, Latin American and Caribbean countries have continuously taken new steps for self-improvement through unity.
The establishment of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States fully demonstrates that Latin America is actively promoting the dream of unity, cooperation and common development advocated by the pioneers of the Latin American independence movement.
China is willing to work closely with Latin American and Caribbean countries, support each other, cooperate sincerely, and join hands on the road to the beautiful dream of development and prosperity.
Innovation is at the right time, and the realization of dreams is in place
(21 October 2013)
Building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, advancing socialist modernization, and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation are glorious and great undertakings and bright and splendid prospects.
All who are interested in this great cause can make a difference.
On the great journey of hundreds of millions of Chinese people, it is the right time for the vast number of overseas students to innovate and realize their dreams.
The vast number of students studying abroad should unite their patriotism, the ambition to strengthen the country, and the trip to serve the country, integrate their dreams into the people's magnificent struggle to realize the Chinese dream, and write their names in the glorious history of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Here, I have 4 points of hope for the majority of overseas students.
First, I hope everyone will stick to the spirit of patriotism.
In the long history of thousands of years of development of the Chinese nation, patriotism has always been the main theme of passion, and it has always been a powerful force that inspires the people of all ethnic groups in our country to strive for self-improvement.
No matter how long the shadow of the tree is, the root will always be rooted in the soil; no matter where the overseas students are, they must always keep the motherland and the people in their hearts.
Comrade Qian Xuesen once said: "As a Chinese scientific and technological worker, the purpose of my life is to serve the people.
If the people are finally satisfied with the work I have done in my life, that is the highest reward. "
It is hoped that the vast number of overseas students will inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of studying abroad to serve the country, be the adherents and disseminators of patriotism, uphold the life ideal of "the world's worries and worries, and the world's joy and happiness", and always make the country prosperous and strong and the nation rejuvenated. , People's happiness as the aspiration, consciously make the fruits of personal success bear on the evergreen tree of patriotism.
The party and the state respect the choice of the majority of students studying abroad. We welcome them with open arms when they return to work in China. If they stay overseas, we support serving the country in various ways.
Everyone should keep in mind that no matter where you are, you are all part of the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. The motherland and people will always miss you, and the motherland will always be your warm spiritual home.
Second, I hope everyone is determined to study hard.
Learning is the eternal theme of being a human being, and it is also an important foundation for serving the country and the people.
Dreams start with learning, and careers start with practice.
In today's world, knowledge and information are updated rapidly, and if you slack off in learning, you will fall behind.
Some people say that everyone's world is a circle, and learning is a radius. The larger the radius, the wider the world you have.
It is hoped that the vast number of overseas students will continue to face modernization, the world, and the future, aiming at international advanced knowledge, technology, and management experience, and strive to expand knowledge with the perseverance of Weiwei's three masterpieces, the perseverance of hanging beams and thorns, and the energy of digging walls and borrowing light, and catching fire and reflecting snow. Radius, read both books with words and books without words, improve moral quality, master true talents and practical learning, and cultivate excellent skills.
Students studying abroad who have completed their studies should also broaden their horizons and vision, speed up knowledge update, optimize knowledge structure, and strive to become outstanding talents who can be worthy of great responsibilities and can do great things.
Third, I hope everyone will work hard to innovate and create.
Innovation is the soul of a nation's progress, the inexhaustible driving force for a country's prosperity, and the deepest national endowment of the Chinese nation.
In the fierce international competition, only innovators advance, only innovators are strong, and only innovators win.
Students studying abroad have a broad vision and should be at the forefront of innovation.
The fiery process of the motherland's reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive has provided a broad stage for all those who are interested in innovation, creation, and careers.
It is hoped that the majority of overseas students will actively participate in innovation and creation practice, have the courage to dare to be the first, have the perseverance to search from top to bottom, and strive to achieve breakthroughs, development and achievements.
On the land of China, if you want to make achievements and achievements, the key is to stand on the ground of the motherland, hold the people's expectations in mind, find the combination of professional advantages and social development, and find the combination of advanced knowledge and our country's reality. , and truly make innovation and creation take root and bear fruit.
Fourth, I hope you will actively promote foreign exchanges.
China's development is inseparable from the world, and the world's prosperity also needs China.
With a more open attitude, we should strengthen our ties and interactions with the world, and deepen our understanding and friendship with people of all countries.
The vast number of overseas students have both domestic growth experience and overseas life experience, both extensive domestic and foreign interpersonal relationships and rich experience in different cultural exchanges. Many foreigners understand China and China through you, and many Chinese understand the world through you. Know the world.
It is hoped that the vast number of overseas students will give full play to their own advantages, strengthen internal and external connections, build bridges, and be good non-governmental ambassadors to promote friendly exchanges between China and foreign countries. Spread the voice of China well, and let the world have more understanding and support for China.
The European and American Alumni Association was established 100 years ago when the nation was in crisis. Since its establishment, it has actively practiced patriotism, organized members to participate in the patriotic democratic movement, devote themselves to the cause of national salvation and people's liberation, and became a patriotic association that pursued democracy and advocated science in that era.
After the founding of New China, the European and American Alumni Association actively mobilized overseas scholars to return to China and became a progressive society under the leadership of the party and the government.
Since the reform and opening up, the European and American Alumni Association has vigorously implemented the "Serving the Country Plan" and has become a mass organization dedicated to the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
In 2003, with the approval of the central government, the European and American Alumni Association increased the name of the "Chinese Overseas Students Association", expanded its work field to the whole country, and expanded its work objects to the world, becoming a people's organization with wider influence.
Facing the new situation and new tasks, the European and American Alumni Association and the Chinese Overseas Students Association should give full play to the characteristics and advantages of mass, high intelligence and united front, based on the domestic and overseas development, and strive to become a talent pool for studying abroad and serving the country, and a think tank that offers advice and suggestions. , A new force to carry out non-governmental diplomacy, become the bridge link between the party and the vast number of overseas students, the party and the government's assistants in the work of overseas students, the home of the vast number of overseas students, and closely unite the vast number of overseas students around the party.
It is necessary to care about the work, study and life of overseas students, reflect their wishes and demands, safeguard their legitimate rights and interests, and continuously enhance their attractiveness and cohesion.
"The virtuous is the foundation of government."
Party committees and governments at all levels must conscientiously implement the Party and the state's policies on the work of overseas students, and cultivate on a larger scale and more effectively the talents of all levels and types that are urgently needed for my country's reform, opening up and socialist modernization drive.
If the environment is good, the talents will gather and the career will flourish; if the environment is not good, the talents will be scattered and the career will decline.
It is necessary to improve the working mechanism, enhance the awareness of service, strengthen education and guidance, build an innovative platform, be good at discovering talents, unite talents, and use talents, create a good environment for overseas students to return to work and serve the country, and promote outstanding talents to stand out.
It is necessary to care and support the work of the European and American Alumni Association and the Chinese Overseas Students Association, strengthen organizational construction, improve the working organization, and strengthen the working force to create conditions for them to carry out their work.
A developing China needs more overseas talents, and an open China welcomes talents from all over the world.
We believe that as long as the majority of overseas students keep in mind that "empty talk will mislead the country, and hard work will rejuvenate the country", stand with the people and struggle with the people, they will surely be able to write a Chinese dream worthy of the times and worthy of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The people, worthy of a splendid chapter of history!
Achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the common dream of Chinese sons and daughters at home and abroad
(June 6, 2014)
A united Chinese nation is the common root of the Chinese people at home and abroad, the broad and profound Chinese culture is the common soul of the Chinese people at home and abroad, and the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the common dream of the Chinese people at home and abroad.
The common roots make us feel deeply, the common soul makes us stick to each other, and the common dream makes us unite. We will surely be able to jointly write a new chapter in the development of the Chinese nation.
When I saw my fellow villagers, my eyes were full of tears, and I felt very cordial to see everyone.
On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to the convening of the 7th World Association of Overseas Chinese Associations, a warm welcome to the overseas Chinese and friends attending the meeting, and sincere greetings to overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese all over the world.
There are tens of millions of overseas Chinese all over the world, and all of them are members of the big Chinese family.
For a long time, generations of overseas Chinese have been adhering to the excellent traditions of the Chinese nation, not forgetting the motherland, not forgetting their ancestral home, and not forgetting the blood of the Chinese nation flowing in their bodies. It has made important contributions to the great cause of peaceful reunification and the promotion of friendly cooperation between the Chinese people and peoples of other countries.
The people of the motherland will always remember the achievements of the vast number of overseas Chinese.
At present, the Chinese people are striving for the realization of the "two centenary goals" and the realization of the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
In this great process, the vast number of overseas Chinese will certainly be able to play an irreplaceable and important role.
The Chinese dream is a national dream, a national dream, and the dream of every Chinese son and daughter.
The vast number of overseas Chinese have ardent patriotism, strong economic strength, rich intellectual resources, and extensive business contacts, which are an important force for realizing the Chinese dream.
As long as the Chinese sons and daughters at home and abroad unite closely, contribute forcefully, be wise, and work together as one, we will surely be able to gather together a powerful force to realize our dreams.
Chinese civilization has a long history of more than 5,000 years, and it is a powerful spiritual force for the Chinese nation to continuously improve itself and grow stronger.
No matter where our compatriots live, they all have a distinct imprint of Chinese culture on them. Chinese culture is the spiritual gene shared by all Chinese sons and daughters.
I hope that everyone will continue to carry forward Chinese culture, not only to draw spiritual strength from it, but also to actively promote exchanges and mutual learning between Chinese and foreign civilizations, tell Chinese stories, spread Chinese voices, promote mutual understanding and understanding between Chinese and foreign people, and create a good environment for the realization of the Chinese dream. .
The Chinese Dream is not only the dream of the Chinese people to pursue happiness, but also the dream of the people of other countries in pursuit of happiness.
When the country is good and the nation is good, everyone will be good.
If the world is good, China will be good.
China adheres to the path of peaceful development and is a positive force for the prosperity and development of the world.
The vast number of overseas Chinese should use their own advantages and conditions to actively bridge the exchanges and cooperation between the country where they live and China in various fields, better integrate into and give back to the local society, and continue to make new contributions to the promotion of world peace and development.
Reform and opening up is only in progress but not completed
(December 31, 2012)
Reform and opening up is a long-term, arduous and arduous undertaking that must be carried on from generation to generation.
We must adhere to the reform direction of the socialist market economy, adhere to the basic national policy of opening to the outside world, and with greater political courage and wisdom, seize the opportunity to deepen reform in important areas, and move forward bravely in the direction of reform and opening up guided by the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
History, reality and future are interlinked.
History is the reality of the past, and reality is the history of the future.
In order to implement the major plans for reform and opening up established by the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we must seriously review and thoroughly summarize the history of reform and opening up, have a deeper understanding of the historical inevitability of reform and opening up, more consciously grasp the regularity of reform and opening up, and be more determined. To shoulder the major responsibility of deepening reform and opening up.
We must conscientiously summarize and apply the successful experience of reform and opening up.
First, reform and opening up is a profound revolution, and we must stick to the right direction and advance along the right path.
On the issue of direction, we must be very clear-headed, constantly promote the self-improvement and development of the socialist system, and unswervingly follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Second, reform and opening up is a brand-new undertaking that has never been seen before. We must adhere to the correct methodology and advance through continuous practice and exploration.
Crossing the river by feeling the stones is a reform method with Chinese characteristics and in line with China's national conditions.
To cross the river by feeling the stones is to feel the law and gain true knowledge from practice.
Crossing the river by feeling the stones and strengthening the top-level design are dialectical and unified. The promotion of partial phased reform and opening up should be carried out on the premise of strengthening the top-level design, and the strengthening of the top-level design should be planned on the basis of promoting the partial phased reform and opening up.
It is necessary to strengthen macro-thinking and top-level design, pay more attention to the systematization, integrity, and synergy of reform, and at the same time, continue to encourage bold experiments and breakthroughs, and continue to deepen reform and opening up.
Third, reform and opening up is a systematic project, and we must adhere to comprehensive reforms and advance them in coordination with various reforms.
Reform and opening up is a profound and comprehensive social change. Each reform will have an important impact on other reforms, and each reform requires the coordination and cooperation of other reforms.
It is necessary to pay more attention to the mutual promotion and positive interaction of various reforms, promote the overall progress, and make breakthroughs in key points, so as to form a strong synergy to promote reform and opening up.
Fourth, stability is the prerequisite for reform and development, and we must adhere to the unity of reform, development and stability.
Only with social stability can reform and development continue to advance; only with continuous advancement of reform and development can social stability have a solid foundation.
We must insist on unifying the intensity of reform, the speed of development and the level of social affordability, and take improving people's lives as the joint point in correctly handling the relationship between reform, development and stability.
Fifth, reform and opening up is the cause of hundreds of millions of people themselves. We must adhere to respecting the people's pioneering spirit and insist on advancing under the leadership of the Party.
Every breakthrough and development in the understanding and practice of reform and opening up, the emergence and development of every new thing in reform and opening up, the creation and accumulation of experience in every aspect of reform and opening up, all come from the practice and wisdom of hundreds of millions of people.
The more arduous the task of reform, development and stability is, the more we must strengthen and improve the party's leadership, the more we must maintain the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the people, be good at leading the people forward by proposing and implementing correct lines, principles and policies, and be good at creating and developing from the people's practice It is necessary to improve policies and propositions in the requirements, so that the achievements of reform and development will benefit all the people more and more equitably, and continuously consolidate the mass foundation for deepening reform and opening up.
The reform and opening up can only be carried out when it is not completed.
Without reform and opening up, China would not be where it is today, and there would be no China tomorrow.
The contradictions in the reform and opening up can only be solved by the method of reform and opening up.
We must fully implement the spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, adhere to the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of "Three Represents", and the Scientific Outlook on Development, actively respond to the strong voices and ardent expectations of the broad masses of the people for deepening reform and opening up, and build social consensus. Coordinate and promote reforms in all fields and links, and strive to push reform and opening up forward.
Explanation on the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening the Reform"
(November 9, 2013)
Entrusted by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, I will now explain to the plenary session the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening the Reform".
I. About the drafting process of the plenary decision
Since the reform and opening up, what topics were studied, what decisions were made, what measures were taken, and what signals were released at the Third Plenary Sessions of the Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee. Years of work are of great significance.
After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee began to consider the topics of the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China put forward the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and deepening reform and opening up in an all-round way, emphasizing that we must use greater political courage and wisdom to seize the opportunity to deepen reforms in important areas, and resolutely eliminate all ideological and institutional drawbacks that hinder scientific development. , to build a system that is complete, scientific and standardized, and operates effectively, so that all aspects of the system are more mature and finalized.
We believe that in order to complete the strategic goals and work arrangements proposed at the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we must press ahead with comprehensive reforms.
It has been 35 years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made the historic decision to shift the work center of the Party and the state to economic construction and implement reform and opening up.
The face of the Chinese people, the face of socialist China, and the face of the Communist Party of China can undergo such profound changes, and my country can win a pivotal position in the international community, relying on the unremitting promotion of reform and opening up.
In 1992, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in the southern talk: "If you don't adhere to socialism, if you don't reform and open up, if you don't develop the economy, if you don't improve the people's life, you will only be a dead end."
Looking back, we have a deeper understanding of what Comrade Deng Xiaoping said.
Therefore, we say that only socialism can save China, and only reform and opening up can develop China, develop socialism, and develop Marxism.
It is precisely from the perspective of historical experience and practical needs that since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee has repeatedly emphasized that reform and opening up is the key move to determine the fate of contemporary China, and it is also a decision to achieve the "two centenary goals" and the realization of the Chinese nation. The key to the great rejuvenation is that the development of practice will never end, the emancipation of the mind will never end, and the reform and opening up will never end. There is no way out for stagnation and retrogression.
In the face of the new situation and new tasks, we must comprehensively deepen reforms, focus on solving a series of prominent contradictions and problems faced by our country's development, and continuously promote the self-improvement and development of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics.
At present, the domestic and international environment is undergoing extremely extensive and profound changes. my country's development faces a series of prominent contradictions and challenges, and there are still many difficulties and problems on the way forward.
For example, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable problems in development are still prominent, technological innovation capabilities are not strong, industrial structure is unreasonable, development methods are still extensive, the development gap between urban and rural areas and the income distribution gap between residents is still large, and social conflicts have increased significantly. Education, employment, social security, medical care, housing, ecological environment, food and drug safety, safety in production, social security, law enforcement and justice, etc. have many issues that concern the vital interests of the masses. The problem of extravagance is prominent, negative corruption is prone to occur frequently in some areas, the fight against corruption is still grim, and so on.
To solve these problems, the key lies in deepening reforms.
In April of this year, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee decided to study and make a decision on comprehensively deepening the reform at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee after in-depth thinking and research, as well as extensive listening to the opinions of all parties inside and outside the party.
On April 20, the Central Committee issued the "Notice on soliciting opinions on the issue of comprehensively deepening the reform at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee".
All regions and departments agreed that the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee focused on the issue of comprehensively deepening the reform, which complied with the wishes of the majority of Party members, cadres, and the masses, and grasped the issues of greatest concern to the whole society.
Since the reform and opening up, the Third Plenary Sessions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have studied and discussed the issue of deepening reform, all of which are sending an important signal that our party will unswervingly hold high the banner of reform and opening up, and unswervingly adhere to the theory since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party. and route policy.
In the final analysis, it is to answer the question of what flag to raise and what road to take under the new historical conditions.
The Third Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China took comprehensively deepening reform as the main topic. It is our party's adherence to Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of "Three Represents", and the Scientific Outlook on Development as the guide to unswervingly implement the party's basic line in the new situation. , basic program, basic experience, basic requirements, an important declaration and important manifestation of unswervingly holding high the banner of reform and opening up.
After the topic was determined, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee decided to set up a document drafting team, with me as the team leader, Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli as the deputy team leaders, responsible comrades from relevant departments, and some provincial and municipal leaders to participate, under the leadership of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. The plenary decides on the drafting work.
Since the establishment of the document drafting group, for nearly 7 months, it has widely solicited opinions, carried out special demonstrations, conducted investigations and researches, and repeatedly discussed and revised.
During this period, three meetings of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and two meetings of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee respectively deliberated and decided, and the draft was also distributed to a certain range of the party for comments, soliciting the opinions of old comrades in the party, and specifically listening to the Central Committee of the democratic parties and the whole country. The heads of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the opinions of non-partisan persons.
Judging from the feedback, all parties agreed that the decision of the plenary session deeply analyzed the major theoretical and practical problems facing my country's reform, development and stability, clarified the significance and future direction of comprehensively deepening the reform, and put forward the guiding ideology, goals and tasks for comprehensively deepening the reform. , major principles, depicting a new blueprint, new vision, and new goals for comprehensively deepening reforms, bringing together new ideas, new judgments, and new measures for comprehensively deepening reforms, reflecting social voices, social demands, and social expectations. The ideological consensus and action wisdom of the whole society on comprehensively deepening the reform.
All parties agreed that the decision of the plenary session rationally laid out the strategic priorities, priorities, main directions, working mechanisms, promotion methods, timetables, and roadmaps for comprehensively deepening the reform, and formed a series of new major breakthroughs in reform theories and policies. Another general deployment and general mobilization of comprehensively deepening the reform will definitely have a significant and far-reaching impact on promoting the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
During the process of soliciting opinions, many good opinions and suggestions were put forward.
The Central Committee instructed the document drafting group to carefully sort out and study these opinions and suggestions, and the document drafting group made important revisions to the decision of the plenary session.
2. The overall framework and key issues for the decision of the plenary session
The Political Bureau of the Central Committee believes that in the face of the new situation, new tasks and new requirements, the key to comprehensively deepening reforms is to further form a development environment for fair competition, further enhance the vitality of economic and social development, further improve government efficiency and effectiveness, and further realize social fairness and justice. Promote social harmony and stability, and further improve the party's leadership and governance capacity.
Focusing on these major topics, we emphasize that we must have a strong awareness of problems, take major problems as the guide, grasp key issues for further research and thinking, and strive to solve a series of prominent contradictions and problems facing my country's development.
We Chinese Communists have always done revolution, construction, and reform to solve China's real problems.
It can be said that the reform was forced by the problem and deepened in the continuous solution of the problem.
Over the past 35 years, we have solved a series of problems in the development of the party and the country through reform.
At the same time, in the process of understanding and transforming the world, old problems are solved, new problems will arise, and the system always needs to be continuously improved. Therefore, reform cannot be accomplished overnight or once and for all.
The plenary meeting decided to draft, highlighting five aspects of consideration.
The first is to adapt to the new requirements of the development of the party and the country, and implement the strategic task of comprehensively deepening reform and opening up put forward by the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
The second is to take the reform as the main line and highlight the new measures for comprehensively deepening the reform. General measures, repetitive measures, and purely developmental measures are not included.
The third is to grasp the key points, focus on solving the problems strongly reflected by the people, respond to the voices and expectations of the people, highlight important areas and key links, and highlight the leading role of economic system reform.
The fourth is to insist on being active and prudent, and to design reform measures with boldness and steady steps.
The fifth is to design the time to 2020, propose reform tasks according to this time period, and achieve decisive results in the reform of important areas and key links by 2020.
In terms of frame structure, the plenary meeting decided to take the major issues that need to be solved urgently as the main points, and plan the layout according to the rules.
In addition to the introduction and conclusion, there are 16 parts in total, divided into three major sections.
The first part constitutes the first section, which is the general theory, which mainly expounds the significance, guiding ideology and general thinking of comprehensively deepening the reform.
Parts 2 to 15 constitute the second section, which is a sub-thesis, mainly from the six aspects of economy, politics, culture, society, ecological civilization, national defense and the army, and specifically deploys the main tasks and major measures for comprehensively deepening the reform.
Among them, there are 6 articles in the economic aspect (Parts 2 to 7), 3 articles in the political aspect (Parts 8 through 10), 1 article in the cultural aspect (Part 11), and 2 articles in the social aspect (Part 10). Sections 12 to 13), 1 article on ecology (section 14), and 1 article on national defense and the military (section 15).
The sixteenth part constitutes the third section, which is about organization and leadership, mainly expounding on strengthening and improving the Party's leadership in comprehensively deepening the reform.
Here, I would like to introduce the central government's consideration on several major issues and major measures involved in the decision of the plenary session.
First, it is about making the market play a decisive role in resource allocation and better playing the role of the government.
This is a major theoretical point raised by the decision of this plenary meeting.
This is because the reform of the economic system is still the focus of comprehensively deepening the reform, and the core issue of the reform of the economic system is still to properly handle the relationship between the government and the market.
In 1992, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed that the goal of my country's economic system reform is to establish a socialist market economic system, and proposed that the market should play a fundamental role in resource allocation under the state's macro-control.
This major theoretical breakthrough has played an extremely important role in my country's reform and opening up and economic and social development.
This also shows that theoretical innovation plays an important leading role in practical innovation, and the comprehensive deepening of reform must be guided by theoretical innovation.
After more than 20 years of practice, my country's socialist market economic system has been initially established, but there are still many problems, mainly because the market order is not standardized, and the phenomenon of seeking economic benefits by illegal means is widespread; the development of the production factor market is lagging behind, and the factors are idle and A large number of effective demands are not met and coexist; market rules are not uniform, sectoral protectionism and local protectionism exist in large numbers; market competition is insufficient, which hinders the survival of the fittest and structural adjustment, and so on.
If these problems are not solved well, it will be difficult to form a perfect socialist market economic system.
In the more than 20 years since the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we have been looking for a new scientific orientation based on practical expansion and deepening understanding of the relationship between the government and the market.
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to "make the market play a fundamental role in resource allocation under the state's macro-control", and the 16th National Congress of the Party proposed to "give full play to the fundamental role of the market in resource allocation to a greater extent". The Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to "better play the fundamental role of the market in resource allocation from an institutional perspective", and the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to "give full play to the fundamental role of the market in resource allocation to a greater extent and a wider range".
It can be seen that our understanding of the relationship between the government and the market is also deepening.
In the course of this discussion and soliciting opinions, many parties suggested that the relationship between the government and the market should be further positioned in theory, which will play a very important role in comprehensively deepening the reform.
Considering various opinions and practical development requirements, after repeated discussions and studies, the central government believes that the conditions for making a new theoretical statement on this issue are ripe, and the "basic role" of the market in resource allocation should be changed to "decisive role" .
At present, my country's socialist market economic system has been initially established, the degree of marketization has been greatly improved, our understanding and control of market laws have been continuously improved, the macro-control system has become more complete, and the subjective and objective conditions are in place. We should improve the socialist market. New steps have been taken in the economic system.
To further handle the relationship between the government and the market, in fact, it is necessary to handle the issue of whether the market plays a decisive role or the government plays a decisive role in resource allocation.
Economic development is to improve the allocation efficiency of resources, especially scarce resources, to produce as many products as possible with as few resources as possible, and to obtain the greatest possible benefits.
Both theory and practice have proved that market allocation of resources is the most efficient form.
The market determines the allocation of resources is a general law of the market economy, and the market economy is essentially an economy in which the market determines the allocation of resources.
To improve the socialist market economic system, we must follow this rule and focus on solving the problems of imperfect market system, excessive government intervention and inadequate supervision.
The positioning of "making the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources" is conducive to establishing a correct concept of the relationship between the government and the market in the whole party and the whole society, and is conducive to the transformation of the economic development mode, the transformation of government functions, and the suppression of passive corruption. Phenomenon.
Of course, our country implements a socialist market economy system, and we must still insist on giving full play to the superiority of our socialist system and the positive role of the party and government.
The market plays a decisive role in resource allocation, but not all.
To develop a socialist market economy, both the role of the market and the role of the government should be brought into play, but the functions of the market and the government are different.
The decision of the plenary session put forward clear requirements for better exerting the role of the government, emphasizing that scientific macro-control and effective government governance are inherent requirements for giving full play to the advantages of the socialist market economy system.
The Plenary Session decided to make arrangements to improve the macro-control system, fully and correctly perform government functions, and optimize the organizational structure of the government, emphasizing that the government's responsibilities and roles are mainly to maintain macroeconomic stability, strengthen and optimize public services, ensure fair competition, strengthen market supervision, and maintain market order, promote sustainable development, promote common prosperity, and make up for market failures.
The second is about upholding and improving the basic economic system.
Adhering to and improving the basic economic system in which public ownership is the mainstay and multiple forms of ownership develop together is an important pillar for consolidating and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics.
Since the reform and opening up, my country's ownership structure has been gradually adjusted, and the proportions of the public and non-public economies in economic development and employment promotion have been constantly changing, enhancing the vitality of economic and social development.
Under such circumstances, how to better reflect and adhere to the dominant position of public ownership, and how to further explore the effective realization of the basic economic system, is a major issue before us.
The decision of the plenary meeting emphasized the need to unswervingly consolidate and develop the public sector of the economy, adhere to the dominant position of the public sector, give play to the leading role of the state-owned economy, and continuously enhance the vitality, control and influence of the state-owned economy.
The plenary session decided to adhere to and develop the relevant discussions since the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, proposed to actively develop the mixed-ownership economy, and emphasized that the mixed-ownership economy with cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned capital, collective capital, and non-public capital is an important part of the basic economic system. The form of realization is conducive to the amplification of functions of state-owned capital, the preservation and appreciation of value, and the improvement of competitiveness.
This is an effective way and an inevitable choice to uphold the dominant status of public ownership and enhance the vitality, control and influence of the state-owned economy under the new situation.
The plenary meeting decided to improve the state-owned assets management system, focus on capital management, strengthen state-owned asset supervision, and reform the authorized operation system of state-owned capital; the investment and operation of state-owned capital should serve the national strategic goals, and invest more in important matters related to national security and the lifeline of the national economy. Industries and key areas, focusing on providing public services, developing important and forward-looking strategic industries, protecting the ecological environment, supporting scientific and technological progress, and safeguarding national security; transferring part of state-owned capital to enrich social security funds; increasing the proportion of state-owned capital income turned over to public finance, and more. It is mostly used to protect and improve people's livelihood.
State-owned enterprises are an important force in promoting the modernization of the country and safeguarding the common interests of the people.
After years of reform, state-owned enterprises have generally been integrated with the market economy.
At the same time, state-owned enterprises have accumulated some problems and drawbacks, and further reforms are needed.
The plenary session decided to propose a series of targeted reform measures, including increasing the investment of state-owned capital in public welfare enterprises; the natural monopoly industries where state-owned capital continues to control and operate, implement the separation of government and enterprise, separation of government and capital, franchising, and government supervision. The main content of the reform is to separate network operations and open up competitive businesses according to the characteristics of different industries; improve the corporate governance structure of coordinated operation and effective checks and balances; establish a professional manager system to better play the role of entrepreneurs; establish long-term incentives and constraints Mechanism, strengthen the accountability of state-owned enterprises for operation and investment; explore and promote the disclosure of major information such as financial budgets of state-owned enterprises; state-owned enterprises should reasonably increase the proportion of market-based selection and employment, and reasonably determine and strictly regulate the salary level, job treatment, job consumption, business consumption.
These measures will promote state-owned enterprises to improve the modern enterprise system, improve operational efficiency, reasonably assume social responsibilities, and play a better role.
Adhering to and improving the basic economic system must adhere to the "two unshakable".
The plenary meeting decided to put forward reform measures to encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public economy and stimulate the vitality and creativity of the non-public economy from multiple levels.
In terms of functional positioning, it is clear that both the public economy and the non-public economy are an important part of the socialist market economy and an important basis for my country's economic and social development; in terms of property rights protection, it is clearly stated that the property rights of the public economy are inviolable, and the non-public economy property rights are inviolable. It is also inviolable; in terms of policy treatment, it emphasizes adherence to equal rights, equal opportunities, and equal rules, and implements a unified market access system; encourages non-public enterprises to participate in the reform of state-owned enterprises, encourages the development of mixed-ownership enterprises controlled by non-public capital, and encourages non-public enterprises to participate in the reform of state-owned enterprises. conditions for private enterprises to establish a modern enterprise system.
This will promote the healthy development of the non-public economy.
Third, on deepening the reform of the fiscal and taxation system.
Finance is the foundation and important pillar of national governance, and a scientific fiscal and taxation system is the institutional guarantee for optimizing resource allocation, maintaining market unity, promoting social fairness, and achieving long-term national stability.
The current fiscal and taxation system was gradually perfected and formed on the basis of the tax-sharing system reform in 1994, and has played an important role in realizing the win-win goal of increasing government financial resources and rapid economic development.
As the situation develops and changes, the current fiscal and taxation system has not fully adapted to the objective requirements of rationally dividing central and local powers and improving national governance, nor fully adapted to the practical needs of changing the mode of economic development and promoting sustainable and healthy economic and social development. Some of the outstanding contradictions and problems in the government are also related to the imperfect fiscal and taxation system.
The reform of the fiscal and taxation system is one of the priorities in this comprehensive deepening of reform.
It mainly involves improving the budget management system, improving the taxation system, and establishing a system that matches the powers and expenditure responsibilities.
The plenary meeting decided to implement a comprehensive, standardized, open and transparent budget system, appropriately strengthen the central authority and expenditure responsibilities, and take national defense, foreign affairs, national security, and national unified market rules and management as the central authority; some social security, cross-regional major projects Construction and maintenance are the common powers of the central and local governments, and gradually straighten out the relationship between powers and powers; the central government can entrust some of the powers and expenditures to local governments by arranging transfer payments; for public services that cross regions and have a greater impact on other regions, the central government undertakes the responsibility through transfer payments Part of the local authority expenditure responsibility.
The main purpose of these reform measures is to clarify powers, reform the tax system, stabilize tax burden, transparent budget, improve efficiency, and speed up the formation of a modern fiscal system that is conducive to the transformation of economic development mode, the establishment of a fair and unified market, and the promotion of equalization of basic public services. To form a fiscal and taxation system that matches the financial resources and powers of the central and local governments, and give better play to the enthusiasm of the central and local governments.
The reform of the fiscal and taxation system requires a process that will be gradually implemented.
The central government has made it clear that it is necessary to maintain the overall stability of the existing central and local financial resources, and to further rationalize the division of central and local revenue.
Fourth, on improving the integrated system and mechanism of urban and rural development.
Unbalanced and uncoordinated urban and rural development is a prominent contradiction in my country's economic and social development, and a major problem that must be solved in building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and accelerating socialist modernization.
Since the reform and opening up, my country's rural landscape has undergone earth-shaking changes.
However, the urban-rural dual structure has not fundamentally changed, and the trend of the growing gap between urban and rural development has not fundamentally reversed.
To fundamentally solve these problems, we must promote the integration of urban and rural development.
The Plenary Session decided that it is necessary to improve the system and mechanism, to form a new type of industrial-agricultural-urban-rural relationship that promotes agriculture through industry, urban and rural areas, mutual benefits between industry and agriculture, and integration of urban and rural areas, so that farmers can equally participate in the modernization process and share the fruits of modernization.
The plenary meeting decided to put forward reform measures to improve the integrated system and mechanism of urban and rural development.
The first is to accelerate the construction of a new agricultural management system.
The main purpose is to adhere to the basic position of family management in agriculture, encourage the transfer of land contract management rights to large professional households, family farms, farmers' cooperatives, and agricultural enterprises in the open market, encourage the development of cooperative economy in rural areas, and encourage and guide industrial and commercial capital to develop in rural areas. The modern planting and breeding industry, which is suitable for enterprise-oriented management, allows farmers to use the land contract management rights to invest in the development of agricultural industrialized management.
The second is to give farmers more property rights.
The main purpose is to safeguard farmers' right to contract and manage land in accordance with the law, protect the rights of members of farmers' collective economic organizations, protect farmers' usufructuary rights on their homesteads, and prudently and prudently promote the pilot program of mortgage, guarantee, and transfer of farmers' housing property rights.
The third is to promote the equal exchange of urban and rural factors and the balanced allocation of public resources.
Mainly to ensure equal pay for equal work for migrant workers and ensure that farmers share the land value-added income fairly; improve the agricultural insurance system; encourage social capital to invest in rural construction, and allow enterprises and social organizations to set up various undertakings in rural areas; coordinate the balanced allocation of urban and rural compulsory education resources, and integrate urban and rural residents. The basic old-age insurance system and the basic medical insurance system, promote the coordinated development of the urban and rural minimum living security system, steadily promote the full coverage of the permanent population of urban basic public services, and fully integrate the farmers who have settled in cities into the urban housing and social security system.
Fifth, on promoting the extensive and multi-level institutionalized development of consultative democracy.
Consultative democracy is a unique form and unique advantage of my country's socialist democratic politics, and an important manifestation of the party's mass line in the political field.
Promoting consultative democracy is conducive to improving the orderly political participation of the people, strengthening the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the people, and promoting scientific and democratic decision-making.
The plenary session decided to promote the extensive and multi-level institutionalized development of consultative democracy as an important part of the reform of the political system. , and insist on consultation before and during decision-making.
It is necessary to build a consultative democracy system with reasonable procedures and complete links, expand the consultation channels of state power organs, CPPCC organizations, party groups, grass-roots organizations, and social organizations; carry out in-depth legislative consultation, administrative consultation, democratic consultation, political participation consultation, and social consultation; The important role of the united front in deliberative democracy, give full play to the role of the CPPCC as an important channel for deliberative democracy, improve the system of the CPPCC, standardize the content and procedures of consultation, expand the form of deliberative democracy, and organize special consultations, counterpart consultations, and consultations in a more active and orderly manner. Sector consultation and proposal handling consultation to increase the density of consultations and improve the effectiveness of consultations.
Sixth, on reforming the judicial system and operating mechanism.
The judicial system is an important part of the political system.
Over the years, the opinions of the masses on judicial injustice have been concentrated, and the lack of judicial credibility is largely related to the unreasonable judicial system and working mechanism.
Judicial reform is one of the focuses of this comprehensive deepening reform.
The decision of the plenary meeting put forward a series of interrelated new measures, including reforming the judicial management system, promoting the unified management of people, property and property in local courts and procuratorates below the provincial level, exploring the establishment of a judicial jurisdiction system that is properly separated from administrative divisions; improving the operation mechanism of judicial power and improving the main The trial judge and collegial panel have a case-handling responsibility system, allowing the judges to make judgments and the judges are responsible; strictly regulate the procedures for commutation, parole, and medical parole; improve the mechanism for preventing, correcting, and investigating wrongful cases, and strictly implement the rule of exclusion of illegal evidence; establish law-related lawsuits and petitions End the system in accordance with the law; abolish the re-education through labor system, improve the punishment and correction laws for illegal and criminal acts, and so on.
These reform measures are of great significance to ensure that judicial organs independently exercise judicial and procuratorial powers in accordance with the law, improve the judicial power operation mechanism with clear rights and responsibilities, improve judicial transparency and credibility, and better protect human rights.
Seventh, on improving the anti-corruption leadership system and working mechanism.
The issue of anti-corruption has always been the subject of much discussion inside and outside the party.
The main problems at present are that the functions of anti-corruption agencies are scattered and do not form a synergy, some cases are difficult to be resolutely investigated and dealt with, and there are frequent corruption cases but insufficient accountability.
The plenary meeting decided to focus on strengthening the innovation of anti-corruption systems and mechanisms and institutional guarantees.
The main purpose is to strengthen the unified leadership of the Party over the construction of a clean government and the anti-corruption work, clarify that the Party Committee is responsible for the main body and the Disciplinary Committee is responsible for supervision, and formulate and implement a practical accountability system; improve the anti-corruption leadership system and working mechanism, and reform and improve all levels The function of the anti-corruption coordination group stipulates that the investigation and handling of corruption cases should be dominated by the leadership of the higher-level disciplinary committee; it reflects the strengthening of the leadership of the higher-level disciplinary committee over the lower-level disciplinary committee, and stipulates that clue handling and case investigation must be reported to the party committee at the same level. The Commission for Discipline Inspection dispatched disciplinary inspection agencies to the party and state organs at the central level to improve the inspection system of the central government and provinces, regions and municipalities, so as to cover all localities, departments, enterprises and institutions.
These measures are put forward on the basis of summarizing practical experience and absorbing opinions from various quarters.
Eighth, on accelerating the improvement of the Internet management leadership system.
Network and information security involves national security and social stability, and is a new comprehensive challenge we face.
From a practical point of view, in the face of the rapid development of Internet technology and applications, the current management system has obvious drawbacks, mainly multiple management, overlapping functions, different powers and responsibilities, and low efficiency.
At the same time, with the increasingly strong attributes of Internet media, online media management and industry management are far from keeping up with the development and changes of the situation.
Especially in the face of the rapid growth of users of social networks and instant messaging tools such as microblogs and WeChat, which have fast dissemination, great influence, wide coverage, and strong social mobilization ability, how to strengthen the construction of online legal system and public opinion guidance to ensure the order of online information dissemination and the national Security and social stability have become prominent real problems before us.
The plenary meeting decided to put forward the policy of adhering to active utilization, scientific development, management according to law, and ensuring safety, intensifying efforts to manage the network according to law, and improving the leadership system of Internet management.
The purpose is to integrate the functions of relevant institutions, form a joint force of Internet management from technology to content, from daily security to crime fighting, and ensure the correct use and security of the network.
Ninth, on the establishment of the National Security Council.
National security and social stability are the prerequisites for reform and development.
Only with national security and social stability can reform and development continue to advance.
At present, my country is facing the dual pressure of safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests externally and maintaining political security and social stability internally, and various predictable and unforeseeable risk factors have increased significantly.
However, our security work system and mechanism cannot meet the needs of maintaining national security, and we need to build a strong platform to coordinate national security work.
The establishment of the National Security Committee to strengthen the centralized and unified leadership of the national security work has become a top priority.
The main responsibilities of the National Security Committee are to formulate and implement national security strategies, promote the construction of the national security rule of law, formulate national security work guidelines and policies, and study and solve major problems in national security work.
Tenth, on improving the national natural resource asset management system and improving the natural resource supervision system.
Improving the national natural resource asset management system is a major reform to improve the property rights system for natural resource assets, and it is also an inherent requirement for establishing a systematic and complete ecological civilization system.
Some prominent problems in my country's ecological and environmental protection are related to the imperfect system to a certain extent. One of the reasons is that the owners of natural resource assets owned by the whole people are not in place, and the rights and interests of the owners are not implemented.
In response to this problem, the Plenary Session decided to put forward requirements for improving the national natural resource asset management system.
The general idea is to implement the ownership of natural resource assets owned by the whole people and establish a system for uniformly exercising the responsibilities of the owners of natural resource assets owned by the whole people in accordance with the principle of separation of owners and managers and management of one matter by one department.
The state exercising ownership and management of natural resource assets owned by the whole people is different from the state exercising the right to supervise natural resources within the territory of the country. The former is the right in the sense of the owner, and the latter is the power in the sense of the manager.
This requires perfecting the natural resource supervision system, uniformly exercising the control responsibilities of all land and space uses, and making state-owned natural resource asset owners and state natural resource managers independent, cooperating and supervising each other.
We must realize that mountains, rivers, forests, fields and lakes are a community of life. The lifeblood of people is in the fields, the lifeblood of the fields is in the water, the lifeblood of the water is in the mountains, the lifeblood of the mountains is in the soil, and the lifeblood of the soil is in the trees.
Use control and ecological restoration must follow the laws of nature. If those who plant trees only focus on planting trees, those who control water only manage water, and those who protect fields simply protect fields, it is easy to take care of one thing and lose the other, and eventually cause systematic ecological damage.
A single department is responsible for the control of all land and space uses within the territory, and it is very necessary to uniformly protect and restore mountains, rivers, forests, fields and lakes.
Eleventh, on the establishment of a comprehensive deepening reform leading group by the central government.
Comprehensively deepening the reform is a complex systematic project, and it is often impossible to rely on one or several departments alone, which requires the establishment of a higher-level leadership mechanism.
The plenary meeting decided that the central government should set up a leading group for comprehensively deepening the reform, which will be responsible for the overall design, overall coordination, overall promotion, and supervision of the implementation of the reform.
This is to give better play to the party's core leadership role in overseeing the overall situation and coordinating all parties, and to ensure the smooth progress of reform and the implementation of various reform tasks.
The main responsibilities of the leading group are: unified deployment of major nationwide reforms, overall promotion of reforms in various fields, coordination of various forces to form a joint force for promoting reforms, strengthening supervision and inspection, and promoting the full implementation of reform goals and tasks.
3. Several issues to be paid attention to in the discussion
The task of this plenary session is to discuss the ideas and plans for comprehensively deepening the reform put forward by the decision of the plenary session.
Here, I give you a few requests.
First, enhance the confidence and courage to advance reform.
Reform and opening up is a new great revolution led by our party under the conditions of the new era. It is the most distinctive feature of contemporary China and the clearest banner of our party.
Over the past 35 years, what has our party relied on to inspire people's hearts, unify thoughts, and gather strength?
What can stimulate the creative spirit and creativity of all the people?
What can we rely on to achieve rapid economic and social development in our country and gain a comparative advantage in the competition with capitalism?
It depends on reform and opening up.
Facing the future, there is no other way than deepening reform and opening up to solve all kinds of problems faced by development, resolve risks and challenges from all sides, make better use of the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and promote sustainable and healthy economic and social development.
At present, on the issue of reform and opening up, both inside and outside the party are very concerned, and the expectations of the whole party and society are very high.
The reform and opening up has reached a new and important juncture.
We must never waver in reform and opening up, the banner of reform and opening up must continue to be held high, and the correct direction of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics must be firmly adhered to.
The whole party must strengthen confidence in reform, and promote reform with greater political courage and wisdom, and more powerful measures and methods.
Second, insist on emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts.
To hold high the banner of reform and opening up, it is not enough to have a stand and an attitude. There must be concrete measures.
Action is the most persuasive.
The Central Committee's decision to use the favorable opportunity of the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee to make arrangements for comprehensively deepening reform is a strategic decision.
We must seize this opportunity and strive to achieve new breakthroughs in comprehensively deepening reforms.
To make new breakthroughs, we must further emancipate our minds.
Breaking through the barriers of ideas and concepts, breaking through the barriers of solidified interests, and emancipating the mind are the first and foremost.
On the issue of deepening reform, some ideological and conceptual obstacles often come not from outside the system but from within the system.
Without emancipation of our minds, it will be difficult for us to see clearly the crux of the solidification of various interests, to pinpoint the direction and focus of breakthroughs, and to come up with creative reform measures.
Therefore, we must have the courage and mind of self-innovation, jump out of the box, overcome the constraints of departmental interests, and study and propose reform measures with a proactive spirit.
Of course, we must be cautious when proposing reform measures, and we must repeatedly study and demonstrate repeatedly.
To carry out reform, the existing work pattern and system operation cannot be broken at all, and it cannot be stable and without any risks.
As long as it has been fully demonstrated and evaluated, as long as it is realistic and must be done, it should be done boldly.
Third, insist on considering problems from the overall situation.
Comprehensively deepening the reform is a major strategic deployment related to the overall development of the party and the country, not a single reform in a certain field or aspect.
"Those who don't seek the overall situation are not enough to seek a domain."
Everyone comes from different departments and units, and they must look at the overall situation. First of all, they should see whether the major reform measures proposed meet the overall needs and whether they are conducive to the long-term development of the party and the country.
We must truly look forward, think ahead, and plan ahead.
Only in this way can the final document truly meet the development requirements of the Party and the people.
Comprehensively deepening the reform requires strengthening the top-level design and overall planning, and strengthening the relevance, systematization and feasibility study of various reforms.
We talk about being bold and taking a steady step, among which, taking a steady step means taking overall consideration, comprehensive demonstration, and scientific decision-making.
Reforms in the fields of economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization are closely linked and intertwined with the reform of party building. Reforms in any one field will affect other fields, and they also require close cooperation with reforms in other fields.
If the reforms in various fields are not matched, and the reform measures in various areas are intertwined, it will be difficult to advance the comprehensive deepening of the reform, and even if it is reluctantly advanced, the effect will be greatly reduced.
Conscientiously unify the thinking into the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(November 12, 2013)
Only when the thoughts and wills of the whole party are unified can the thoughts and wills of the people of all ethnic groups in the country be unified, and a powerful force for advancing reform can be formed.
Here, around the guiding ideology, general thinking, and goals and tasks put forward by the plenary session, I put forward a few requirements for implementing the spirit of the plenary session.
First, insist on improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and advancing the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity as the general goal of comprehensively deepening reforms.
Comrade Deng Xiaoping proposed in 1992 that it would take another 30 years for us to form a more mature and stereotyped system in all aspects.
On the basis of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic thinking, this plenary session proposed to promote the modernization of the country's governance system and governance capacity.
This is an inevitable requirement for the improvement and development of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and the proper meaning of realizing socialist modernization.
The reason why we decided to study the issue of comprehensively deepening the reform at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee is not to promote reform in one area, nor to promote reform in several areas, but to promote reform in all areas, that is, from the overall perspective of the country's governance system and governance capacity.
The national governance system and governance capacity are the concentrated expression of a country's system and system execution capacity.
The national governance system is an institutional system that manages the country under the leadership of the party, including the economic, political, cultural, social, ecological civilization and party building and other fields of institutional mechanisms, legal and regulatory arrangements, that is, a set of closely linked and coordinated countries. Institutions; national governance capacity is the ability to use national institutions to manage all aspects of society, including reform, development and stability, internal affairs, foreign affairs and national defense, governance of the party, the country and the army.
The national governance system and governance capacity are an organic whole and complement each other. Only with a good national governance system can the governance capacity be improved, and only by improving the national governance capacity can the effectiveness of the national governance system be brought into full play.
In fact, how to govern a brand-new society such as a socialist society has not been solved very well in the previous world socialism.
Marx and Engels did not encounter the practice of comprehensively governing a socialist country, and many of their principles about the future society were predictive; Lenin died shortly after the October Revolution in Russia, and did not have time to explore this issue in depth; It has been explored and some practical experience has been obtained, but serious mistakes have also been made, and the problem has not been solved.
After our party came to power in the whole country, it has continuously explored this issue. Although there have been serious twists and turns, it has accumulated rich experience and achieved major results in the national governance system and governance capacity. The progress since the reform and opening up has been particularly remarkable.
my country's political stability, economic development, social harmony, and ethnic unity are in stark contrast to the continuing chaos in some regions and countries in the world.
This shows that our national governance system and governance capacity are generally good, and are adapted to my country's national conditions and development requirements.
At the same time, we must also see that compared with the requirements of my country's economic and social development, compared with the expectations of the people, compared with the increasingly fierce international competition in today's world, compared with the realization of long-term national stability, we still have many things in terms of national governance system and governance capacity. Inadequate, there are many areas that need to be improved.
To truly achieve social harmony and stability and the country's long-term stability, it still depends on the system, on our superb ability in national governance, and on a team of high-quality cadres.
To better leverage the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, we must modernize the country's governance system and governance capabilities in all fields.
Promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity is to adapt to the changes of the times, not only reforming the systems and mechanisms, laws and regulations that do not meet the requirements of practical development, but also constantly building new systems, mechanisms, laws and regulations to make all aspects of the system more scientific and more complete, Realize the institutionalization, standardization and procedure of governance of various affairs of the party, state and society.
It is necessary to pay more attention to the building of governance capacity, enhance the awareness of handling affairs according to the system and the law, be good at using the system and the law to govern the country, transform the advantages of various systems into the efficiency of managing the country, and improve the party's scientific, democratic, and law-based governance.
Second, further emancipate the mind, further emancipate and develop social productive forces, and further emancipate and enhance social vitality.
The "three further liberations" proposed by the decision of the plenary session are both the purpose of reform and the conditions for reform.
Emancipating the mind is the premise and the general switch to liberate and develop social productive forces and liberate and enhance social vitality.
Without the emancipation of the mind, our party would not have been able to make the historic decision to shift the center of the work of the party and the state to economic construction and implement reform and opening up shortly after the ten-year turmoil, thus ushering in a new historical period of our country's development; without emancipation of the mind, our party It is impossible to continuously promote theoretical innovation and practical innovation in practice, effectively resolve various risks and challenges on the way forward, continuously push forward reform and opening up, and always be at the forefront of the times.
Emancipating and developing social productive forces and emancipating and enhancing social vitality are the inevitable result of emancipating the mind and an important basis for emancipating the mind.
To build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, realize socialist modernization, and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the most fundamental and urgent task is to further liberate and develop social productive forces.
Emancipating the mind, liberating and enhancing social vitality is to better liberate and develop social productive forces.
Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: Revolution is the liberation of productive forces, and reform is also the liberation of productive forces. "After the establishment of the basic socialist system, we must fundamentally change the economic system that restricts the development of productive forces, establish a socialist economic system full of vigor and vitality, and promote the development of productive forces. develop" .
Through deepening reforms, we must let the vitality of all elements of labor, knowledge, technology, management, and capital burst out, and let all the sources of social wealth flow fully.
At the same time, in order to deal with the relationship between vitality and order, social development needs to be full of vitality, but this vitality must be orderly activities.
A pool of stagnant water is not enough, nor is a turbulent undercurrent.
We need to strengthen self-confidence in the road, theory, and system, and have a rock-solid spirit and belief, as well as a strong material force to support this spirit and belief.
This depends on continuous reform and innovation, so that socialism with Chinese characteristics is more efficient than the capitalist system in liberating and developing social productive forces, liberating and enhancing social vitality, and promoting all-round development of people, and can better stimulate the enthusiasm and initiative of all the people. It can better provide favorable conditions for social development and win comparative advantages in competition, fully embodying the superiority of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics.
Third, focus on the reform of the economic system and give play to the leading role of the reform of the economic system.
The Plenary Session decided to use the "six close focus" to describe the roadmap for comprehensively deepening the reform, highlighting the focus on economic system reform and giving full play to the leading role of economic system reform.
Our country is still in and will remain in the primary stage of socialism for a long time, the basic national conditions have not changed, and the main social contradiction between the people's growing material and cultural needs and backward social production has not changed. my country is the largest developing country in the world. The status has not changed.
This determines that economic construction is still the central work of the whole party.
At present, many institutional and institutional obstacles restricting scientific development are concentrated in the economic field. The task of economic structural reform is far from being completed, and the potential of economic structural reform has not been fully released.
Adhering to the unswerving focus on economic construction, we must adhere to the unswerving focus on economic system reform.
Upper decision decided by the economic background.
The reform of the economic system has an important influence on and transmission of reforms in other areas. The progress of major economic system reforms determines the progress of many system reforms in other areas, and has the effect of affecting the whole body.
In the Preface to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx said: "In the social production of their own lives, people have a definite, inevitable, and independent relationship with their will, that is, with a certain stage of development of their material productive forces. suitable production relations.
The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the actual foundation upon which a legal and political superstructure is erected and to which a certain form of social consciousness corresponds. "
In the comprehensive deepening of reform, we must adhere to the economic system reform as the main axis, and strive to achieve new breakthroughs in the reform of important areas and key links, so as to lead and drive reforms in other areas, so that the reforms in all aspects can be promoted in concert and form a synergy, rather than Separate governance and decentralize efforts.
Fourth, adhere to the direction of socialist market economic reform.
Proposing the reform goal of establishing a socialist market economic system is a major theoretical and practical innovation of our party in the process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and it has solved a major problem that other socialist countries in the world have not solved for a long time.
For more than 20 years, we have promoted the reform of the economic system and other aspects of the system around the goal of establishing a socialist market economic system, so that our country has successfully realized the transformation from a highly centralized planned economic system to a vigorous socialist market economic system, from a closed and semi-closed economic system. The great historical transition from being closed to all-round opening has achieved a historic leap in people's lives from subsistence and clothing to a moderately prosperous society, achieved a historic leap in the world's second largest economy, and greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people. It has promoted the development of social productive forces and greatly enhanced the vitality of the party and the country.
At the same time, we must also see that although my country's socialist market economic system has been initially established, the market system is not perfect, the market development is not sufficient, especially the relationship between the government and the market has not been straightened out, and the role of the market in resource allocation Effective performance is subject to many constraints, and hard work is still needed to achieve the strategic task of accelerating the improvement of the socialist market economic system proposed at the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
Adhering to the direction of socialist market economic reform, the core issue is to properly handle the relationship between the government and the market, so that the market can play a decisive role in resource allocation and the government can better play its role.
This is another major advance of our party in theory and practice.
Adhering to the direction of the socialist market economic reform is not only the basic adherence to the reform of the economic system, but also an important basis for comprehensively deepening the reform.
Making the market play a decisive role in resource allocation mainly involves the reform of the economic system, but will inevitably affect various fields such as politics, culture, society, ecological civilization and party building.
It is necessary to make the institutional reforms in all aspects move forward in a coordinated manner towards the establishment of a sound socialist market economic system, and at the same time make the relevant links of all aspects better adapt to the new requirements put forward by the development of the socialist market economy.
Fifth, take the promotion of social fairness and justice and the well-being of the people as the starting point and goal.
Since the reform and opening up, my country has made great achievements in economic and social development, providing a solid material foundation and favorable conditions for promoting social fairness and justice.
At the same time, at the current level of development in our country, there are still a lot of phenomena that violate fairness and justice in society.
In particular, with the continuous improvement of my country's economic and social development level and people's living standards, the people's awareness of fairness, democracy, and rights has been continuously enhanced, and their reflection on social injustice has become more and more intense.
The central government has comprehensively reviewed and scientifically analyzed the current situation and situation of my country's economic and social development, and believes that if this problem is not solved quickly, it will not only affect the people's confidence in reform and opening up, but also affect social harmony and stability.
The Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly stated that fairness and justice are the inherent requirements of socialism with Chinese characteristics; on the basis of the common struggle of all the people and economic and social development, we should step up the construction of a system that plays a major role in ensuring social fairness and justice, and gradually establish rights-based systems. A social equity security system with fairness, fairness of opportunity, and fairness of rules as the main content, strive to create a fair social environment, and ensure the people's equal participation and equal development rights.
The decision of the plenary meeting emphasized that comprehensively deepening reforms must take promoting social fairness and justice and improving people's well-being as the starting point and goal.
This is an inevitable requirement for upholding our party's fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly.
To comprehensively deepen reforms, we must focus on creating a fairer and just social environment, constantly overcome all kinds of phenomena that violate fairness and justice, and make more and fairer outcomes of reform and development benefit all people.
If it fails to bring tangible benefits to the common people, if it fails to create a more equitable social environment, or even leads to more injustice, the reform will be meaningless and unsustainable.
The realization of social fairness and justice is determined by many factors, the most important being the level of economic and social development.
At different levels of development and in different historical periods, people with different ideologies and strata have different understandings and demands for social fairness and justice.
When we talk about promoting social fairness and justice, we must proceed from the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people, look at and deal with this issue from the perspective of the level of social development, the overall situation of society, and the perspective of all the people.
Many of the phenomena that violate fairness and justice in my country at this stage are problems in development, which can be solved through continuous development, institutional arrangements, legal norms, and policy support.
We must firmly grasp the center of economic construction, promote sustainable and healthy economic development, further expand the "cake", and lay a more solid material foundation for ensuring social fairness and justice.
In this way, it does not mean that we should wait for economic development to solve the problem of social fairness and justice.
There are problems in a period of time, a society with a high level of development has problems with a high level of development, and a society with a low level of development has problems with a low level of development.
The "cake" keeps getting bigger, and at the same time, the "cake" needs to be divided.
Our society has always had the concept of "do not suffer from widowhood but suffer from inequity".
We must do our best to promote social fairness and justice on the basis of continuous development, do our best and do what we can, and strive to enable all people to have education, work, medical treatment, and old age. New progress has continued to be made in raising, housing and housing.
Regardless of the level of development, the system is an important guarantee of social fairness and justice.
Through innovative institutional arrangements, we will strive to overcome the phenomenon of violation of fairness and justice caused by human factors, and ensure the people's equal participation and equal development rights.
We should use the promotion of social fairness and justice and the improvement of people's well-being as a mirror to examine our various systems, mechanisms and policies. Where there are problems that do not conform to the promotion of social fairness and justice, reforms are needed; which areas and links are outstanding, and which areas are in which areas. Links are the focus of reform.
Issues that violate fairness and justice caused by imperfect institutional arrangements must be promptly resolved, so that our institutional arrangements better reflect the principles of socialist fairness and justice, and are more conducive to the realization, maintenance, and development of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people.
Sixth, relying closely on the people to promote reform.
The people are the creators of history and the source of our strength.
The most fundamental reason why reform and opening up has won the heartfelt support and active participation of the broad masses of the people is that we have deeply rooted the cause of reform and opening up among the people from the very beginning.
The decision of the plenary session summed up the valuable experience accumulated in the reform and opening up. One of the most important ones is to emphasize the need to adhere to the people-oriented, respect the people's dominant position, give full play to the people's initiative, and rely closely on the people to promote reform.
No reform can succeed without the support and participation of the people.
No matter what difficulties and challenges we encounter, as long as there is the support and participation of the people, there will be no difficulties that cannot be overcome, and no hurdles that cannot be overcome.
We must implement the party's mass line, have a heart-to-heart relationship with the people, share weal and woe with the people, and work in unity with the people.
To advance any major reform, we must take the people's standpoint to grasp and handle major issues involving reform, and we must plan reform ideas and formulate reform measures based on the interests of the people.
Wang Fu of the Han Dynasty said: "The movement of a Dapeng is not the lightness of a feather; the speed of a Qiji is not the strength of a foot."
That is to say, the Dapeng flies into the sky, not by the lightness of a feather; the horse runs fast, not by the strength of one foot.
If China wants to fly high and run fast, it has to rely on the strength of its 1.3 billion people.
In the process of comprehensively deepening the reform, when encountering problems of interests that are complicated and difficult to balance, we must seriously think about the actual situation of the masses.
What are the masses expecting?
How to protect the interests of the masses?
Are the masses satisfied with our reforms?
To improve the scientific nature of reform decision-making, it is very important to widely listen to the opinions and suggestions of the masses, summarize the fresh experience created by the masses in a timely manner, fully mobilize the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the masses to promote reform, and condense the wisdom and strength of the broadest masses of people to After the reform, we will work with the people to push the reform forward.
No matter how difficult the reform is, we must move forward
(February 7, 2014)
Brilev: The Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China passed the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reform", and you are the leader of the leading group for comprehensively deepening reform.
What is your governing philosophy?
What are the key areas of China's next reform?
How do you see China's development prospects?
Xi Jinping: This is a major issue related to China's development.
In 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China started the process of China's reform and opening up. It has been more than 35 years and has achieved remarkable achievements.
However, we have to move on.
We put forward the "two centenary" goals.
At present, economic globalization is developing rapidly, competition for comprehensive national strength is more intense, and the international situation is complex and volatile. We believe that in order for China to seize opportunities, meet challenges, and achieve new and greater development, it is fundamentally dependent on reform and opening up.
Moving forward in the fierce international competition is like sailing against the current. If you do not advance, you will retreat.
Now, compared with the past, the breadth and depth of China's reforms are greatly expanded.
To push reform forward, we must strengthen top-level design.
In November last year, the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made an overall plan for comprehensively deepening the reform, and put forward a roadmap and timetable for reform, involving more than 330 major reform measures in 15 areas, including economic, political, cultural, Social, ecological civilization and party building and other aspects.
The marching trumpet of reform has been sounded.
Our overall goal is to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and modernize the country's governance system and governance capacity.
In order to concentrate our efforts on promoting reform, we have established the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reform, with myself as the leader. The task is to make unified deployment and coordination of some major issues, and then break down the tasks and implement them one by one.
I call this "one point deployment, nine points implementation".
Deepening reforms in a country like China with a population of more than 1.3 billion is no mean feat.
After more than 30 years of reform in China, it has entered the deep water zone. It can be said that the easy reform that everyone is happy with has been completed.
This requires us to be bold and steady.
You have to be bold, even if the reform is difficult, you have to move forward, dare to take responsibility, dare to bite the hard bones, and dare to step into the dangerous shoal.
The steps must be stable, that is, the direction must be accurate, the driving must be stable, and especially no subversive mistakes can be made.
I have full confidence in China's development prospects.
Why have confidence?
The most fundamental reason is that after long-term exploration, we have found a correct development path that suits China's national conditions. As long as we firmly rely on the more than 1.3 billion Chinese people and unswervingly follow our own path, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles. Continue to achieve new achievements, and finally achieve the goals we have established.
The Communist Party of China insists on governing for the people, and the people's yearning for a better life is our goal.
My governing philosophy, in a nutshell, is: to serve the people and to take responsibility.
Brilev: You've been China's president for almost a year. How do you feel about leading a country as big as China?
What are your personal hobbies?
Which sports do you like most?
Xi Jinping: China has a land area of ​​9.6 million square kilometers, 56 ethnic groups, and a population of more than 1.3 billion. The level of economic and social development is not high, and the living standards of the people are not high. Governing such a country is not easy. down to earth.
I have worked in different parts of China for a long time, and I know very well that from the east to the west, from the local to the central, there are too many differences at all levels.
Therefore, to be a leader in China, on the basis of getting a clear picture of the situation, you must make overall plans and balance, highlight key points, and drive the overall situation. Small takes the big, the small is the big, and the image is to say that it takes ten fingers to play the piano.
As a leader of the country, the people put me in such a job position, I must always put the people in the highest position in my heart, keep in mind that responsibility is more important than Mount Tai, always take the safety of the people in my heart, work diligently, and work hard at night. The public, always has a heart-to-heart with the people, shares weal and woe with the people, and struggles in unity with the people.
When it comes to hobbies, I personally like reading, watching movies, traveling, and walking.
You know, taking on a job like mine basically doesn't have the time of my own.
During the Spring Festival this year, there is a song in China called "Where has the time gone".
For me, the question is where does my personal time go?
Of course they were all taken up by work.
Now, what I can often do is read, and reading has become a way of life for me.
Reading can keep people's mind alive, inspire them with wisdom, and nourish their spirit.
For example, I have read a lot of Russian writers like Krylov, Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Nekrasov, Chernyshev Sky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Sholokhov, I remember very well many wonderful chapters and plots in their books.
When it comes to sports activities, I like swimming, mountain climbing and other sports. I learned swimming when I was four or five years old.
I also like football, volleyball, basketball, tennis, martial arts and other sports.
In ice and snow events, I love watching ice hockey, speed skating, figure skating, and snow skills.
Ice hockey, in particular, requires not only individual strength and skill, but also teamwork and collaboration. It is a good sport.
Continuously improve the ability to use the socialist system with Chinese characteristics to effectively govern the country
(February 17, 2014)
We must adapt to the general process of national modernization, improve the Party's scientific, democratic, and law-based governance, improve the ability of state institutions to perform their duties, and improve the people's ability to manage state affairs, economic, social and cultural affairs, and their own affairs in accordance with the law. The governance of various affairs is institutionalized, standardized, and proceduralized, and the ability to effectively govern the country by using the socialist system with Chinese characteristics has been continuously improved.
The overall goal of comprehensively deepening the reform put forward by the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and to modernize the country's governance system and governance capacity.
This is an inevitable requirement for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, and it is also the proper meaning of realizing socialist modernization.
Since the reform and opening up, our party has begun to think about the national governance system from a new perspective, emphasizing that the leadership system and organizational system are more fundamental, overall, stable and long-term.
Today, a major historical task before us is to make the socialist system with Chinese characteristics more mature and finalized, and to provide a more complete set for the development of the party and the country, for the happiness and well-being of the people, for social harmony and stability, and for the long-term stability of the country. , a more stable and effective institutional system.
This project is extremely ambitious, and must be a comprehensive and systematic reform and improvement, as well as the linkage and integration of reforms and improvements in various fields.
The national governance system and governance capacity are the concentrated expression of a country's system and system execution capacity, and the two complement each other.
Our national governance system and governance capacity are generally good, have unique advantages, and are adapted to my country's national conditions and development requirements.
At the same time, we still have many areas for improvement in the national governance system and governance capacity, and more efforts are needed to improve the national governance capacity.
Only by focusing on improving the party's governing ability, we can improve the ideological and political quality, scientific and cultural quality, and work skills of our cadres and managers at all levels as soon as possible, and improve the party and state organs, enterprises and institutions, people's organizations, Only when the working capabilities of social organizations and other organizations are improved can the national governance system function more effectively.
To promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, we must fully understand and grasp the overall goal of comprehensively deepening the reform, which is a whole composed of two sentences, namely, improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity.
Our direction is the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
What kind of governance system a country chooses is determined by the country's historical heritage, cultural traditions, economic and social development level, and by the people of the country.
Today's national governance system in my country is the result of long-term development, gradual improvement, and endogenous evolution on the basis of China's historical heritage, cultural traditions, and economic and social development.
my country's national governance system needs to be improved and perfected, but how to improve and how to improve, we must have ideas and determination.
The Chinese nation is an inclusive and tolerant nation. In the long historical process, we have constantly learned from others' good things and turned them into our own, which has formed our national characteristics.
Without firm confidence in the system, it is impossible to have the courage to comprehensively deepen reforms. Similarly, without continuous reform, confidence in the system cannot be thorough and long-lasting.
Our comprehensive deepening of reforms is to make the socialist system with Chinese characteristics better; we say to strengthen confidence in the system, not to rest on our laurels, but to constantly eliminate the shortcomings of the system and mechanism, and make our system mature and durable.
To promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, we must vigorously cultivate and promote the socialist core value system and core values, and accelerate the construction of a value system that fully reflects Chinese characteristics, national characteristics, and characteristics of the times.
To stick to our value system and stick to our core values, we must play the role of culture.
National culture is a unique identification of a nation that distinguishes it from other nations.

Comprehensively deepening the reform is based on the overall interests, fundamental interests, and long-term interests of the country. We must pay attention to avoid the tendency to take what we want and give up what we don't like, and get rid of those mindsets that hinder reform and development.
What is good for the cause of the party and the people, what is good for the vast majority of the people, and what is good for the prosperity and long-term stability of the party and the country, and what should be reformed must be unswervingly reformed.

Use both "invisible hand" and "visible hand"
(26 May 2014)
Making the market play a decisive role in resource allocation and better play the role of the government is both a major theoretical proposition and a major practical proposition.
Scientific understanding of this proposition and accurate grasp of its connotation are of great significance to comprehensively deepening reforms and promoting the healthy and orderly development of the socialist market economy.
On the issue of the role of the market and the role of the government, we must talk about dialectics and the two-point theory, and make good use of the "invisible hand" and "visible hand", and strive to form an organic unity, complementarity and coordination between the role of the market and the role of the government. , mutual promotion pattern, and promote the sustainable and healthy development of the economy and society.
The Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that the reform of the economic system is the focus of comprehensively deepening the reform, and the core issue is to properly handle the relationship between the government and the market, so that the market can play a decisive role in resource allocation and the government can better play its role.
Proposing that the market should play a decisive role in the allocation of resources is a new breakthrough in our party's understanding of the laws of socialist construction with Chinese characteristics, a new achievement of the Sinicization of Marxism, and a new stage in the development of the socialist market economy. .
In order to accurately locate and grasp the decisive role of the market in resource allocation and to better play the role of the government, we must correctly understand the relationship between the role of the market and the role of the government.
The relationship between the government and the market is the core issue of my country's economic system reform.
The Third Plenary of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China revised the fundamental role of the market in the allocation of resources to a decisive role. Although there is only a difference of two characters, it is a brand-new positioning for the role of the market. "These two positions are connected and developed in succession.
Let the market play a decisive role in resource allocation and better play the role of the government, the two are organically unified, not mutually negating, and the two cannot be separated and opposed, and the decisive role of the market in resource allocation cannot be used. It is impossible to replace or even deny the role of the government by better exerting the role of the government to make the market play a decisive role in resource allocation.
Proposing to make the market play a decisive role in resource allocation is actually implementing the problem orientation.
After more than 20 years of practice, my country's socialist market economic system has continued to develop, but there are still many problems. There are still many drawbacks that restrict the vitality of market entities and hinder the market and the law of value from fully functioning.
If these problems are not solved well, it will be difficult to form a perfect socialist market economic system, and it will be difficult to change the development mode and adjust the economic structure.
We must adhere to the direction of socialist market economic reform, promote market-oriented reform in breadth and depth, reduce the direct allocation of resources by the government, reduce the direct intervention of the government in microeconomic activities, and accelerate the construction of a unified, open, competitive and orderly market system. Establish fair, open and transparent market rules, hand over economic activities that can be effectively regulated by market mechanisms to the market, and leave things that the government should not manage to the market, so that the market can fully play its role in all areas where it can play a role, and promote the realization of resource allocation. Maximize benefits and optimize efficiency, so that enterprises and individuals have more vitality and more space to develop the economy and create wealth.
Scientific macro-control and effective government governance are the inherent requirements to give full play to the advantages of the socialist market economy system.
To better play the role of the government, it is necessary to effectively transform government functions, deepen the reform of the administrative system, innovate administrative management methods, improve the macro-control system, strengthen the supervision of market activities, strengthen and optimize public services, promote social fairness and justice and social stability, and promote common prosperity. .
Governments at all levels must administer strictly in accordance with the law, and earnestly perform their duties. The things that should be managed must be managed well and in place, and the powers that should be delegated must be fully and fully in place, and resolutely overcome the dislocation, offside, and absence of government functions.
Adhering to the leadership of the party and giving full play to the party's core role of leading the overall situation and coordinating all parties is an important feature of my country's socialist market economic system.
Over the past 30 years of reform and opening up, the reason why my country's economic and social development has been able to achieve great achievements that are rarely seen in the world, and the reason why our people's living standards have been able to greatly improve, is because of our unswerving adherence to the party's leadership and giving full play to the party organizations at all levels. The role of all party members is inseparable.
In our country, the strong and strong leadership of the party is the fundamental guarantee for the government to play its role.
In the process of comprehensively deepening the reform, we must adhere to and develop our political advantages, use our political advantages to lead and advance reform, mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, and promote the continuous improvement of the socialist market economic system and the better development of the socialist market economy.
Under the new situation, cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres, should insist on deepening learning in practice, deepening practice in learning, constantly studying new problems, summarizing new experiences, and learning to correctly use the "invisible hand" and "visible hand". ” to become an expert at navigating the relationship between the government and the market.
