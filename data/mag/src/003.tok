jeff bezos merely want amazon.com to be earth 's biggest seller of everything .
jeff bezos love be on the move .
he sit in the back of a white van , beam as usual , surround by a team of assistant from amazon.com , the web 's biggest retail store and , someday , if bezos get it right , earth 's biggest store .
the van be drive through coffeyville , a small town on the kansas prairie name after james a. coffey , who set up a grand trading post there in 1860 on the old frontier .
today 's new frontier be comprise of the interconnected wire , router and computer of the net .
the possibility for trade on this frontier be far more fabulous than anyone could ever have be imagine 100 - or even 10 - year ago .
that be where bezos come in .
he van speed down a two-lane road and pull up to the biggest warehouse you have ever see .
we have arrive at amazon 's giant coffeyville distribution center , and bezos ( pronounce bay-zos ) , who be never be here before , be giggle with excitement .
here in coffeyville be another piece of the proof that bezos ' early and fervent belief in the commercial potential of the internet stand as one of the more prescient assumption ever make by a businessperson .
this giant 850,000 square-foot warehouse be stock with book , cd , tv , stereo , video game , software , and toy .
yet only 10 % of the building 's floor area be be use .
the rest be space to grow , here for the ongoing e-commerce revolution .
bezo ' revolution
if all go accord to he daring plan , this warehouse will be fill to capacity within the next few year and will handle everything : wash machine , car , medicine , exercise machine , marmalade , model airplane , everything except firearm and certain live animal .
you name it , amazon.com will sell it .
jeffrey preston bezos be try to assemble earth 's biggest selection of consumer goods , and put they on he website for people to find and buy .
and now he be add service too , such as banking , insurance , and travel .
it be incredibly risky .
how important be the amazon brand name ?
another question ... how long can he investor 's money hold out ?
bezos have already burn through a fortune in cash with no sign of slow down .
accord to estimate , the company 's net loss be approximately $ 350 million last year alone .
the e-commerce world have change since july , 1995 , when amazon be bear .
many other giant e-commerce warehouse now specialize in sell a overwhelming selection , great price and high quality service for a particular category of goods .
adornis.com feature luxury item , for instance , and petopia.com be one of dozen of site for owner of pet .
today , traditional retailer such as wal-mart be make the transition to the web too .
and one of amazon 's most aggressive competitor , ebay , have be profitable from day one use its website as one big auction .
as these competitive website put pressure on amazon 's growth bezos be add category as fast as he can .
during 1999 , he add video game and dvd movie , toy , electronics , software , home-improvement product , auction and zshop - a online flea market where anyone can sell anything .
amazon inc. have also acquire other established internet sale company such as drugstore.com , pets.com , homegrocer.com , and gear.com .
but how long can you build warehouse to the sky and not fill they ?
say scott sipprelle , found partner of the investment firm midtown research group : " the chance of a painful failure go up as the company grow , while debt be go up , margin be go down and loss of available cash be increase . "
however , most analyst think that amazon will succeed over the next few year .
total sale approach a estimate $ 1 billion in 1999 .
" we firmly believe , " say salomon smith barney 's holly becker , " that wall street will realize amazon 's foresight in develop one of the smartest strategy in business history . "
bezos be convince that as more customer come to he site , he 'll be able to offer the lowest price to do the best job of help they find stuff .
but what if people use he site for they shopping research , then go elsewhere for the cheapest price ?
bezos suggest a possible solution : " membership club ! " he say .
" if you want to see all the product information we collect on amazon-all the previous customer comment and professional review - you have to pay $ 30 a year . "
those membership fee would be use to help drive down the price of item , which would be sell almost at cost .
nonmember could shop there , of course .
they just would not have access to amazon 's rich datum for help they choice .
bezos and ; co. have develop a entirely new way of think about the ancient art of selling product , manage employee and satisfy customer .
for instance , the company create a internet " flow experience " that keep customer come back to amazon 's website to read product review or one another 's " wish list . "
this new way of thinking be also visible in the coffeyville warehouse , one of a network of distribution center specifically design to handle e-commerce .
huge banner festoon the warehouse wall list the company 's six core value ( " customer obsession , ownership , bias for action , frugality , high hire bar and innovation " ) .
as a person , bezos be pathologically happy and enthusiastic .
today 's visit to coffeyville be typical .
as usual he be smile , shake hand and shocking new employee with he distinctive laugh , a rapid honk that sound like a flock of goose .
he be a average-size man with warm brown eye who typically wear simple white or blue button-down shirt , khaki and no tie .
during we tour of the plant he run into a huge room fill with 300 new employee who leap to they foot as he enter .
they give he a standing ovation .
" thank you ! " say bezos .
" let i say , thank you for work here ! "
and he laugh that startling laugh .
he launch into a speech about he six core value .
he always begin with the watchword of he faith : the customer come first .
" wake up every morning terrify - not of the competition but of we customer . "
lot of hand shoot up during the q. and a. period which go on for 15 minute .
what do you house look like ?
( it be lovely , and we be amazingly fortunate to live there , he reply . )
just how many item do we sell ?
( eighteen million , so far . )
he answer they all , patiently and directly .
finally , a woman in the front ask , " can i have you autograph ? "
worker suddenly get up and encircle bezos , hand he hat , dollar bill , scrap of paper - anything - for he signature .
welcome to bezosville , u.s. a
the bezos family can trace its american root to frontier people whose role in life be that of risk taker , explore the unknown .

" i have never be curious about he .
my real father be the guy who raise i . "
that guy be mike bezos , a cuban refugee who move to the u.s. by himself when he be 15 year old , with nothing more than two shirt and a pair of pants .

everyone think it would not work , and he have to persuade the bank to lend he $ 400 million .
but he do it . "
amazon 's source
on one day in may , 1994 , 30-year-old jeff bezos be sit at the computer in he office in new york .
he work for d.e. shaw , a unusual research company found by a former professor of computer science at columbia university , dr. david shaw .
the firm specialize in computer-based quantitative analysis to spot emerge trend in business and the stock market .
bezos have a project to explore the still immature internet and hunt for business potential .
when he discover that the internet be grow at a rate of 2,300 % a year , he be stunned .
bezos have graduate from princeton university , major in electrical engineering and computer science .
he work in various financial service company for four year before he get a interview at shaw .
after specialize in the analysis of new business opportunity in the insurance business , he work at shaw shift to the study of the emerge internet boom .
when he start to consider business opportunity on the internet , bezos decide to research mail-order company .
figure that thing that sell well by mail would do well online , he make a list of the top 20 mail-order product and look for where he could create " the most value for customer . "
value , in he equation , would be something customer crave : vast selection , say , or convenience or low price .
and that be what ultimately lead he on one day in may , 1994 , to the idea of sell book on the internet .
there be not any huge mail-order book catalog simply because a giant catalog contain thousand of listing would need to be as large and heavy as a phone book-too expensive to mail .
that , of course , make it perfect for the internet , which be the ideal container for limitless information .
when he learn that book information be already well organize by major wholesaler on cd-rom , he realize it could be put online quite easily .
bezos realize he desperately want to start he own online bookstore .
he wife mackenzie , a english literature graduate of princeton , be all for the adventure .
bezos go to he boss , dr. shaw , who say he understand bezos ' desire to quit and start he own business .
on the advice of shaw , however , bezos spend the next two day consider the risk .
he imagine that he be 80 year old and look back at he life .
he know he would not regret have try to build a online business and fail .
" in fact , i know that if i do not try this , i would regret it . "
a experienced quantitative analyst , bezos figure that the average net start-up have a 1 in 10 chance of success ; he give himself a 30 % chance .
" that be actually a very liberating expectation , expect to fail , " he say .
he tell he first investor - family and friend : " i think there be a 70 % chance you be go to lose all you money , so do not invest unless you can afford to lose it . "
jeff 's father , mike bezos , initially question he son 's idea of quit a cushy job to start a company that would probably fail .
but he parent trust he and believe in he every moment of he life .
" we do not invest in amazon , we invest in jeff . "
that investment total $ 300,000 , a huge chunk of the money they have save for retirement .
today , as 6 % owner of the company , they be billionaire .
on july 4 , 1994 , jeff and mackenzie move to seattle - a city fill with the kind of net-savvy people he would need to hire .
the most important person bezos hire be probably the first : shel kaphan , a brilliant programmer in santa clara , calif. , and veteran of a dozen start-up , many of they , in fact , failure .
he move to seattle to work in the computer-filled garage of the modest two-bedroom home that jeff and mackenzie have rent in bellevue , a seattle suburb .
bezos name he tiny , garage-based company amazon , inc. after the seemingly endless south american river .
by june 1995 a rudimentary website have be create on a hidden site and beta-tested successfully by 300 friend and family member .
kaphan 's code be simple and elegant , allow page to be deliver without delay .
so on july 16 , 1995 , amazon.com open its site to the world .
bezos simply tell all 300 beta tester to spread the word .
during the first 30 day , without any attention in the press , amazon sell book in all 50 state and 45 other country .
the company grow and grow and grow .
in may 1996 , a wall street journal story about amazon introduce amazon to a whole new stream of customer .
it also catch the attention of rival like national bookstore chain barnes and ; noble and the borders group , which have not yet move online .
barnesandnoble.com would appear a year later - just before amazon 's ipo , which go off at a modest $ 18 a share .
at first wall street analyst be afraid of the threat pose by the giant bookstore chain , but barnesandnoble.com do nothing to slow amazon 's amazing sale .
the stock begin to move too , propel bezos ' personal wealth into the ten of million , then into the hundred of million .
and then , when analyst henry blodget , now with merrill lynch , say he believe amazon be a $ 400-a-share company , bezos become another rockefeller .
at the end of 1999 he share be worth $ 10.5 billion .
bezos have cash in less than $ 25 million worth of he stock , but that be enough to live well on , come what may .
bezos do not talk about he wealth or whether amazon will be successful .
instead , he talk about a higher level of consumer service , in which you ll come to amazon , and the one product you be be look for all you life will be feature on the website that day .
you may not even know product even exist , but since the amazon site be so familiar with you consumption habit , it know , and offer the product to you .
if the world go he way , bezos could become even richer than he seattle neighbor bill gates .
then what ?
" at some point , " he say , give mackenzie a hug as the two of they stand around in the kitchen , " we want to figure out how to do philanthropic work effectively , which will require at least as much attention and energy as build a successful company . "
he say the trick to solve some of the world 's problem be to think , amazon-like , in the long term .
" say you want to solve world hunger .
if you think in term of a five-year time frame , you get really depress ; it be a intractable problem .
but if you say , well , let 's see how we could solve this in 100 year - it be a problem because you 'll be dead by then , but the solution become more tractable . "
" anyway , " he add quickly , self-deprecatingly , in probably the same way he tell people he start-up have only a 30 % chance of success , " it 'll be a long time before we build amazon into a lasting company . "
and then he laugh and laugh and laugh .
what happen when you place a order at amazon.com
you order three item online , and a computer in seattle take charge
a computer assign you order - a book , a game and a digital camera - to one of amazon 's seven u.s. huge regional distribution center .
in a regional center , three red light go on you order go to the closest distribution warehouse to you that stock you product .
a worker retrieve a item from the warehouse shelf above a little red light show a product be order .
computer determine which worker go where .
you item be put into crate on move belt each item go into a large green crate contain many customer ' order that ride a series of conveyor belt for several mile through the huge plant .
machine scan the bar code on each item and by many of the distribution facility 's several hundred worker .
all three item converge in a chute , and then inside a box all of the crate arrive at a central point where bar code be match with order number to determine who get what .
you three item end up in a 3-ft . - wide chute and be place into a cardboard box with a new bar code that identify you order .
any gift you have choose be wrap by hand amazon train a elite group of gift wrapper who each process 30 package a hour .
amazon 's warehouse be stock with 4.4 million yard of ribbon and 7.8 million sq. ft. of wrap paper .
the box contain you three item be pack , tape , weigh and label before leave the warehouse in a truck .
a amazon distribution warehouse can ship as many as 200,000 piece a day .
about 60 % of order be ship via the u.s. postal service ;
ups ship nearly everything else .
products weigh 150 lb . or more require special delivery .
it be time to shape up : european be face a obesity crisis that may only get worse the teenager be cluster around lunch table , wolf down heap of bean on toast or pasta with a spicy eggplant sauce , butter they bread , peel orange .
these kid be refuel .
it be midway through week five of a six-week sport camp , and they have spend the morning run and do basketball drill .
that - along with the fact that they be , after all , teenagers-means they be hungry .
base at leeds metropolitan university , the carnegie international camp be britain 's first summer weight-loss program for child , and they counselor know exactly how many calorie be on those lunch plate .
some 40 boy and girl , 11 to 17 , pay $ 550 a week to be put on monitored meal plan , attend nutrition class , have they body fat measure and , every day , exercise until they be ready to drop - or at least feign knee injury .
all of these kid have to be around 35 % above the world health organization 's mean recommend weight to be accept and choose to spend they summer vacation this way .
it be nice , some of the camper say , to be someplace where they be not outcast : where some of they , for the first time ever , can make friend , go on date , and get special attention in sport class , rather than get choose last .
by summer 's end the weight loss be not dramatic .
most camper shed around two kg a week .
that slow , steady loss , rather than some dramatic disappearance of pound that will reappear by christmas , be exactly what paul gately , the camp 's founder and a lecturer in exercise physiology and health at the university , intend .
" the main aim be to encourage they to be active and competent andlsqb ; at sport andrsqb ; , and then they 'll get confident , " he say .
" and if you get they early you can prevent disease later in life . "
in we weight-obsessed society , it be sometimes easy to forget that more than a cosmetic issue fat be also a press health concern .
gately be a member a small european community of health and medical professional who be focus on one of the region ' most serious and most misunderstand ealth problem : obesity .
obesity be define by who as a body mass index ( bmus ) - one 's weight in kilogram divide by the square of one 's height in meter - equal to or greater than 30 .
a person 1.78-m tall and tip the scale at 125 kg , for example , would have a bmus of 39.5 , definitely obese .
it be a risk factor for a wide range of serious medical condition , include diabetes , heart disease , stoke , certain form of cancer , gall bladder disease and joint problem .
america remain the fattest developed country , with 20 % or male and 25 % of female adult clinically obese .
but almost one-third of people live in the european union be now overweight and one in 10 be obese .
these number have shoot up between 10 and 40 % in the last decade alone , depend on the country .
last year the british , with 17 % of male and 20 % of female adult obese , pull ahead of the germans to become europe 's fattest people .
twenty year ago , only about 7 % of the british population be obese .
who estimate that in some european country close to 10 % of schoolchildren be obese , while one long-term study of german schoolchildren show they obesity rate double in the last 20 year .
even in europe 's slimmest nation , such as france , italy and sweden , the trend curve just keep get curvier .
in america , the latest estimate show that healthcare cost for obese adult be $ 238 billion annually .
even that staggering figure do not take into account the costly loss of employee ' productivity due to problem relate to obesity .
germany be one of the few european nation begin to calculate the price of this epidemic , and the number be sobering .
accord to a 1993 report by the german health ministry , around $ 179 million be spend on obesity treatment each year .
another $ 177 million go to the temporary disability of obesity patient .
another 1998 report by german obesity expert alfred wirth , a professor of internal medicine and senior physician at teutoburgerwald clinic in bad tothenfelde , calculate that $ 19.4 billion be spend on the treatment of illness which can arise from obesity .
that figure represent 6 % of the overall expense of the german health system .
yet no european government be tackle the obesity problem with either a public health campaign or research .
despite the glitter promise of new diet drug and the proliferation of fat-free food and miracle potion , the fundamental strategy for treat the condition have barely change in the past two decade .
the usual old belief , put simply , be that to lose weight one must expend more energy than one consume .
put even more simply : eat less , exercise more .
however , meet the challenge of obesity be not all that simple .
" the nature of the physical demand on people at work and in the home have be completely transform in recent decade , " say professor philip james , chairman of the international obesity task force and one of britain 's lead anti-obesity advocate .
" as we drop we physical activity but maintain the nature of we diet , it be a absolutely gorgeous combination for make we fat . "
without dramatic shift in lifestyle , there may be no turn back .
indeed , some people have already give up .
in the uk some high street shop be simply resize woman 's clothing to keep more woman in the " average " zone .
and in the us the food industry be develop snack that people can eat with one hand , that be , snack for people to eat while drive a car .
europe be not quite that bad-yet .
but fast food be fast encroach .
in the uk the number of fast food outlet double between 1984 and 1999 , and even in france , a new mcdonald 's open every five day .
in rome , there be a dunkin donuts in sight of the trevi fountain , and mcdonald 's italian revenue soar 27 % in 1998 over the previous year .
throughout europe , " american-size " portion or all-you-can-eat buffet be become popular , along with a greater emphasis on package and prepare food .
dr. susan jebb , head of the nutrition and health section at the british medical research council 's centre for human nutrition research , caution that it be mislead to pin the blame for obesity on fast food , which like most other thing be perfectly fine to eat in moderation .
in fact , some study show that average calorie consumption have actually decline in the past two decade .
" what people do not recognize be the decline in energy expenditure , " say jebb .
despite the dramatic rise in obesity and its public and personal cost , the condition have traditionally be a difficult one to treat , begin with the fact that it have not always even be recognize as a problem .
when he first become interested in the subject in the 1970 , say james , " this be a completely uncharted field as far as the international community be concern .
everybody think i be talk nonsense . "
even now , he say , many doctor be still train to treat disease themselves , rather than look to the root cause , and there be no medically recognize specialty in the field .
obesity also present a problem of perception : many people regard it as the domain of lazy slob who eat too much .
" there be a lot of prejudice around obesity from health professional and employer , " say lyndel costain , a dietician and spokesperson for the british dietetic association .
" it be see as self-inflicted . "
health worker and patient confirm this .
" many fat people be discriminate against , because people see they as weak-willed , " say elly jeurissen , a statistician and fat-acceptance advocate in the netherlands .
by the time patient arrive at the obesity unit at huddinge university hospital in sweden , everything else have fail they , accord to christina persson , a nurse in the day-care program there .
" they have be badly treat by the health system and feel like no one have listen , " she say .
" gp have no time .
they say , ' okay , you be fat , you have to lose weight . ' even if it be someone who need therapy . "
or other medical help .
" i have hear such bad story , you can not imagine , " say paul rooth , a doctor at the unit .
" i have a woman last christmas-her gp refer she .
she would be complain about heaviness in she lower abdomen .
it turn out she have ovarian cancer , and she die three month later . "
another difficulty lie in the various type and cause of obesity .
scientist be just begin to unravel the genetic component of obesity and the intricate workings of hunger and satiety .
" we have to ask ourselves why some people can eat a lot and remain slim , " say dieter johnsen , a nutrition expert at the german institute for nutrition research , " while other get fat though they eat normally . "
but so far only three gene defect that actually cause obesity have be isolated-two of which involve leptin , a hormone that act as a sort of fat brake in the brain-and those mutation have be discover among only a handful of people .
in the meantime , the gene pool across europe have not change nearly as dramatically as the rise in obesity .
" there be undoubtedly a genetic susceptibility , " say jebb .
" but what allow that susceptibility to manifest itself be a combination of behavioral and environmental factor . "
doctor who work with obese patient compare many of they to alcoholic or drug addict , perhaps eat compulsively because of ingrained psychological problem .
" but in contrast to other addictive behavior , where zero intake be the target , you still need to eat to survive , " say professor stephan rossner , director of the huddinge obesity unit and president of the international association for the study of obesity .
" the much harder task be to use these thing in moderation . "
rossner have that a treatment that work for one person may have disastrous and discouraging result for another .
" we can not predict what will work , " he say .
" to tell woman who be obese because of childhood abuse to go exercise be useless .
and former elite athlete ( who still eat as if they be in training ) do not need to talk about they childhood . "
rossner be take a equally holistic approach to treat obesity at he clinic in stockholm .
the clinic , which have a annual budget of less than $ 500,000 and log 3000 patient visit a year , be cash-strapped and rely on pharmaceutical company for grant .
they be also work on a range of other study into hunger and satiety , and be train other to treat obesity in the field .
they see people through a rigorous 12-week day-care program , combine aspect of behavioral therapy with such basics as teach the patient how to prepare breakfast .
but ask the member of the unit what they would like to see in term of treatment , and they all say , " more . "
the new obesity drug may work for some ; bariatric surgery - in which the stomach be surgically reduce - can help those most severely obese ; extend counseling combine with a diet and exercise regime can be the answer for other .
but above all , obesity treatment must go hand in hand with a public health initiative , and this , many people believe , can only come from government .
costain of the british dietetic association would like to see more education through media and health outlet about the importance of physical activity , and sweeping change in school and the workplace .
at work , for instance , costain support the idea of make shower available for employee who want to exercise at lunchtime and the practice of offer a healthier range of food in company cafeteria .
finland , which have some of the heaviest people in europe - offer a excellent example of what can be do on a large scale , at least when it come to reduce heart disease .
in the 1970 , karelia in east finland be the heart attack capital of the world , and finnish man in general have the highest coronary mortality rate .
doctor and health authority begin educate citizen about risk factor for heart disease by involve the media , local business , medical professional and politician .
" we start with the message that heart disease can be prevent , " say professor pekka puska , director of the project .
" we ask people to make healthy lifestyle change for they own benefit and as a example to other . "
it work .
by 1995 , the incidence of coronary heart disease mortality have drop by 73 % in north karelia and 65 % in all of finland .
so far , say dr. aila rissanen , president of the finnish association for the study of obesity , she have be unable to persuade either the government or local health authority to launch a similarly large-scale anti-obesity campaign .
one country that be attempt such a concerted effort be the czech republic , which have see a level off of obesity rate since 1985 .
the country have a obesity management system that include five regional center for obesity management , around 40 independent obesity specialist , counseling center and weight-reduction club .
in the uk , one might expect the government to be spearhead anti-obesity effort .
in fact , the focus remain on eliminate smoking , still the number one killer , along with cancer and cardiovascular disease , whose rate will not decline , of course , unless obesity be reduce .
tessa jowell , outgoing british minister of state for public health , cite a number of interlock initiative , include national lottery-funded healthy live centers , cooking program for child , improve the availability of fresh food in deprive area .
nevertheless , jowell take a very firm position that obesity be , to some extent , a personal matter , where people need " to take responsibility for themselves . "
jowell be also recognize that many obese people would like the government-and everyone else-to stay out of they affair .
in america , the " fat acceptance " movement be , well-advanced , with anti-discrimination law firm cater to a overweight clientele and movement to enlarge movie theater seat .
in europe , fat people be just begin to assert they rights .
a organization call eurobesitas plan to set up free call center throughout europe next year to provide overweight people with credible information .
like smoking , what people know to be healthy and what they choose to do about it be two very different proposition .
" obesity , " admit jebb , " be not the kind of disease you be likely to be able to cure .
it be a chronic , relapse problem .
andlsqb ; treat it andrsqb ; be a incredibly daunting prospect . "
but the consequence of leave it untreated may be more daunt still .
chris niedenthal , a warsaw-based photographer , have take to slather he cheese with butter .
when he be thirsty , sometimes he gulp down a nice tall glass of 30 % - fat heavy cream .
for breakfast he 'll have all the bacon and egg he want - but no toast .
what be miss from he diet ?
fruit , vegetable and all but 50 g of carbohydrate a day .
" the best thing , really , be fry pork , " he say .
as sure as a yo-yo go down , then right back up , there will always be new diet .
there will always be people willing to offer glowing testimonial to add to the bottom line of the estimate $ 35 billion-in the u.s. alone-diet industry .
niedenthal say that not only have he lose 12 kg in 18 month on he counterintuitive diet regime , " i have much more energy and my complexion have improve . "
as for he cholesterol level , well , he have not have they check yet .
the diet that niedenthal follow , the " optimal nourishment " plan , be develop by a pole name jan kwasniewski , a doctor whose book be sell on street corner .
optimal nourishment also resemble a version of the extreme low-carbohydrate mania now sweep the united states ;
rumor have it that television star jennifer aniston owe she new skinny frame to it .
several current best seller include a new edition of the " diet revolution " by dr. robert c. atkins of 1970s and new book call sugar busters ! by some very clever businessman and a doctor .
the idea behind sugar busters ! be that anything that raise insulin level , such as sugar , potato , corn , white rice , bread from refine flour , fresh fruit or milk , be bad for you .
this notion originally come from the writings of france 's favorite diet writer , michel montignac .
the french may have obesity level of only around 8 % , ( three time lower than americans ) but as they love of anti-cellulite cream reveal , they be not immune from a belief in the miracle cure , and montignac have benefit handsomely .
a former employee of a pharmaceutical firm , he have write 11 book which have sell 9 million copy in 28 country , espouse the montignac method : consume those carbohydrate that reduce the glucose in the blood .
" if you be overweight it be not that you eat too much but that you do not eat well , " montignac say .
" it be complete nonsense today to say that in order to lose weight one have to do sport . "
but perhaps not as nonsensical as some of the other weird stuff out there .
in britain there be a new product call " x-fat " that be derive from shellfish and allegedly keep fat from be absorb by the body .
some german have take to drink cider vinegar neat .
and the truly desperate can always munch on matricur , a sponge that , when swallow , swell to 18 time its size and fill up the stomach .
not surprisingly , all of this make nutrition expert despair .
" if those fad work , there would not be a billion-dollar diet industry , " say bettye travis , president of the board of director of the u.s. national association to advance fat acceptance .
" people would lose they excess weight and that would be it . "
british dietician lyndel costain agree .

new treatment and medication be emerge to offer relief for many million of sufferer
although a estimate 50 million americans suffer from chronic pain , only 26 % of those battle moderate to severe pain see the proper specialist .
the complexity of diagnose the condition and design a treatment for a specific patient , especially prescribe possibly addictive narcotic-based painkiller , can make this a task if a physician be not well-versed in pain management .
chronic pain be generally define as persistent pain , like daily migraine , or pain that continue after a injury heal or fail to heal .
dr. russell portenoy of new york city 's beth israel medical center , president of the american pain society , urge a comprehensive assessment of the pain 's characteristic , include its cause and impact on the patient 's activity and quality of life .
if doctor undertake a assessment without you ask , that be fine .
but if they be prescribe for you without a thorough exam , you should be suspicious .
in the 90 , unconventional pain medication have explode onto the scene .
these drug be consider adjuvant therapy because they be usually use in conjunction with conventional medication when the latter fail to provide relief .
occasionally they be prescribe alone .
surprisingly , new painkiller be antiseizure medication .
accord to southern medical journal , anecdotal evidence suggest that antiseizure drug provide the best relief for neuropathic pain , associate with nerve problem .
the newest and most successful have be gabapentin , which seem to relieve a wide range of nerve pain , include that often accompany cancer and aid .
drowsiness , dizziness , nausea and unsteadiness can usually be alleviate by adjust the dosage of the drug , while more severe side effect , such as liver toxicity , blood disorder and disturbed vision , be relatively rare .
antidepressant have be use for the past 20 year as adjuvant in pain relief .
the most effective appear to the tricyclic , prescribe for a broad spectrum of pain , include headache , arthritis , chronic low-back pain , fibromyalgia , cancer pain and diabetic nerve pain ; they can in some people lower blood pressure , create confusion and cause constipation and urine retention .
chronic pain make life miserable for million .
fear of addiction be understandable , but evidence suggest that many of the older and newer medication can be safely prescribe .
they will not work for everyone , but there be a strong chance , if you suffer from chronic pain , they ’ll make you life a lot more comfortable .

a vaccine be possible , but the final death toll depend on how asia cope
predict the future be risky business for a scientist .
it be safe to say , however , that the global aid epidemic will get much worse before it get any better .
sadly , this modern plague will be with we for several generation , despite major scientific advance .
as of january 2000 , the aids epidemic have claim 15 million life and leave 40 million people live with a viral infection that slowly but relentlessly erode the immune system .
accounting for more than 3 million death in the past year alone , the aid virus have become the deadliest microbe in the world , more lethal than even tb and malaria .
there be 34 develop country where the prevalence of this infection be 2 % or greater .
in africa nearly a dozen country have a rate higher than 10 % , include four southern african nation in which a quarter of the people be infect .
and the situation continue to worsen ; more than 6 million new infection appear in 1999 .
this be like condemn 16,000 people each day to a slow and miserable death .
fortunately , the aids story have not be all gloom and doom .
less than two year after aid be recognize , the guilty agent - human immunodeficiency virus , or hiv - be identify .
we now know more about hiv than about any other virus , and 14 aid drug have be develop and license in the u.s. and western europe .
the epidemic continue to rage , however , in south america , eastern europe and sub-saharan africa .
by the year 2025 , aids will be by far the major killer of young african , decrease life expectancy to as low as 40 year in some country and single-handedly erase the public health gain of the past 50 year .
it be asia , with its huge population at risk , that will have the biggest impact on the global spread of aid .
the magnitude of the pandemic could range from 100 million to 1 billion , depend largely on what happen in india and china .
four million people have already become hiv-positive in india , and infection be likely to reach several percent in a population of 1 billion .
half a million chinese be now infect ; the trajectory of china 's epidemic , however , be less certain .
a explosive aid epidemic in the u.s. be unlikely .
instead , hiv infection will continue to fester in about 0.5 % of the population .
but the complexion of the epidemic will change .
new hiv infection will occur predominately in the underclass , with rate 10 time as high in minority group .
nevertheless , american patient will live quality life for decade , thanks to advance in medical research .
dozen of powerful and well-tolerated aid drug will be develop , as will novel means to restore the immune system .
a cure for aid by the year 2025 be not inconceivable .
but constrain by economic reality , these therapeutic advance will have only limited benefit outside the u.s. and western europe .
a vaccine be we only real hope to avert disaster unparalleled in medical history .
a large , concerted effort of research be launch three year ago in the u.s. and hint of promising strategy be emerge from experiment in monkey .
but even if a aid vaccine be develop before 2025 , it will require a extraordinary effort of political will among we leader to get to the people who need it most .
the cabbage cure
if you have hear it once , you have hear it a thousand time : eat you fruit and vegetable !
now there be a new reason to do so .
five serving a day may reduce the odds of ischemic stroke by 25 % , and 10 serving - swallow hard - by 31 % .
fruit and veggy seem to help prevent the formation of dangerous blood clot associate with stroke .
the best of the bunch : cruciferous vegetable like broccoli and cabbage , as well as citrus fruit .
hat off !
it be only a first step , but scientist may be a hair closer to a cure for baldness .
use injection of a gene - nickname the sonic hedgehog - they have be able to awaken hair follicle from a rest state and force they into a active one .
alas , that be just in mouse .
whether the therapy work on human pate remain to be see .
one potential problem : the sonic hedgehog gene be link to basal-cell carcinoma , a common , treatable skin cancer .
can that headache !
remember when botulism be a bad thing ?
still be , if you happen to consume the toxin from a contaminate batch of can food .
but now , year after doctor discover the toxin 's uncanny ability to smooth out wrinkle and quell tremor , a new benefit have be uncover : botulism toxin seem to alleviate migraine headache .
in a preliminary study , half the patient whose forehead be inject with tiny amount of the botulism drug botox report that they migraine headache disappear - and stay away for up to four month .
bone up
do not think you be immune to osteoporosis just because you be a guy .
in the u.s. alone , 2 million man have the bone-thinning ailment , and 3 million more may be at risk .
now here be some help : the first major study on man with osteoporosis show that fosamax - a non-hormonal drug that help treat the disease in postmenopausal woman - also work in man .
the bone density of man who take it increase 7 % regardless of they age .
bad news
time lapse sorry , jet-lag sufferer .
a report show that melatonin may be no better than a sugar pill in alleviate the sleepiness and disorientation of long-distance travel .
nearly 250 subject be give either a placebo or one of two commonly use dose of melatonin ( 5 mg and .5 mg ) .
result : they all experience similar jet-lag symptom , and all recover after about six day .
snooze alarm
talk about a drunken stupor .
doctor say not get enough sleep may dull you sens as much as drinking alcohol do .
folk with sleep-apnea - a common disorder in which sufferer momentarily awaken throughout the night because breathing stop - do worse on 3 out of 7 test of reaction time than those whose blood-alcohol level would make they too drunk to drive in some american state .
could ordinary insomniac run into the same problem ?
probably , doctor say .
this rigorous form of filmmaking be all the rage .
first stop : copenhagen .
next stop : hollywood ?
in he conference room on the universal lot , steven spielberg show a couple of guest a print card .
on the card be " the vow of chastity " - ten commandment of simplify filmmaking , as proclaim in the dogme '95 manifesto by director lars von trier and thomas vinterberg .
spielberg speak enthusiastically about dogme and say he would like to make a film under its rule .
wait a minute .
why should the most successful filmmaker in history subject himself to these severe cinemagraphic restriction , jot down in half a hour by a couple of daffy danes ?
why would any director toss away the tool of power and sorcery that the movie have spend a century develop ?
no 150-person crew , no wide screen , no post-synchronizing of dialogue , no e.t. or dinosaur .
no tripod for the camera .
and no director 's credit .
yet dogme be the hot word in serious film circle .
its precept be first use in vinterberg 's the celebration , the dysfunctional family drama that be a world-wide success .
dogme 2 be von trier 's the idiot , a aggressive comedy with porno element .
then come three more film : soren kragh-jacobsen 's mifune , about a young businessman who go home to settle he late father 's estate ; kristian levring 's the king be alive , set in namibia and star jennifer jason leigh ; and , release , the first american dogme film , julien donkey-boy , by genius nasty boy harmony korine .
if dogme spread beyond art house , it will be not because it suggest a vital new way to make picture , but because today 's director feel crush by technological gimmickry .
the acrobatic cinematography of the french new wave , the anti-dramatic film of bresson and antonioni , the non-linear experiment of the american avant garde - each of these be a revolutionary call to arm .
dogme be a call to disarm , to do away with false pretens , to walk without crutch supply by industrial light and ; magic .
dogme love innocence ; it aim for a primitive purity .
" filmmaker and filmgoer be yearning for something else , " say cinematographer anthony dod mantle , who shoot the celebration , mifune and julien donkey-boy .
" but not necessarily something new .
a refocusing on the story .
the nakedness and simplicity of dogme have put we back in touch with the essential of filmmaking . "
korine , write the satricial film kid , then make on he own the controversial film gummo .
he have already be plan he recent film julien donkey-boy , which be the story of a schizophrenic ( scottish actor ewen bremner ) , he bullying dad ( werrier herzog ) and pregnant sister ( chloe sevigny ) , when von trier suggest he make it under dogme stricture .
" i like the idea of it be a rescue action from the level of cosmetic , " he say , " the idea of not hide behind the trickery . "
bremner find that the stripped-down system let he focus on he craft :
" i do not have to reserve a portion of my brain to monitor technical mechanics-lighting rig , camera track , field of focus .
i can dedicate myself fully to realize what i want to do . "
dogme might seem way too , well , dogmatic ; a director who have film under its rule must sign a " confession " of any deviation .
( korine : " i confess that in the turkey-dinner scene , i make my grandmother go to the grocery store and buy a batch of raw cranberry ... " )
but dogme be as much a game as it be a cult .
indeed , korine break nearly every dogme rule .
at the beginning of julien donkey-boy he stage a violent death ( rule 6 ) .
at the end he credit himself ( rule 10 ) .
in between he all kind of optical trick ( rule 5 ) .
and what happen to the vaunted dogme " simplicity " ?
julien donkey-boy be 1999 's most mannered film .
nothing scream artifice so much as the collision of the reel and the real .
the danger of any innovation be that it quickly become calcified .
but that may not happen with dogme .
the danish filmmaker who make the first four dogme film hold a highly innovative millennial blast .
each film part of a script write by the four .
each director 's scene be show live on a different tv channel on dec. 31 , with viewer do they own editing by flick the remote .
as u.s. filmmaker , lock in stasis , consider the next century , the danish challenge might look appealing .
a glum romance lack wit , glamour or passion after many year of study and practice , harrison ford have nearly master the art of talk without move he lip .
kristin scott thomas be newer at the game of mask she emotion , but chilly elegance have all but eclipse the sexiness she exude in the english patient .
there be no other real news from random hearts , a grim , draggy and dismal romance .
ford be a washington detective name dutch van den broeck ; scott thomas be a congresswoman name kay chandler .
both they spouse be kill in a plane crash , and he suspect that they be lover .
she perhaps agree , but prefer denial and resumption of she re-election campaign .
this be very sensible of she , especially in light of dutch 's maniacal pursuit of all the dreary detail of the adulterous back-story .
watch dutch 's obsessive pursuit of the truth be merely tedious and glum .
apparently , though , kay like sullen plodder .
no other explanation be offer for she decision to enter into a brief , nervous affair with dutch .
what director sydney pollack , one of the movie ' great romantic ( tootsie , out of africa ) , see in this dismal tale be even harder to imagine .
there be no heat , wit or glamour in he tell of it .
this movie have a scandalous premise , but fail to amuse - even through irony .
in the contest to select a america 's cup challenger , the underdog may be short on fund , but memory of team new zealand 's 1995 win fill they sail with hope .
when yacht compete for a slot in the america 's cup , the race can seem like a knife fight .
ed baird , skipper of young america have plan to pack a uzi - but he plan be dash when he us$ 5 million sloop split and nearly sink while race the japanese nippon challenge .
in seconds the us$ 40 million invest in young america 's team and they chance of beat the 10 other contender be jeopardize .
after 13 year of be out of the running , the new york yacht club - holder of the cup for 132 of its 150-year existence - want it back .
however , they be not alone in seek international yachting 's most coveted prize in a winner-take-all series .
new york 's domination end when two upstart , australia and new zealand , become the only country since the cup 's 1851 inception to steal it away .
these team success against the american goliath suddenly signal to everyone that the cup be winnable .
as a result , the cup competition have begin to resemble a all-out war - and not the naval campaign it have always seem .
today in they arsenal team sport cut edge design and building material , world-class sailor , four year of intensive preparation-and stack of cash .
japan 's nippon have even invoke the supernatural by name one boat after a indian god of war - and another after a god of speed .
for the right to take on america 's cup holder team new zealand , challenger begin four month of elimination-series race in the louis vuitton cup .
these gladiator-style battle can last up to three hour .
two 23-meter yacht race over 20 nautical mile up and down a sausage-shaped course mark out by two buoy .
the first to cross the finish line win .
" it be like a game of chess play in formula one car by two rugby team , " say bruno trouble , director of the louis vuitton media center .
young america 's captain , who have help coach team new zealand to they 1995 victory , seem a solid contender until he sloop 's misfortune .
during the race , baird 's lead over nippon have dwindle from 42 seconds to within two boat length .
with a rise swell and the wind touch 20-knot , the young america 's skipper decide to tack in order to maintain he advantage .
" you do not sit back and think i should not turn here because the boat might not handle it , " say baird later .
" we be get to push when it be time to push . "
that push cost young america the race , and possibly the series .
as the yacht turn - it rise high on a wave - then slam down hard twice .
nippon 's crew watch they competitor 's boat crumple as its bow rise roughly 12 meter in the air .
the impact break the deck of the yacht just behind its mast - but the hull hold .
the crew scramble back aboard and miraculously manage to keep the boat afloat .
after the cripple young america be tow back into harbor the new york yacht club request permission to use its second boat - a near twin of the first - for the remain seven in the series .
the club plan to repair and modify they shatter ship-and likely modify the second as well - to make both more resilient .
strengthen these boat however , could make they heavier and slower - thus defeat they design priority of lightness and speed .
like the designer of formula one racecar , the creator of these high-tech , high-performance sloop seek constant technical improvement to gain a extra advantage .
boat now be narrower : since 1992 , they be slim from a average 4.6 m wide to a anorexic 4 m prompt some to assert that they have become too narrow .
baird might disagree .
say baird : " technology win the event , but it be a matter of find the right combination for the venue . "
he imply that rough sea and narrow boat design conspire to split young america .
win through innovation have long be a hallmark of the race .
from 1983 , keel innovation have receive great attention ; in that year a outraged new york yacht club try unsuccessfully to have the winged keel of alan bond 's australian ii ban in a courtroom .
in 1987 new zealand create a furor by race in a fiberglass boat .
the international america 's cup class specification , introduce in 1992 , allow the use of material such as carbon fiber and honeycomb core , but outlaw rotate mast , the heating , cool or soap of hull , and the attachment of move winglet to keel .
with the setback to the new york yacht club entry , attention will focus on the other lead challenger .
in front be prada , which have lose only once before .
in only they second cup challenge , prada be a bright contender .
they sponsor , mr. parizio bertelli , prada couture house ceo , offer to pay for the olympic campaign of three top new zealand-based sailor if they would coach the italian team .
prada skipper and helmsman francesco de angelis , a benefactor of bertelli 's offer , feel europe 's time have come .
" it keep the cup alive if a nation other than america win it , " he say .
americaone , skipper by 1997-98 whitbread round the world race winner paul cayard and back by san francisco 's st. francis yacht club , have a budget of $ 30 million from sponsor that include ford and hewlett packard .
the new york yacht club 's young america have a $ 40 million war chest provide by individual supporter as well as corporation like air new zealand and watchmaker breitling .
nippon have spend more than a decade chase its cup dream .
they australian bear captain , the world 's top-ranked match racer peter gilmour , live in japan for three year to satisfy the cup 's crew-nationality rule .
syndicate head tatsumitsu yamasaki , chairman of spice giant s&b foods , be hungry for a win .
ask if this be the year , gilmour cautiously reply , " the japanese will win ....
it be just a matter of when it will happen . "
in 1995 new zealand show that simply have money do not guarantee victory .
though they budget be not rank in the top five , they win the cup 5-0 against defender dennis conner of the san diego yacht club .
sheer skill prevail as team new zealand outwit the home of nasa , boeing , and the like .
they victory inspire other lower-budget challenger .
suddenly less wealthy team begin to see reason for hope .
le defi , along with young australia , operate on modest budget .
what they lack in money however , they make up for in youth , enthusiasm and passion .
team australia 's crew - entirely under age 25 - have a skipper all of age 20 .
youth hostel and bicycle be the order of the day for these youngster in auckland .
though not favor to win , few doubt that these team will become strong contender as a result of this year 's experience .
for other low-budget team though , the struggle have be simply in get to auckland to recover they $ 250,000 race-entry deposit .
race against a deadline , a lucky first-time swiss team finally find fund to complete they boat .
other have be less fortunate .
among the difficulty : the hijacking of the st. petersburg yacht club 's boat , lack of sponsor for the brit , and legal dispute over miss fund for hong kong .
for all nation , win the america 's cup be proof of technological and sport prowess .
it be also the only race where the winner take home the trophy - and the event .
in auckland , public and private investment have top us$ 63 million for everything from new bar and restaurant to a special america 's village for team and boat .
with a international tv audience , auckland 's little-known port be poise to become world-famous .
the hospitality industry be uncork the bubbly - a new zealand sparkling wine , to celebrate the host of cup .
they be set to showcase the fine food and wine that new zealand have to offer .
the add exposure that australia and new zealand have give the cup have make it all the more desirable for the u.s. to reclaim : the new york yacht club be already forecast a us$ 1 billion boon to the region if the cup return .
the cup spell money - from increase tourism , to international tv rights , to add profit for sponsor .
however while other look to they bottom line , crew be stay focus on they keel , on the weather , on the wave , and on they skill ; for it be these thing matter as well .
as team new zealand 's coutts advise : " money do not win the cup - everything do . "
as hollywood keep tell we , marriage be not always a breeze .
but do trial separation work ?
marriage be big lately ; actually it be unmarriage that seem to be capture we attention .
from the award-winning american beauty to the bruce willis-michelle pfeiffer movie , the story of us , the institution of marriage be be turn inside out , and it be not a pretty sight .
to judge by these film , modern marriage involve a lot of broken crockery and bust expectation .
while many current hollywood depiction of marriage may be overly pessimistic , statistics in america be alarming : each year half as many americans get divorce as marry .
marriage counselor say couple often choose to separate as a last-ditch effort to change they relationship , and possibly themselves .
" many trial separation do not work because they be not ' authentic ' they be just one person 's way of get out of the relationship , " say harriet lerner , author of the book the dance of anger .
but a separation can give couple time to calm down , renegotiate the rule of the relationship and gain some need distance .
for a separation to work , it need to be well define .
constance ahrons , director of the marriage and family therapy training program at the university of southern california , say " structure separation " tend to be the most productive .
couple face separation do best if they establish some basic ground rule first .
they should mutually agree on the length of the separation-ahrons say three to six month be average-and both must continue to work on they own problem during that time , either with or without a counselor .
couple should agree not to see lawyer during they separation .
lawyer have a way of move marriage toward divorce .
during they period of trial separation couple should not pursue each other at all , either to fight or to reconcile , but should agree in advance on what kind of contact they will have .
separate couple can agree to speak on the phone for a prearranged period , for instance , or meet once a week .
some therapist advise they client to agree not to talk to each other about they relationship during these encounter and to use the time apart to reflect on they own life and see what they can change about themselves .
if there be child involve , ahrons say , both party need to agree on all the ground rule have to do with kid .
parent should also be aware that repeat separation and reconciliation be difficult and confusing for child .
ahrons say a separation , while painful , can help keep the anger down and give a couple time to think .
if both be unsure about the future of the marriage , it can provide a time-out , during which they can see what life would be like without the other .
" sometimes , " ahrons say , " a separation can lead back into marriage .
sometimes it lead to divorce .
but if couple be able to clarify thing , it will improve they marriage - or , make they divorce better . "

answer : haul two sled .
but this be what british explorer sir ranulph twisleton-wykeham-fienne , 55 - once call " mad but marvelous " by prince charles - have announce he will do come february .

a trip to gascony ?
no , blair finally suggest , cling desperately to he last shred of dignity , this be a british baby , a dividend of he annual visit to the queen 's retreat at she castle in scotland , balmoral .

whatever air travel bring in the next 20 year , fitness center and piano bar be probably not part of the plan .
although super-jumbo , double-decker aircraft capable of carry up to 850 passenger , be be discuss by aviation executive with vast enthusiasm , anyone who fly a lot know that airline wring every dollar they can out of they available inch .
the airbus industrie a3xx , with a double-decker fuselage which can carry up to 656 people in three class , be the plane that have spark the dream of airborne cruise ship .
its main deck will accommodate economy passenger in the same 3-4-3 configuration as the boeing 747 , but with a extra 26 cm of width .
airbus be bet $ 12 billion that airline will want to fly more passenger on a larger plane .
the firm hope to start make deal with airline next year to deliver the a3xx in 2004 .
the aircraft will cost around $ 200 million , $ 3 million more than a boeing 747-400 , but airbus claim its plane will be at least 15 % more efficient in term of flight cost per seat .
us manufacturer boeing , maker of the 747-400 , do not plan to build a super-jumbo , claim that the market for bigger plane be not big enough to bother .
instead , it be offer a stretch version of the 747 that will seat 500 .
the company be also focus on medium-size , long-range aircraft such as the 301-seat 777-200x that will be able to fly from hong kong to new york nonstop .
boeing foresee the industry 's current " hub-and-spoke " system give way to more point-to-point connection , which many flyer prefer .
airbus executive agree that more varied , long-range route will develop , and they be plan aircraft to serve they .
but the european firm figure that major population center will still dominate traffic .
passenger capacity in asia be expect to triple in the next two decade , from the current 442,000 seat a year to 1.2 million .
airbus predict that by 2018 there will be 660 super-jumbo in the sky over asia .
critic say that this will mean longer board and disembark time plus longer wait at immigration , baggage claim and custom .
airbus argue that a additional exit door will let passenger get off the a3xx as quickly as they would the 747-400 .
and have larger jet may mean have fewer plane .
fewer plane take off and landing will equal less wait on the tarmac .
larger aircraft may mean more amenity for passenger in first and business class and may give rise to a fourth class , something between economy and business .
regardless of the future of commercial aviation , you probably will not be need you water wing in the air .

a skillful blend of horror and promotion create the film event of 1999
in october of 1997 , three young actor go into the wood near burkittsville , maryland , to play in a horror movie .
two year later , they film be a smash .
it be the talk , not just of hollywood , but of moviegoer everywhere .
in the united states last summer , you could hardly walk down a bustling street or log on to a website without trip over that ominous incantation " blair witch . "
the impact , sudden and seismic , of the blair witch project be utterly unprecedented .
never have a - let 's be honest - weird movie budget at a ludicrously low $ 35,000 storm both the box office and the pop consciousness .
in nine week of release in the u.s. , it gross $ 137 million .
this be a incredible nearly 4,000-fold return on its investment .
in percentage term , that make this film the most profitable ever .
its astounding success have make film hero , and very rich young man , of its director , daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez .
and the marketer at artisan entertainment , who build fervant desire to see the film through cunning use of the internet , have be credit with revolutionize the way film be sell .
face with the amazing success of this film , hollywood cheer and shudder .
any movie that scare up business be consider good for the rest of the industry .
but this one become a hit by break too many rule .
film with no star usually make money with charm and sentiment ; blair witch have neither .
if the mass audience will accept something indirect and confrontational - what next ?
the movie be shoot with its actor be put through a eight-day survival game .
they supposedly shoot the film and make up the dialogue while the director lurk out of sight , leave cryptic note and play sneaky trick on they .
what would traditional big studio movie maker think of this ?
if the product be eccentric , so be the peddling .
artisan co-president amir malin call the approach to promote the film " guerrilla marketing tactic . "
blair witch 's creative team hustle the movie 's clip onto a cable tv show .
it premiere the trailer on the insider " ai not it cool news " website .
it also launch its own site , www.blairwitch.com .
the website smartly elaborate on the film 's plot by present " document " about the " blair witch mythology , aftermath and legend . "
anyone who want to believe the story , or enjoy a cleverly design fiction , can browse and learn .
on a investment of $ 15,000 the site rack up 181 million hit by week 's end .
if the marketer at artisan can create a avid audience on cable and in cyberspace , why should fox or warner brothers spend ten of million advertise in u.s. newspaper and on prime time tv ?
no wonder hollywood , look at blair witch , be both impressed and concerned .
the reaction of moviegoer be equally schizophrenic .
to some , the film be a rite of passage and haunted-house trip roll into 81 agitate minute .
because of the audience 's involvement with the film , theater owner have endure a dip in popcorn sale .
during this film nobody leave - except to be sick .
many viewer have vomit during particularly tense scene .
other get motion sickness from the jerk style of the hand-held camera .
a santa cruz , california , woman say that a week after see the movie , she 14-year-old daughter " still can not sleep at night .
she do not want to talk about it .
she will not go outside to feed the dog because she have to pass by some tree , and they remind she of the movie . "
" not all people appreciate the film , however .
i guess i do not get it , " say justin renfroe , 27 , from atlanta .
he advise friend to " wait for the video . "
exit poll show that the film have little interest for black audience , though hispanics get into it .
interestingly , a few moviegoer persist in believe , even after the final cast and credit roll , that this clever fiction be for real .
they think it be a documentary that end in death .
" you mean it be not ? " ask chicago resident paula taylor .
the website make it sound as if it be .
i can not believe it . "
the biggest blair witch shock have be feel by the movie 's director .
" when we do the film , " sanchez say , " we hope for a video or cable deal .
when artisan tell we the film would be release in theater , we be think , ... if we make $ 10 million , it would be a dream come true .
but to do $ 29 million in one weekend , and then to keep go as we have , be beyond we comprehension ... "
perhaps you be wonder how this all get start .
here be the story .
myrick , 35 , and sanchez , 30 , meet in 1990 while film student at the university of central florida in orlando .
" a few year ago , " myrick say " we get on the subject of old ... phoney documentary that really creep we out when we be kid .
later on , we come up with the premise of the three filmmaker get lose in the wood .
we movie would be about the find footage .
from there it germinate into building this mythology . "
here be the premise of the film .
the town of burkittsville , once blair , be haunt by story of a witch .
people say that for two century she have lure child to she home , make some of they face the wall while she kill the other .
fast forward to the film 's first title card : " in october of 1994 , three student filmmaker disappear in the wood near burkittsville , maryland , while shoot a documentary .
a year later they footage be find . "
there be no actor ' or director ' name , no screenplay credit - nothing to hint that the film be not a true story .
thus the film begin to encourage the moviegoer ' capacity to believe ... anything .
the trio of montgomery college student have come to burkittsville to interview the local and spend two day track down the witch 's house in the nearby wood .
director heather donahue , cameraman joshua leonard and sound man michael williams think it will be a lark , but they have underestimate the legend 's potency and overestimate they skill in camping and coping .
within a day or two , they be lose and get on one another 's nerve .
at night , huddle in they tent , they begin to suspect menace from someone or something outside .
could it be the blair witch ?
they hear noise , feel the tent rattle , and find three small rock and twig bundle in a ominous symbol .
then , one morning , they notice slime on josh 's backpack .
the movie continue to get more intense from that point on , but we will not spoil the end for you .
blair witch , like any movie , have many antecedent .
it be , by we casual count , the 873rd horror movie about youth who go into the wood on a lark , and come out dead .
in common with earlier independent horror classic like night of the live dead and the texas chain saw massacre , the new film make a virtue of its seeming artlessness .
a picture 's dead air , ragged act and extreme shift of emotional tone throw the viewer off balance .
this be not you standard hollywood movie , whose technical finesse reassure even as it excite .
the bizarre independent horror film seem unmitigated and out of control .
the pretense go further in blair witch .
since so much be shoot in video ( on heather 's camera ) , it could be a episode of some cheesy real-tv show .
say sanchez : " the rule be , if you see a shaky handheld video image , it must be real . "
something else that attract critic and the first viewer to blair witch be the film 's bold sense of withhold horror , after all , be a genre that gravitate to the lurid edge .
the jaded audience want more - more tease sex , more gross-out gore .
then there be blair witch , it have no sex or even sexual tension , no music of any kind , no demonic power tool .
there be no prowling , voyeuristic camera from the killer 's point of view .
this movie be all about the victim and the victim they make of each other .
there be no shock cut to the monster .
in fact , no visible monster !
the audience see only what the camera do , so at night it be sometimes pitch-black .
for excruciate minute , we be literally in the dark .
there be no slash - except of everything unnecessary to the creation of psychological disorder .
blair witch make the viewer collaborate actively in both the scenario and the scariness .
say sanchez : " horror be something that work in the viewer 's mind , not really onscreen . "
myrick and sanchez have try to cast they main character for two year before find donahue , leonard and williams .
they give the actor a 35-page plot outline and a lesson or two in handle a camera .
josh get a old cp-16-mm film camera .
" we show he how to load it and how not to destroy it , " say myrick .
heather be give a high-8 video camera .
the director buy the high-8 for $ 500 .
after the shooting , they return the camera to the store and get a refund .
for eight day and night in autumn , 1997 , the actor be effectively on they own .
they shoot all the footage , as they character be supposedly do .
they invent they dialogue .
the director say they be usually out of sight and hearing from they star .
each day they would leave note in a box for each actor .
the note give general instruction - clue , really - on what to do .
if mike be to confess he would throw away the map , the other would not know until he say it .
at night , when the actor be in they tent , say sanchez , " we would go out on we raid and scare they - wake they up , leave thing behind .
we basically play the blair witch . "
finally they have 20 hour of footage .
" it be like we write the script during the editing , " myrick say .
they use the other material for a devious promotional film , curse of the blair witch .
it be show on the sci-fi channel in the u.s.
that material also get onto the website design by sanchez .
rarely have outtake prove so useful .
they help create a blair " world . "
" you could get into the spirit of the folklore we create without have to see the movie , " sanchez say , " or vice versa . "
now that they first feature film be head for $ 250 million at the worldwide box office , myrick and sanchez have just one thing ahead of they : the sophomore jinx .
they describe they next film as a crazy and stupid comedy call heart of love .
could it tank ?
of course with any film , failure be always a possibility .
people involve with blair witch realize that the amazing success of this film do not ensure a similar success in the future .
blair witch be a film that antagonize as many folk as it enthrall .
it could be a fleeting fad with no profound meaning for the future of film .
" there be no good lesson to learn here , say john pierson , whose cable show help get blair witch rolling .
" it be not a independent-film phenomenon .
what you really have be a convergence of old and new media . "
and a film that blend the thrill of the unseen with the art of sell the film to the public .
then there be that fascinating behind-the-scenes story : that the actor basically make the film while the director be sneak around play trick on they .
the story could be true , though no one have do it in a century of film-making .
if it be true , then the actor should be get as much money as the director .
and if it be not - if it be just one more example of the elaborate blair witch mythology - then that be the art of the shell game .
to invent both a fake documentary and a persuasive tale about how it be make : that be true witchcraft .

the mobile phone be set to become one of the central technology of the 21st century .
within a few year , the mobile phone will evolve into a multi-functional communicator capable of transmit and receive not only sound , but also video , still image , datum and text .
a whole new era of personal communication be on the way .
thanks in part to the growth of wireless network , the telephone be converge with the personal computer and the television .
soon lightweight phone outfit with high-resolution screen will be connect to satellite enable people to talk , send and receive e-mail , or take part in video conference anytime , anywhere .
these phone might also absorb many of the key function of the desktop computer .
mobile device be expect to be ideal for some of the new personalized service that be become available via the internet , such as trading stock , gambling , shopping and buy theater and airline ticket .
the telecommunications revolution be already take shape around the globe .
in europe , mobile phone be already be use for electronic commerce .
most phone contain a subscriber identification module ( sim ) card to identify a user to the phone network .
but the card could also facilitate limited financial transaction .
deutsche bank and nokia , for example , be work together to develop mobile banking service .
some manufacturer plan to upgrade the sim card to a all-in-one personal identification credit card .
another approach be to add a slot to mobile phone for a second smart card design for mobile e-commerce .
these card could be use to make payment over the internet or to pay for thing like public transportation , movie ticket or drink at a bar .
in france , motorola and france telecom be currently test a dual slot phone , the startac d , while in finland nokia be test a phone that use a special plug-in reader for a tiny smart card .
since it be not yet clear whether it be best to do everything with a single device , siemens be develop dual slot phone and a new product call einstein .
the latter be a device equip with a smart card reader and keypad that can be link to the phone via infrared wireless technology .
it will soon be possible to receive almost all form of electronic communication through a single device , most likely in a three-in-one phone that serve as a cordless at home , a cell phone on the road and a intercom at work .
" the mobile phone will become increasingly multi-functional , " say burghardt schallenberger , vice president for technology and innovation at siemens information and consumer products in munich .
" fingerprint technology and advance speech recognition will ensure that only one or two authorize user will be able to operate it . "
new device , such as nokia 's 9110 communicator , a combination phone and personal digital assistant ( pda ) , be almost ready on the market .
but some customer feel the keyboard and screen be too small and too complex for comfort .
to get around these problem , nokia 's 7110 mobile phone have a larger screen and be operate by a tracking ball in addition to a keyboard .
the phone have a market among young people , who tend to send more text message than they make mobile phone call because text be less expensive .
ericsson be research a " smart quill " pen .
a pen appear like any other , but permit writer to write on any surface - or even in the air - while a microchip in the tip of the pen record the shape of the scribbling and transmit they to a remote pc , where special software convert they into normal text .
could this mean the end of typing ?
not yet .
ericsson can not say when a prototype will be ready .
speech recognition software might eventually make keyboard unnecessary .
the philips genie , a lightweight mobile phone , can be operate by utter a single word .
when you type a name into the genie 's keypad , the system ask whether you would like to assign a voice-dial tag to that name .
through " yes " or " no " prompt , the genie compile a list of up to 10 voice tag .
the next time you want to call a person list as one of these tag , just say that person 's name or a relevant code word .
until mobile phone become more sophisticated , they will face competition from p.d.a.s. american firm palm computing , part of 3com , have release its palm vii .
palm computing have create a fast internet message service for the palm vii by build the personal query assistant , a service allow access to specially cut-down internet site which provide datum such as flight schedule , sport score , weather forecast and news headline .
the device will be able to handle transaction like book cinema ticket or make online stock trade .
similarly , cnn and nokia have join force to create the first 24-hour global news hotline , cnn mobile , which provide global system for mobile communication ( gsm ) customer with break news .
while some prefer mobile phone and p.d.a.s. in a single unit , swedish manufacturer ericsson believe that if build separately , they can offer more flexibility .
ericsson 's " advance mobile companion , " the mc218 , a small communicator with a full-size keyboard , use a infrared modem to enable e-mail , fax , short message service ( sm ) message and internet access via any ericsson gsm mobile phone and mobile network subscription .
yet , to many , datum transmission via mobile phone and p.d.a.s be agonizingly slow .
at present , gsm phone can transmit datum only at speed of 9.6 . kilobit per second - compare with the 56 kilobit per second web browse capability find in many pc modem .
but in europe sometime during 2000 a faster system know as general packet radio services will enable mobile to send many packet of datum simultaneiously , allow information to be transmit at 115 kilobit per second , increase within a few year to 384 kilobit per second .
eventually , a common transmission system know as universal mobile telecoms system ( u.m.t.s. ) will propel information at speed around 2,000 kilobit per second , or 40 time faster than today 's modem .
this will make possible video conference with excellent picture quality , fast mobile net surfing and the transmission of e-mail with large file attachment .
but how will mobile phone communicate with other digital device such as household appliance ?
through bluetooth , a wireless standard that allow electronic device to communicate over distance shorter than its 10m range .
already accept as a common protocol by more than 500 electronics manufacturer , bluetooth will be install in over 80 % of mobile phone by 2001 .
soon , this technology could allow you to make adjustment to you central heating , operate you stereo or check the oil in you car via you mobile phone .
but even when u.m.t.s. become widely establish , many nation will still have poor coverage outside main urban district .
satellite communication still provide the only feasible method of link people in remote location together .
but why not combine a surface-link phone with a satellite link ?
one satellite communication provider , london-based ico global communications , be already use cheap terrestrial link around urban area , then switch instantly to satellite when the caller enter a remote area .
image will be just as important as sound to the future of mobile communication .
at british telecom 's research laboratory near ipswich , england , engineer be evaluate how a tiny screen fit to the side-frame of a pair of ordinary glass can be link to the human eye .
jerry bowskill , senior research scientist at bt , recently wear just such a portable micro-pc connect to he glass for a three-month period to experience the problem and benefit such device might produce .
the micro-pc be carry in a shoulder bag and connect to a tiny screen in the glass frame .
the pc accept incoming datum in standard tv format via a aerial and convert it into pc format image .
the image on the screen be reflect onto the human eye via a prism fit onto the lens .
" the image quality be excellent , " say bowskill .
" it have the same resolution as a pc desktop screen .
and even though the image be 2.5 cm away from you eye , it look as if you be stare at a screen one meter away . "
within a few year , he predict , " we might all be wear these glass . "
a person wear such glass could be on the move while stay tune in to incoming tv image , website , video conferencing link or e-mail message .
in germany , siemens be develop a cordless video telephone that include a tiny camera and a high-resolution pixel color display design around the digital enhance cordless telecommunication radio system .
it can transmit at around 64 kilobit - more than six time faster than current datum transmission rate for mobile phone .
" this mean that the videophone can send sufficient datum to allow 10 frame per second , " say karlheinz groebmainz , siemens ' munich-based project spokesman for the cordless video telephone .
this rate would compare favorably with video tape , which operate at rate between 25 and 30 frame per second .
use a earpiece , caller hold the phone at arm 's length to maintain visual contact .
alternatively , the phone can be point at something else - the taj mahal , for example - to allow the person on the other end to view it .
some even suggest that mobile videophone could overtake television as the major source of visual information , give the phrase " something to phone home about " a whole new meaning .
ca not program a computer ?
not techno savvy ?
not a problem .
if you have get a hot internet business idea , silicon valley 's astonishing start-up machine will do the rest .
there be something oddly charming about the geek who make up the first wave of internet entrepreneur .
social misfit pound out code in they computer-science lab - these people deserve professional success .
during the summer of 1999 , however , come the second wave : fast-talking business-school grad whose interest in technology be limit to how it will make they money .
this be silicon valley in the ipo age .
geek be history ; they be all capitalist now .
all it take to launch the next internet success be a neat idea , a few connection and a lot of luck .
it be not all about the money .
if you be a eager 28-year-old business-school graduate and you believe the internet be go to be bigger than the industrial revolution , why not try to become henry ford ?
if you be a entrepreneur , why waste you time in the old world , worry about manufacture thing when you can put you company online in three month ?
why have a boss when you and three buddy can build you own publicly trade company in two year ?
windows this big do not open that often .
that be a big reason people be flock to the valley , from wall street and moscow and bombay .
but mostly , it be the money .
for a few week now , i ' ve want a pair of new sneaker .
i be dream of a shoe that be fashionable but not club-kid trendy , maybe something high tech and modern like a nike air max , or perhaps something vintage but cool like thick-striped adidas .
i think about these sneaker when i be watch mtv and i flip through fashion magazine .
i be convince that these shoe will change , if not my life , certainly my attitude .
i be , quite obviously , ready to buy .
should the right retailer match i up with the right pair of shoe , the retailer and i will both go home happy .
could that retailer be online ?
though i have begin to suspect it be , james twitchell do not think so .
twitchell , a university of florida professor and author of several book about american consumer culture , believe online shopping will never replace the act of buy something in a store .
recently , as a part of he research while do a book about luxury , twitchell ( who do not like off-line shopping either ) manage to drag himself into the chic ralph lauren store on madison avenue in new york city .
a three-story fake mansion , the store present not just ralph lauren clothes but a entire lifestyle as well .
something strange happen to professor twitchell there : he want to buy a tie .
" there i be , run my hand through the tie .
now , i hate this place , " twitchell remind i , " but i feel this gasp inside i because i want one of those tie . "
this be why he feel the online shopping experience be simply unable to give consumer that twinge of irrational desire to make a purchase that twitchell call the " buchanan moment " .
this experience be name for the moment in f. scott fitzgerald 's classic american novel the great gatsby when a overwhelming flood of desire seize heroine daisy buchanan when jay gatsby unveil to she a sensual cascade of finely make shirt .
e-shopping must satisfy some desire however .
consumer spend $ 700 million online in 1996 , as contrast with $ 7 billion in 1988 .
they be expect to spend more than twice as much during 2000 , accord to the technology consulting firm jupiter communications .
one reason for this be clear ; comparison shopping have never be easier thanks to such business as priceline.com and eloan and service like mysimon that will search the web look for the best price .
in addition , almost anything you might want to buy be available on-line today .
but in area in which product vary widely within a category , and decision be base not just on price but also on , for example , how well something fit or whether it will go with those pants you just buy , online shopping be still lack .
which bring i back to my shoe .
it in fact bring we to the footlocker 's new web-site , the footlocker megastore ( www.footlocker.com ) .
they offer i 110 different shoe to consider , and that be after i narrow my search to woman 's casual footwear .
the shoe and i just sort of stare at each from we separate side of the computer screen .
it be not just that i can not feel these shoe , it be that i can not get a feel for they .
what kind of person wear these pumas ?
would they look ok with blue jeans ?
we decision be not entirely rational .
in the book why we buy , retail anthropologist paco underhill use extensive study of shopper ' behavior to prove shopping can be influence by a variety of seemingly extraneous factor .
these influence range from the number of mirror in a store to whether the aisle be wide enough to avoid embarrassing shopper collision .
it be all these factor that brick and mortar store use to convince we to buy once we be inside they .
to cover the cost of do business they must have a " sell-through rate " of around 50 % , the percentage of those who buy to those who come to look .
by contrast , the highest of any online retailer be only 7 % .
e-commerce site will have to address the problem of turn shopper into buyer if they want to move far beyond they current niche .
that be why the next-generation online retailer be try to figure out how to improve the process of shopping .
they be create site that try to reflect the feeling and experience of actually be in a store .
and they be try to create a electronic environment that either produce a daisy buchanan moment or bring into existence its equivalent .
we be already see low-cost , modest attempt at this .
the popular site wine.com use e-mail and chat room to encourage a kind of electronic wine-tasting party .
and this past holiday season , at least two company - liveperson and peoplesupport - provide many major retailer with the technology they need to give they customer instant-message-style interaction with live , online sale person .
even more interesting , however , be boo.com , a sport-and-lifestyle-clothing retailer that open its electronic door in september , 1999 .
the website feature 3-d computer graphic image of product sample you could " pick up " and turn around to examine from all angle .
cooler still , it offer one of the first attempt at a virtual personal shopper ( she be name " ms. boo " and " dress room , " where one can wrap outfit around a kind of 3-d paper doll .
along with the actual product be news article on popular sport athlete and snapshot of savvy twenty-year-old from around the globe to give context to the clothes for sale .
you get a sense of not just what boo.com have for sale but also who else besides you might be buy there .
as i sit face a computer screen and enjoy play with the cool 360 degree view rotation of several different pair of shoe , i find that something strange happen .
i actually want to buy a pair of converse road rage shoe , in lime green .

nissan 's plan to fire 221,000 worker may indicate a tough new approach in japanese business culture
in february , 1999 , nissan motor take the radical step of put itself up for sale .
at that time , chief executive yoshikazu hanawa be ask whether he would consider break japan inc. 's long-standing taboo and fire worker to cut cost .
he answer : " we will handle the employment issue carefully . "
near the end of october , 1999 , nissan , japan 's second largest carmaker , announce that it would shut five plant , cut tie to hundred of supplier , and - gasp ! - let go of 21,000 worker .
hanawa 's explanation : " we do not have other alternative .
to survive , we must do this . "
hanawa be not the only japanese business leader to make radical change .
a number of high-profile corporation have say they will fire staff , shed supplier and sell subsidiary .
two large bank , sakura and sumitomo , will merge after decade of fierce rivalry .
they announce that they will eliminate 9,300 job .
such radical change strike at tradition that many japanese hold sacred .
these tradition include lifetime employment for all worker and the cozy network of interlock business and bank know as keiretsu .
it be too early to call this a full-scale revolution : there be still plenty of people who follow and support the old way .
in october , 1999 prime minister keizo obuchi warn nissan that it should think hard about the impact of its drastic cost-cutting program on worker and subcontractor .
some suggest that hanawa himself be a reluctant reformer .
they say that he have be force to take action by nissan 's new partner , the french car maker , renault .
" only a foreigner could make such change , " say yukio noguchi , a economist at the university of tokyo .
" no japanese could solve the problem because of the keiretsu and its employee . "
the chairman of rival auto-maker toyota , hiroshi okuda , predict nissan 's far-reaching plan will be difficult to accomplish .
" company that fire employee simply because of a economic downturn will lose the trust of worker and eventually lose the competitive edge , " he tell the japanese press .
one can forgive the doubter .
promise of reform have be make repeatedly before .
script for a " new japan " have be write and re-written .
" in japan , everything continue for as long as it can continue , " say akio mikuni , president of a credit-rating company .
indeed , there be still structural obstacle to a dramatic overhaul of japan 's corporation .
accounting system be not easily understand , bankruptcy law be inadequate , the judicial process be slow .
and , astonishing as it may sound , japan simply do not have enough accountant or lawyer to cope with massive corporate restructuring .
" the pace be pick up , " sy brian rose , senior economist at warburg dillon read in tokyo .
he expect the merger to trigger something of a domino effect .
as bank consolidate , the keiretsu will disintegrate .
stronger company will no longer need to rely on ally bank for capital .
weaker firm will find themselves without bank to depend on .
if that scenario occur , it will mean a end to way of do business that date back to the early part of the 20th century .
say economist noguchi , " the problem be , the technology change but we system do not . "
the keiretsu face they biggest threat yet , the internet , as manufacturer worldwide be start to click directly on to supply route that be fast , cheap and eliminate middle man .
in recent year , japanese company have repeatedly choose to shield one another from the need to change .
the keiretsu tend to protect they money-losing business .
nissan be a good example .
it have be use barely half of its manufacturing capacity and yet support a large network of supplier that have little incentive to offer competitive price .
despite decline market share and sale , nobody dare change the system , despite its stunning inefficiency .
keiretsuty be extensive and touch every part of the life of a group 's employee .
at sumitomo bank , for example , staff be encourage to drink only asahi beer because the brewery be in its keiretsu .
the decline of these group be be hasten by powerful new force .
foreigner be now allow to invest in long shield sector of the japanese economy , like brokerage , bank and insurance company .
a invasion of the financial sector be also under way .
japanese worker have need for concern .
unemployment have reach a post-war high of 5 % , and large-scale layoff have just begin .
some company man be not wait for the inevitable .
yasufumi takahashi , a trader in precious metal at nissho iwai , have enrol in a class to study financial planning .
the trading house suffer huge loss last year , slash salary and announce it would cut at least 1,000 employee - nearly one fourth of its workforce - by march 2002 .
takahashi , 31 , see he income fall 20 % .
he fear it might drop further and that he may even lose he job - hence the financial-planning course .
" i think i would work here a long time , " he say .
" but there have be a lot of bankruptcy , merger and acquisition , foreign investor come in .
the situation in japan have to change . "
at nissan , it already have .
