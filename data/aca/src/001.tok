the first part of man
chapter i of sense
concern the thought of man , i will consider they first singly , and afterwards in train or dependence upon one another .
singly , they be every one a representation or appearance of some quality , or other accident of a body without we , which be commonly call a object .
which object worketh on the eye , ear , and other part of man 's body , and by diversity of work produceth diversity of appearance .
the original of they all be that which we call sense , ( for there be no conception in a man 's mind which have not at first , totally or by part , be beget upon the organ of sense ) .
the rest be derive from that original .
to know the natural cause of sense be not very necessary to the business now in hand ; and i have elsewhere write of the same at large .
nevertheless , to fill each part of my present method , i will briefly deliver the same in this place .
the cause of sense be the external body , or object , which presseth the organ proper to each sense , either immediately , as in the taste and touch ; or mediately , as in see , hearing , and smell : which pressure , by the mediation of nerve and other string and membrane of the body , continue inwards to the brain and heart , causeth there a resistance , or counter-pressure , or endeavour of the heart to deliver itself : which endeavour , because outward , seemeth to be some matter without .
and this seeming , or fancy , be that which man call sense ; and consisteth , as to the eye , in a light , or colour figure ; to the ear , in a sound ; to the nostril , in a odour ; to the tongue and palate , in a savour ; and to the rest of the body , in heat , cold , hardness , softness , and such other quality as we discern by feeling .
all which quality call sensible be in the object that causeth they but so many several motion of the matter , by which it presseth we organ diversely .
neither in we that be press be they anything else but diverse motion ( for motion produceth nothing but motion ) .
but they appearance to we be fancy , the same waking that dream .
and as press , rub , or strike the eye make we fancy a light , and press the ear produceth a din ; so do the body also we see , or hear , produce the same by they strong , though unobserved action .
for if those colour and sound be in the body or object that cause they , they could not be sever from they , as by glass and in echo by reflection we see they be : where we know the thing we see be in one place ; the appearance , in another .
and though at some certain distance the real and very object seem invest with the fancy it beget in we ; yet still the object be one thing , the image or fancy be another .
so that sense in all case be nothing else but original fancy cause ( as i have say ) by the pressure that be , by the motion of external thing upon we eye , ear , and other organ , thereunto ordain .
but the philosophy school , through all the university of christendom , ground upon certain text of aristotle , teach another doctrine ; and say , for the cause of vision , that the thing see sendeth forth on every side a visible species , ( in english ) a visible show , apparition , or aspect , or a be see ; the receive whereof into the eye be see .
and for the cause of hearing , that the thing hear sendeth forth a audible species , that be , a audible aspect , or audible be see ; which , enter at the ear , maketh hearing .
nay , for the cause of understanding also , they say the thing understand sendeth forth a intelligible species , that be , a intelligible be see ; which , come into the understanding , make we understand .
i say not this , as disapprove the use of university : but because i be to speak hereafter of they office in a commonwealth , i must let you see on all occasion by the way what thing would be amend in they ; amongst which the frequency of insignificant speech be one .
chapter ii of imagination
that when a thing lie still , unless somewhat else stir it , it will lie still for ever , be a truth that no man doubt of .
but that when a thing be in motion , it will eternally be in motion , unless somewhat else stay it , though the reason be the same ( namely , that nothing can change itself ) , be not so easily assent to .
for man measure , not only other man , but all other thing , by themselves : and because they find themselves subject after motion to pain and lassitude , think everything else grow weary of motion , and seek repose of its own accord ; little consider whether it be not some other motion wherein that desire of rest they find in themselves consisteth .
from hence it be that the school say , heavy body fall downward out of a appetite to rest , and to conserve they nature in that place which be most proper for they ; ascribe appetite , and knowledge of what be good for they conservation ( which be more than man have ) , to thing inanimate , absurdly .
when a body be once in motion , it moveth ( unless something else hinder it ) eternally ; and whatsoever hindreth it , can not in a instant , but in time , and by degree , quite extinguish it : and as we see in the water , though the wind cease , the wave give not over roll for a long time after ; so also it happeneth in that motion which be make in the internal part of a man , then , when he see , dream , etc. .
for after the object be remove , or the eye shut , we still retain a image of the thing see , though more obscure than when we see it .
and this be it the latins call imagination , from the image make in see , and apply the same , though improperly , to all the other sens .
but the greeks call it fancy , which signify appearance , and be as proper to one sense as to another .
imagination , therefore , be nothing but decay sense ; and be find in man and many other live creature , as well sleep as waking .
the decay of sense in man wake be not the decay of the motion make in sense , but a obscuring of it , in such manner as the light of the sun obscureth the light of the star ; which star do no less exercise they virtue by which they be visible in the day than in the night .
but because amongst many stroke which we eye , ear , and other organ receive from external body , the predominant only be sensible ; therefore the light of the sun be predominant , we be not affect with the action of the star .
and any object be remove from we eye , though the impression it make in we remain , yet other object more present succeed , and work on we , the imagination of the past be obscure and make weak , as the voice of a man be in the noise of the day .
from whence it followeth that the longer the time be , after the sight or sense of any object , the weaker be the imagination .
for the continual change of man 's body destroy in time the part which in sense be move : so that distance of time , and of place , have one and the same effect in we .
for as at a great distance of place that which we look at appear dim , and without distinction of the smaller part , and as voice grow weak and inarticulate : so also after great distance of time we imagination of the past be weak ; and we lose , for example , of city we have see , many particular street ; and of action , many particular circumstance .
this decaying sense , when we would express the thing itself ( i mean fancy itself ) , we call imagination , as i say before .
but when we would express the decay , and signify that the sense be fading , old , and past , it be call memory .
so that imagination and memory be but one thing , which for diverse consideration have diverse name .
much memory , or memory of many thing , be call experience .
again , imagination be only of those thing which have be formerly perceive by sense , either all at once , or by part at several time ; the former ( which be the imagine the whole object , as it be present to the sense ) be simple imagination , as when one imagineth a man , or horse , which he have see before .
the other be compound , when from the sight of a man at one time , and of a horse at another , we conceive in we mind a centaur .
so when a man compoundeth the image of he own person with the image of the action of another man , as when a man imagine himself a hercules or a alexander ( which happeneth often to they that be much take with reading of romance ) , it be a compound imagination , and properly but a fiction of the mind .
there be also other imagination that rise in man , though wake , from the great impression make in sense : as from gaze upon the sun , the impression leave a image of the sun before we eye a long time after ; and from be long and vehemently attent upon geometrical figure , a man shall in the dark , though awake , have the image of line and angle before he eye ; which kind of fancy have no particular name , as be a thing that doth not commonly fall into man 's discourse .
the imagination of they that sleep be those we call dream .
and these also ( as all other imagination ) have be before , either totally or by parcel , in the sense .
and because in sense , the brain and nerve , which be the necessary organ of sense , be so benumb in sleep as not easily to be move by the action of external object , there can happen in sleep no imagination , and therefore no dream , but what proceeds from the agitation of the inward part of man 's body ; which inward part , for the connexion they have with the brain and other organ , when they be distemper do keep the same in motion ; whereby the imagination there formerly make , appear as if a man be wake ; save that the organ of sense be now benumb , so as there be no new object which can master and obscure they with a more vigorous impression , a dream must need be more clear , in this silence of sense , than be we wake thought .
and hence it cometh to pass that it be a hard matter , and by many think impossible , to distinguish exactly between sense and dream .
for my part , when i consider that in dream i do not often nor constantly think of the same person , place , object , and action that i do wake , nor remember so long a train of coherent thought dream as at other time ; and because wake i often observe the absurdity of dream , but never dream of the absurdity of my wake thought , i be well satisfied that , be awake , i know i dream not ; though when i dream , i think myself awake .
and see dream be cause by the distemper of some of the inward part of the body , diverse distemper must need cause different dream .
and hence it be that lie cold breedeth dream of fear , and raiseth the thought and image of some fearful object , the motion from the brain to the inner part , and from the inner part to the brain be reciprocal ; and that as anger causeth heat in some part of the body when we be awake , so when we sleep the overheating of the same part causeth anger , and raiseth up in the brain the imagination of a enemy .
in the same manner , as natural kindness when we be awake causeth desire , and desire make heat in certain other part of the body ; so also too much heat in those part , while we sleep , raiseth in the brain a imagination of some kindness show .
“ we be not equip to answer ”
what of the future ?
over the course of a generation the holocaust have move from the margin to the center of american jewish consciousness ; from a event that rarely appear in american public discourse to one that be omnipresent .
will the holocaust , one or two generation down the road , loom as large as it do now ?
will its centrality prove short-lived ?
these be not question that anyone can answer with confidence , but look at the idea of collective memory in general , and at what be happen so far with the memory of the holocaust in particular , may offer a few clue .
some collective memory be very longlived the battle of kosovo for serbs , the expulsion of 1492 for sephardic jews .
the reason that these memory endure for century be that the condition they symbolize also endure : foreign oppression , foreign exile .
long-lived memory be most characteristic of stable , relatively unchanging society .
when we speak of collective memory , we often forget that we ’re employ a metaphoran organic metaphor that make a analogy between the memory of a individual and that of a community .
the metaphor work best when we ’re speaking of a organic ( traditional , stable , homogeneous ) community in which consciousness , like social reality , change slowly .
when maurice halbwachs first advance the idea of collective memory in the 1920s , the great french medievalist marc bloch , who be suspicious of organic metaphor for society , nevertheless think it might be usefully apply to such thing as a peasant grandparent , grandchild on knee , pass on rural tradition .
a very organic image .
how appropriate the metaphor be for the very inorganic society of the late twentieth century ( fragmented rather than homogeneous , rapidly change rather than stable , the principal mode of communication electronic rather than face to face ) seem to i questionable .
the life expectancy of memory in today ’s society appear greatly diminish .
with the circumstance of we life change as rapidly as they do , it be the rare memory that can connect with a unchanging condition .
nowhere be this more true than in the united states , that notoriously most " now ” and amnesiac of nation .
year ago , the fourth of july be a day when the community gather to hear patriotic speech .
when be the last time you go to a patriotic speech on the fourth of july ?
when be the last time you even think about the declaration of independence , which it commemorate , on that day ?
“ the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here , but it can never forget what they do here . ”
but of course lincoln get it backward .
he word at gettysburg still ( perhaps , sometimes ) resonate ; not one american in a hundred have the faintest notion of the significance of the battle of gettysburg , or who win it .
november 11 use to be armistice day , on which we pay homage to a memory ; now it ’s veterans day , on which we pay homage to a interest group .
some of my colleague continue to be shock that incoming freshman know nothing of such “ ancient history ” as the vietnam war and watergate .
my colleague acknowledge grudgingly , because it make they feel old that these thing happen before the student be bear , but protest that the kid ’ parent live through they ; “ they must have tell they about it ” !
maybe the parent do , but the kid do n’t ( as kid do n’t ) listen .
we ’re a long way from traditional notion of the transmission of collective memory , let alone the sort that endure for century .
whether or not we want to call it memory , consciousness of the holocaust have grow enormously over the last generation most notably among american jews , more diffusely among all americans .
what do the process by which that growth take place suggest about “ the future of the holocaust ” ?
much of the original impetus behind the jewish drive for center the holocaust be , if not spend , at least decline in power .
those who once complain , with justification , that the holocaust have be neglect , and that it be necessary to counteract that neglect , have surely succeed in they task , and the complaint no longer have any force .
as we ’ve see , holocaust awareness be promote to mobilize support for a beleaguered israel , picture as be in a kind of pre-holocaust danger .
such argument be rarely hear anymore and would be unlikely to attract many adherent if they be hear .
though the chance for a mutually satisfactory accommodation between israelis and palestinians remain in doubt , it ’s hard to imagine the circumstance in which israel ’s problem will summon up image of the holocaust .
in the early seventy there be a good deal of talk about a rampant “ new anti-semitism ” in america , of the need to remind both jews and gentile of the holocaust in order to combat it .
i ’ve argue that at the time claim about a new anti-semitism be nonsense ; certainly they ’re nonsense today .
while anti-semite will probably always be with we , they influence , insignificant twenty-five year ago , be even more insignificant now .
a number of those who take the lead in promote holocaust awareness be move by the belief that it call for a reorientation of jewish religious belief and practice .
this view have fail to win much support , and its power seem to be wane .
rabbi irving greenberg be perhaps the single most influential figure in center the holocaust in jewish and general american consciousness , through the private commemorative activity he sponsor and through he service as director of president carter ’s commission on the holocaust .
for greenberg , as we ’ve see , the holocaust be a “ revelational event ” on a par with receive the torah at mount sinai .
as jews ritually eat matzo to commemorate the exodus , he urge they to ritually eat rotten potato peeling to commemorate the holocaust .
greenberg argue that just as the destruction of the temple bring forth the new institution of the synagogue , so the destruction of european jewry be bring forth another new religious institution , the holocaust museum .
but most of the jewish religious establishment have resist the effort of greenberg , emil fackenheim , and other who seek to win for the holocaust a major place in formal jewish liturgy and theology .
for ismar schorsch , head of the jewish theological seminary ( conservative ) , the holocaust be “ a theological ‘ black hole ’ so dense that it fail to emit even a single ray of light .
a collapse star can never serve as a source of illumination . ”
representative of other segment of american judaism have be equally oppose to see the holocaust center in jewish religious belief , and nowadays there be few press this cause .
in a broad sense the holocaust remain sacred in american “ folk judaism ” , especially among the less observant , and this be likely to continue in the short term .
whether this will endure without formal religious institutionalization be hard to say .
the argument for raise holocaust consciousness that have be advance with the greatest urgency be , by any sober evaluation , the most absurd : the alleged necessity of respond to the tiny band of crank , kook , and misfit who deny that the holocaust take place .
concern about the “ grow influence ” of this corporal ’s guard be widespread for a time , but now seem to be abate .
the “ star ” of american holocaust denial be arthur butz , a associate professor of electrical engineering at northwestern university , who in 1976 arrange the private publication of the hoax of the twentieth century : the case against the presumed extermination of european jewry .
a few year later the institute for historical review be establish in california ; its principal activity be publish the journal of historical review , a slender quarterly devote to expose “ the myth of the six million ” .
the institute rent the mailing list of the unsuspecting organization of american historians , and send sample copy of its journal to the organization ’s twelve thousand member , garner some publicity from the result reaction .
more publicity come when its offer of a $ 50,000 reward for anyone who could prove any jews be gas at auschwitz be take up by mel mermelstein , a survivor of that camp ; after bring a lawsuit , he collect .
the denier ’ most successful publicity coup be they clever idea of send college newspaper advertisement call for “ open debate ” on the holocaust .
a series of fuss be occasion by several undergraduate editor ’ notion that reject the ad raise “ first amendment issue ” .
this keep the pot boil , though in no case know to i be the holocaust itself ever debate on campus ; rather , it be a question of whether boycott or exposure be the best strategy for deal with these screwball .
so far as one can tell , it be only fellow screwball that they ever attract : john hinckley , who shoot president reagan , be a denier ; so be eric rudolph , at this write want for the murder of a guard at a abortion clinic ; so be the crazed chess genius bobby fischer .
the activity of these fruitcake be irritating , indeed infuriate especially , though not exclusively , to survivor .
some insist that the denier should be take more seriously , but since there be no evidence that they ’d have the slightest influence , it be hard to say why one should do so .
then seemingly powerful evidence of the denier ’ influence be supply by a public opinion poll conduct for the american jewish committee by the roper organization .
its result be announce on the eve of the opening of the washington holocaust museum in 1993 .
twenty-two percent of the public , accord to the poll , doubt that the holocaust have really occur .
“ what have we do ?
twenty-two percent ... oh , my god , ” say elie wieselan understandable reaction to this astonishing statistic , and one echo in the press across the country .
come on the eve of the museum opening , the poll finding be cite in newspaper editorial and other commentary as the decisive argument for its indispensability , a unanswerable response to those who have doubt that such a museum belong in the united states .
deborah lipstadt ’s deny the holocaust : the grow assault on truth and memory arrive in bookstore at the same time as the poll result be announce .
it be the rare review of lipstadt ’s book that do n’t cite the poll as proof that the denier have indeed have the success lipstadt attribute to they .
for the next several month the grow menace of the denier and the evidence of they astonishing influence offer by the roper poll be repeatedly discuss .
the poll result be say to underscore the importance not only of the washington museum but of spielberg ’s schindler ’s list in check the denier menace .
steven spielberg himself say that he have fear , during the making of the movie , that if he make any mistake , it would help the denier .
all of this coincide with the height of the onslaught against american university as hotbed of nihilism and relativism .
lipstadt , in she book , claim that the willingness of campus editor to run denier ’ advertisement be evidence of the strength of postmodernism and deconstructionism in the university .
this theme be eagerly pick up by conservative commentator still another lesson , though this time not of the holocaust but of its denial .
( in fact , the student editor in question have not be immerse themselves in foucault and derrida , but instead reading , somewhat carelessly , those “ dead white male ” thomas jefferson and john stuart mill , and conclude that they principle require make a place in the marketplace of idea for the denier . )
it be a different sort of marketplace that “ deconstructed ” the roper poll result .
official of the gallup polling organization roper ’s main competitor be strike by the fact that the question that produce the astonishing 22 percent who doubt the holocaust have , against all the rule of survey research , be frame in a extraordinarily confusing way : “ do it seem possible or do it seem impossible to you that the nazi extermination of the jews never happen . ”
seize this opportunity to show up a rival ’s incompetence , the gallup people ask one sample group the original roper question and present another group with a straightforward version .
the version contain the double negative again produce dramatically high result .
1 academic freedom
in the spring of 1977 , columbia university announce that it would offer henry kissinger a special chair in international relation amply endow with fund for staff support and research .
in the week that follow , many student and professor vigorously protest the appointment , cite dr. kissinger 's involvement in the bombing of hanoi , the invasion of cambodia , and the prolongation of the vietnam war .
eventually , the controversy die when kissinger declare that he be not prepare to accept columbia 's offer .
but the episode leave a number of issue unresolved .
dr. kissinger 's attacker insist that they be not violate he academic freedom by object to action that he take as secretary of state .
and yet , be columbia at liberty to reject dr. kissinger 's appointment on the basis of policy he have earlier espouse , simply because he advocate they not as a scholar , but as a public servant ?
should the administration have agree to pass a moral judgment on those policy on the ground that they be no mere opinion but view translate into decision cause death and destruction to thousand of people ?
in consider a faculty appointment , should the university evaluate a candidate 's behavior in public office if the action involve matter , such as the bombing of hanoi , that bear no clear relation to he field of scholarly competence ?
these question remind we that dispute over academic freedom have not disappear .
in fact , they have grow more complicated in a age when faculty member have become involve with important controversy in the " real world . "
such problem deserve thoughtful consideration , since they bear directly on the way a university function and the value that underlie its intellectual activity .
the case for academic freedom
freedom of expression , in all its form , can be justify on two fundamental grounds .
for the individual , the right to speak and write as one choose be a form of liberty that contribute in important way to a rich and stimulating life .
to be deprive of such liberty be to lose the chance to participate fully in a intellectual exchange that help to develop one 's value , to make one 's meaning of the world , to exercise those quality of mind and imagination that be most distinctively human .
beyond its significance to the individual , freedom of speech have traditionally be regard in this country as important to the welfare of society .
throughout history , much progress have occur through growth in we understanding of ourselves , we institution , and the environment in which we live .
but experience teach we that major discovery and advance in knowledge be often highly unsettling and distasteful to the exist order .
only rarely do individual have the intelligence and imagination to conceive such idea and the courage to express they openly .
if we wish to stimulate progress , we can not afford to inhibit such person by impose orthodoxy , censorship , and other artificial barrier to creative thought .
these reason provide the intellectual foundation for the guarantee set forth in the first amendment of we constitution .
even so , we must acknowledge that we commitment to free speech be more a matter of faith than a product of logic or empirical demonstration .
it be always possible that the exercise of this liberty will produce mistake and misperception that will mislead the public and actually result in harmful policy .
in contrast to many other country , however , ours have elect to guard against these danger not by censorship , but by encourage open discussion in which idea can be subject to criticism and error can be correct through continue argument and debate .
university should be unreserved in support these principle , since freedom of expression be critical to they central mission .
this point deserve a word of elaboration , for now that university have become more involve in the society and more important to its development , they have acquire different constituency that view they purpose in somewhat different way .
to parent and student , university be chiefly place where young people can obtain a education and spend several pleasant , intellectually stimulate year .
to the learn calling , university be the locus of lead professional school that select able student and train they to serve as competent practitioner .
to the government , university be vehicle to help achieve social goal , such as equal opportunity for minority , as well as important source of sophisticated knowledge need for defense , foreign policy , medicine , and technological development .
to corporate and foundation executive , along with public official , university be also valuable repository of expertise from which to gain advice in address complicated question .
though all of these perception be accurate , we could probably obtain most of the service mention without have to create a university .
for example , independent college could provide a excellent undergraduate education , as many of they do already .
separate institution could be form to offer professional training adequate to meet we practical need .
and consult organization could supply the specialized advice and analysis that public agency and other institution so often seek .
while the various function of the university could be reorganize and redistribute in this fashion , something important would be lose .
neither college , nor consult organization , nor professional training school can satisfy society 's need for new knowledge and discovery .
true , one could look to some sort of research institute to perform this function .
but even this alternative would not wholly replace what university can supply .
it be the special function of the university to combine education with research , and knowledgeable observer believe that this combination have distinct advantage both for teaching and for science and scholarship .
experience suggest that graduate student learn best from work directly with able and established professor actively engage in they own research , while the latter benefit in turn from the stimulation they derive from inquire young associate .
without the marriage of teaching and research that university uniquely provide , the conduct of scholarly inquiry and scientific investigation , as well as the progress of graduate training , would be unlikely to continue at the level of quality achieve over the past two generation .
in a society heavily dependent on advanced education and highly specialize knowledge , such a decline could be seriously detrimental to the public welfare .
if this unique combination of education and discovery be the chief contribution of the university , how can its progress be secure ?
apart from the library , laboratory , and other facility important to research , two ingredient be especially important .
the first of these be the ability to recruit the ablest and most creative people that can be attract into academic life .
the second critical element be a environment of freedom in which professor can do they work without constraint or external direction .
highly intelligent , imaginative people tend to resist order from above and do not do they best work under such condition .
even less desirable than centralized direction be the imposition of restraint on the kind of idea and hypothesis that scholar can publicly entertain , for such restriction stifle the spirit of venture some inquiry while block off entire field of investigation that seem threaten to those who have strong interest in maintain the status quo .
for these reason , academic freedom be not merely a reflection of society 's commitment to free speech ; it be a safeguard essential to the aim of the university and to the welfare of those who work within it .
teachers and scholar have a vital stake in continue to enjoy the liberty to speak and write as they choose , because they life be entirely devote to develop and expound idea .
university in turn have a critical interest in preserve free expression , for without that freedom they will be hamper in appoint the most creative scientist and scholar and will suffer from form of censorship that will jeopardize the search for knowledge and new discovery that represent they most distinctive contribution .
opposition to academic freedom
despite the force of these argument , attack upon academic freedom have continue over the year since the doctrine be proclaim in 1915 .
for several decade , the assault come chiefly from conservative group disturb by theory and idea that seem to undermine prevail orthodoxy .
more recently , however , the greatest challenge to free expression on the campus have come from student and faculty on the leave who have launch vigorous attack on professor involve in the vietnam war or in dispute over matter affect race .
for example , at least one academic association have condemn scholar for conduct research of a " racist " nature .
moreover , in a survey publish in 1976 , 11 percent of the professor who respond agree that " academic research on the genetic basis of difference in intelligence should not be permit , because it serve to sustain a fundamentally racist perspective , " and 18 percent support the proposition that such research " should be discourage because it can easily serve to reinforce racial prejudice . "
regardless of they political coloration , all attack on academic freedom rest upon a single rationale .
to opponent of free expression , idea be powerful ; they frequently affect public policy and be use to justify important decision .
as a result , misguided theory and specious argument can cause considerable harm .
grant , one can always try to counter such view with oppose argument .
yet only in science can error be disprove decisively , and even there fallacious theory may linger for decade before they be finally put to rest .
in matter of social policy , shoddy idea and dubious theory can persist indefinitely and be exploit by powerful people to justify inhumane and exploitative policy .
hence , those who advocate censorship will acknowledge the value of free speech but argue that there be time when particular theory and opinion threaten to produce such grievous harm that they must be suppress .
in present this view , opponent of academic freedom overlook two glaring weakness in they position .
in the first place , history reveal that those who try to stamp out heresy often make egregious mistake .
since the time of socrates , intellectual have be penalize under circumstance that seem embarrassing in retrospect .
professors have be dismiss or deny appointment for uphold the right to strike , for advocate racial integration , for refuse to testify before the house un-american activities committee , for support the recognition of communist china .
as note a figure as bertrand russell be bar from teaching at the city college of new york for propound " immoral and salacious doctrine " that seem to condone extramarital sex .
group that seek to impose they orthodoxy today will presumably concede these error , but will insist that they own opinion rest on firmer ground .
yet those who attack professor in the past must also have believe in the rightness of they cause .
insofar as we can tell , they action stem from a sincere belief that it would be harmful to student and to the public at large to employ teacher who express idea and support policy that seem at the time to be dangerously misguided .
despite these good intention , the result be often sadly mistaken , and we should be honest enough to acknowledge that similar error will occur if we begin to penalize professor for they moral , political , or economic belief .
the second fallacy in all attempt at censorship be the implicit assumption that only like-minded people will be able to decide which orthodoxy to impose .
banker and industrialist proceed on this premise at the turn of the century when business value predominate in the society .
radical seem to have act on the same assumption during the brief period in the late 1960 when they militant tactic threaten to push all opposition aside on campus across the country .
but history suggest that no faction can wield decisive influence indefinitely and that group with differ view will be ready to wage war against unpopular opinion whenever the opportunity arise .
it require no more than a decade to discover how grossly the radical overestimate they power and how quickly they be follow by fundamentalist group and conservative force intent on press they own value on television programming , school textbook , and other means of communication .
ironically , the very professor who disdain academic freedom only ten year ago could soon find themselves cling to the doctrine to protect themselves against the tide of conservative ideology .
behavioral scientist be first bring into the design process to shed light on the need of future occupant .
since psychologist have expert knowledge on the way in which people respond to light , color , and proportion , sociologist about the nature of social organization in neighborhood , and anthropologist on building as symbol and artifact , it be hope that they would be able to apply this knowledge to the design process .
this approach falter for a number of reason .
the finding collect in basic research could not be apply with any confidence .
color perception be one of the oldest topic in experimental psychology , but if a experimental psychologist be ask to specify the color that should be use in a bus station , the answer be likely to be vague and uncertain .
nor be research on space perception , another traditional research topic , useful for understand orientation in building and neighborhood .
sociologist have do considerable research on neighborhood network , but they finding be usually too general to assist the city planner .
need analysis go through several stage in its evolution and be still change .
at the outset , designer rely on need they infer or extrapolate from basic research study and from theory .
more recent approach have tend to dwell less upon infer need and more upon direct expression of people 's want , which be obtain through survey or by the involvement of user in the design process .
the relationship between need and want be full of pitfall for the unwary .
a need be something basic , fundamental , and endure , as in the need for shelter , sustenance , and social contact , while a want be a express preference , and thus be likely to be specific , transient , and more easily change , as in the desire for a particular brand of food or clothing style .
human need have traditionally be regard as more acceptable topic of study than want in the behavioral science .
the investigation of preference be consider to be a second-rate applied task , more akin to marketing than to serious scholarship .
this dual standard have its root in the platonic view that appearance be deceptive and ephemeral and that the important reality lie underneath .
however in some specific ease a firm distinction between need and want be difficult to maintain .
some architect and urban planner look to the behavioral science not for specific bit of information that could be apply on particular project but for general theory of human behavior that could be generalize to many setting .
some designer find what they want to know about perception in the writings of james j. gibson and rudolf arnheim ; about the desire for stimulation and variety in the work of d. o. hebb and daniel berlyne ; and about social life within neighborhood from herbert gans and louis wirth .
this interest in general theory remain strong today and co-exist with the desire for place-specific information .
a mutual learning regard what each can obtain from the other have occur in the dialogue between designer and behavioral scientist .
initially , architect complain that the social scientist ' answer be too general , tentative , and often come too late to be useful .
behavioral scientist criticize the architect ' query as be too specific , time-pressured , and deterministic in assume a direct connection between building element and behavioral pattern .
one of the most useful contribution that social scientist have make to design be to point out that design do not alone determine behavior .
even when it strongly influence how people behave , the effect be not direct but be mediate through psycho-social factor ; for example , different people will be affect differently by the same building , depend upon whether they be alone or in a group , happy or sad , or be visit for the first time or be accustom to the place .
eventually those designer who want to collaborate with behavioral scientist learn how to ask question that could be answer within the time frame , method , and datum base of the social science , and those behavioral scientist active in the collaboration learn to produce timely and relevant report .
all this take time and patience on everyone ’s part .
effective collaboration between people in different field , especially those as distinct in training and temperament as design and behavioral science , do not come easily .
need assessment survey
another approach to need analysis come not from basic research or from theory , but from marketing , and involve ask people what they want in the way of work or live space .
this blur the distinction between need and want , since it assume that people ’s response will bear some relationship to both .
study of express preference be of interest to the social scientist and useful to industry .
the value of such study increase if they identify the particular property inherent in the object on which the preference or rejection be base .
technically it would have be more accurate to title this chapter want analysis , but i have follow the conventional practice of discuss “ need ” , since , from a practical standpoint , need be more saleable than want .
manager be more likely to respond positively when they be tell that employee need something than when they be tell that employee want it .
the latter statement be likely to provoke the response , “ yes , we know they want it , but we can not a fiord to give it to they .
however , if we worker need it then that be another matter . ”
in some way this be a semantics game , more akin to diplomacy than science .
economist speak of actual behavior in the marketplace as “ reveal preference , ” meaning that the behavior of people in purchase goods and service reveal they want and preference .
this approach be not valid in mast design space that be not “ purchase ” by they occupant .
nor can people ’s attitude towards the architecture or interior layout be discern by how long they remain inside .
the failure of market mechanism to reveal preference and level of occupant satisfaction with design space create a niche for formal technique for gauge occupant response .
most designer claim to be meet market demand to some degree , but the distinctive feature of una ( user need analysis ) be that it be carry out in a systematic manner .
this require the use of standardized technique for collect information ( interview , questionnaire , and so on ) and some sampling of occupant and they activity .
without formal procedure for select people to be interview and way of ask question , the technique do not qualify as a una .
it be not always safe to assume that input from potential occupant of a setting will be more relevant to the design process than input from those in similar facility .
it may be that the potential occupant have never experience a building of the same type before .
for example , ask teacher and student in a traditional school building what they space and environmental need would be in a open-plan school building with modular pod housing three grade each may turn up little useful information , unless potential occupant be give some education or experience with open-plan school building .
consulting with potential occupant be always desirable when it be possible , both because of the possibility of secure useful information about the resident and they space need ， and because it will satisfy people ’s desire to be consult about change that affect they life .
a assumption in a need assessment survey be that potential occupant know what they want and can communicate this to a interviewer .
in case where people be turn off to they physical surroundings and alienate from the decision-making process , this assumption be not valid .
most people ask about civic improvement will respond hesitantly and tentatively .
they have not give much thought to these matter .
there be no reason for they to be concern since they opinion have not matter .
even if they have a idea about what they want , they may not have the concept to convey this to a designer .
this call for some patience on the part of the interviewer in ask the right question and in wait for answer to come , just as listen to the speaker of another language require special patience .
drawing and model can make design alternative more tangible to the prospective occupant .
people can be show various option and ask to choose among they .
the occupant can move around part of a scale model or even take part in a slide simulation study show how a building facade will appear in different exterior color .
the need survey will be more meaningful when the designer have spend some time among the occupant and know how they think and express themselves .
it would be extremely difficult to conduct a need analysis in a specialize building without know the technical vocabulary of the resident .
experience how people use space as a preliminary to design be exemplify in the work of landscape architect lawrence halprin .
before the drawing be put on paper , halprin and he staff go out into setting like those for which a design be to be conceive and spend time there in order to develop a choreography of people-place relationship in which movement pattern arc paramount .
halprin have use these choreograph to design such successful place as san francisco ’s ghiradelli square and the forecourt and lovejoy fountain in portland , oregon .
these work illustrate that a design that take people 's activity and interest into account can be exciting , attractive , and in the case of commercial building , economically successful .
what halprin do not do be create sculptural form in he studio and impose they on a location .
it have be argue that architect should live in the type of building that they be design .
the urban development corporation in new york city have require this of they architect for public housing project for some time .
this be not a formal need analysis , but it be one way of ensure that the architect come into direct contact with future occupant .
live among the occupant work better in some place than in other .
in prepare a architectural plan for a university , architect neal deasy live for a week in a dormitory and take all he meal in the dining hall .
dress in a conservative tweed suit and vest , he feel he be “ as conspicuous as a piebald aardvark ” .
the approach prove more successful in the outdoor area of the campus .
deasy start he observation at 7:30 a.m. and conclude at 10 p.m.
he follow a set course through the campus and note what be take place , who be involve , and what they be do .
photograph be take at key location and be print on inexpensive proof sheet .
have the photograph independently analyze serve as a check on the observer .
the picture be useful in transmit the architect recommendation to he client .
photograph be often more persuasive than word for convey the reality of human behavior , especially when the behavior be at odds with conventional expectation about how a area be be use .
kathryn anthony have be document the cost and benefit of need analysis in several construction project undertake by the architectural office of patrick sullivan associates in san luis obispo , california .
she have be able to show how the need analysis lower project cost .
in the case of two jail , the research show that a lower level of security hardware and construction be feasible , and in the construction of a city hall , how similar type of work station could be consolidate .
on the city hall project , which be scale down 15 percent because of the efficiency of the open-office modular work station recommend by the researcher , the client be bill for under 1,300 consultant hour .
a criticism of need analysis be that it will awaken false hope if people assume that they will always get what they request .
this expectation can be avoid , or at least minimize , by a clear statement in the survey that it may not be possible to fulfill everyone 's wish and by clearly state at the outset the scope , resource , and limitation of the propose project .
on the other hand , it be necessary that people believe that they suggestion will receive a fair hearing .
otherwise they reply be not likely to be very useful for the una .
chapter 3 narrate the anti-conquest
at time indeed the company official allow the main slave depot in cape town to be use as a son of brothel .
( philip curtin et al. , african history ( 1978 ) )
it be a relief to turn from these scene of contention and disorder to notice the effort that be make at this time [ 1793 ] by several colonist to improve the domestic animal of the country .
( george m. theal , a history of southern africa ( 1907 ) )
the previous chapter introduce the eighteenth-century systematizing of nature as a european knowledge-building project that create a new kind of eurocentered planetary consciousness .
blanket the surface of the globe , it specify plant and animal in visual term as discrete entity , subsume and reassemble they in a finite , totalize order of european making .
perhaps one should be more specific about the term : “ european ” in this instance refer above all to a network of literate northern europeans , mainly man from the lower level of the aristocracy and the middle and upper level of the bourgeoisie .
“ nature ” mean above all region and ecosystem which be not dominate by “ europeans , ” while include many region of the geographical entity know as europe .
the project of natural history determine many sort of social and signify practice , of which travel and travel writing be among the most vital .
for the purpose of this book , what be of chief interest be the mutual engagement between natural history and european economic and political expansionism .
as i suggest above , natural history assert a urban , lettered , male authority over the whole of the planet ; it elaborate a rationalize , extractive , dissociative understanding which overlay functional , experiential relation among people , plant , and animal .
in these respects , it figure a certain kind of global hegemony , notably one base on possession of land and resource rather than control over route .
at the same time , in and of itself , the system of nature as a descriptive paradigm be a utterly benign and abstract appropriation of the planet .
claim no transformative potential whatsoever , it differ sharply from overtly imperial articulation of conquest , conversion , territorial appropriation , and enslavement .
the system create , as i suggest above , a utopian , innocent vision of european global authority , which i refer to as a anti-conquest .
the term be intend to emphasize the relational meaning of natural history , the extent to which it become meaningful specifically in contrast with a earlier imperial , and prebourgeoi , european expansionist presence .
this chapter undertake to illustrate more concretely the impact of natural history and global science on travel writing .
through a set of example , i aim to suggest how natural history provide means for narrate inland travel and exploration aim not at the discovery of trade route , but at territorial surveillance , appropriation of resource , and administrative control .
this discussion be intend to be read in conjunction with two subsequent chapter , which take up sentimental travel writing , the other main form of anti-conquest in this period .
in travel literature , i argue , science and sentiment code the imperial frontier in the two eternally clash and complementary language of bourgeois subjectivity .
in what follow i examine a sequence of four north european travel book on southern africa write across the eighteenth century and span what i have be call the linnaean watershed : peter kolb ’s the present state of the cape of good hope ( germany , 1719 ) ; anders sparrman ’s voyage to the cape of good hope ( sweden , 1775 ) ; william paterson ’s narrative of four voyages in the land of the hottentots and the kaffirs ( britain , 1789 ) , and john barrow ’s travels into the interior of southern africa ( britain , 1801 ) .
my aim here be not to survey the extensive literature of travel on southern africa in this period ; rather , i have select four text that particularly illustrate the discursive impact of natural history and the new planetary consciousness .
( a contrasting instance of southern african travel writing be take up in the next chapter . )
my observation coincide at a number of point with those of j.m. coetzee in he 1988 study white write : on the culture of letter in south africa .
the opening chapter of this valuable book focus heavily on eighteenth - and nineteenth-century travel write on south africa , include the writer discuss here .
coetzee go on to examine how european problematic of representation carry forward into nineteenth - and twentieth-century literature in south africa , as i have try to do for spanish america in chapter 7 below .
the literature on the cape of good hope be a particularly fruitful one for study the discursive shift in travel writing , for the cape be one place where scientific travel , the momentum for inland expansion , and the shift relation of contact these engender , play themselves out conspicuously and dramatically .
the “ great age ” of scientific travel be usually associate with the south sea expedition of cook , bougainville , and other , first organize around the transit of venus in 1768 .
these maritime expedition indeed inaugurate the era of scientific travel , and scientific travel writing .
but at the same time , they mark a end : the last great navigational phase of european exploration .
cook discover and map the shore of the last uncharted continent , australia .
in a way , he set the stage for the new phase of inland exploration .
the cape of good hope be one of the few place in africa where northern europeans have access to the continental interior .
it be a magnet both for settler and for explorer eager to make they mark .
it be a place where interior colonization break into open conflict with sea-oriented mercantilism , where competition among european nation be play out as warfare .
in the early decade of the nineteenth century , as inland expansion proceed , southern africa be also to become a canonical test site for the civilizing mission in the labor of the london missionary society and they unmanageable star , david livingstone .
establish in 1652 by the dutch east india company as a supply port for commercial ship , the cape colony prove a vital stopping-off point for european traveler of all kind .
fresh meat be available from the indigenous khoikhoi ( “ hottentot ” ) population , while the company grow fresh vegetable to combat scurvy , provide leisure , care for sick sailor , supply ship with healthy crewmember , and so on .
vulnerable to attack and dependent on the indigenous cattle-herding population for fresh meat , the company initially take pain to minimize its encroachment on the region and its exploitation of indigenous labor .
a proposal to attempt enslave the khoikhoi in 1654 be reject ; slave be procure initially from west africa , then from malay and ceylon .
nevertheless , frontier conflict be immediate and constant ( the first cross-racial murder record be in 1653 ) , and intensify greatly in the 1670s as interior colonization by europeans expand as well .
within a few year of found the cape colony , the dutch east india company reluctantly agree to grant a portion of the inhabitant the status of “ free burgher , ” or independent farmer , and to allow they to wrest grazing and farming land from the cattle-rearing indigenous people .
this population of independent colonist grow slowly , largely out of the rank of company worker , strand sailor , and african or euroafrican woman .
( till 1685 there be no racial prohibition on marriage ; in 1685 marriage be outlaw between europeans and africans , but not between europeans and person of mixed blood . )
the settler ’ number be substantially increase in 1689 by 150 huguenot dissenter from holland , who bring with they the dutch reformed church .
in 1699 the free burgher ( boer ) population , the ancestor of today ’s afrikaners , number just over 1,000 man , woman , and child , own a unspecified number of slave .
a century later , they be 17,000 plus 26,000 slave .
today they number two million .
the outline of today ’s afrikaner agro-pastoral society — and today ’s south african race war — be thus already in place by 1700 .
the prison at robben island , where nelson mandela and the founder of the african national congress be hold during the 1960 , be establish in 1657 for hottentots “ who assault or rob a burgher . ”
largely outside the control of company administration , and often at odds with the company ’s interest , free burgher society develop along its own expansive line , press its way inland , usually in conflict and occasionally in alliance with resident khoikhoi chiefdom .
by force of horse ( which indigenous african be forbid by law to own ) , firearm ( which european settler be require by law to own ) , and strategic alliance among rival group , the europeans gradually overcome indigenous control and break up local socioeconomic structure .
smallpox epidemic in 1713 , 1755 , and 1767 weaken the indigenous position .
gradually more and more khoikhoi be force into the role of subsistence laborer , herd the boers ’ cattle rather than they own .
by 1778 the new governor von plattenburg report find no autonomous khoikhoi community in the cape colony .
which be not , of course , to say that indigenous society and indigenous resistance to colonization end here ; both continue in form which i will discuss further below .
from the beginning of they presence , europeans in the cape periodically mount expedition to explore the interior .
one early object of interest , typical of the seventeenth century , be a mythical , gold-producing empire know as monomatapa , akin to the el dorado so long seek in the americas .
these early expedition be not see as have produce any discovery of value ; nor , in the era of navigational narrative , do they result in travel book .
not till the early eighteenth century do a european literature on southern africa begin in earnest , one of the first major contribution be peter kolb ’s the present state of the cape of good hope .
peter kolb and the revindication of the hottentot
publish in german in 1719 , kolb ’s book be translate into dutch ( 1721 ) , english ( 1731 ) , and french ( 1741 ) , and remain one of the main print source on southern africa through the first half of the century .
train as a mathematician , kolb be send to the cape in 1706 by a prussian patron to carry out astronomical and meteorological research .
though he mission be scientific , kolb ’s account , like that of la condamine in south america , be not .
he book , like la condamine ’s , contrast in a number of respects with writings on the other side of the linnaean watershed .
it be devote mainly , as the title page put it , to “ a particular account of the several nation of the hottentots : they religion , government , laws , customs , ceremonies , and opinion ; they art of war , professions , language , genius , andamp ; c together with a short account of the dutch settlement at the cape . ”
kolb ’s account consist in the main of vivid ethnographic description of khoikhoi society and lifeway in the traditional mode of manners and custom description .
while he account be base on what kolb describe as year of contact with many different group of hottentots , this contact itself be not narrate , nor be kolb ’s travels in the interior .
kolb be write before narrative paradigm for interior travel and exploration emerge in the last decade of the century .
in 1719 navigational paradigm still prevail : the only part of he experience kolb do present as narrative be he six-month sea voyage to arrive at the cape .
in keep with the convention of navigational narrative , the trip be tell as a survival story complete with storm , sickness , brackish water , and threat of attack on the high sea .
as its title promise , kolb ’s account include chapter on khoikhoi form of government , religion , ceremony , domestic economy , cattle management , medicine , and so on .
it be easy to vouch for the vividness of the description , but less easy to speak for its accuracy .
kolb declare he “ make it a rule not to be believe any thing i do not see of which a sight could be have , ” but in the very next sentence confirm have see “ that negro be bear white ” and change color several day later !
nevertheless , he account be undeniably the most substantive source on the indigenous people of the cape in this period .
here be a representative passage , to give something of the flavor of he writing :
chapter 1 cosmic ray
what be cosmic ray ?
cosmic ray particle hit the earth 's atmosphere at the rate of about 1000 per square meter per second .
they be ionize nucleus - about 90 % proton , 9 % alpha particle and the rest heavier nucleus - and they be distinguish by they high energy .
most cosmic ray be relativistic , have energy comparable to or somewhat greater than they mass .
a very few of they have ultrarelativistic energy extend up to 1020 ev ( about 20 joule ) , eleven order of magnitude greater than the equivalent rest mass energy of a proton .
the fundamental question of cosmic ray physics be , " where do they come from ? " and in particular , " how be they accelerate to such high energy ? "
the answer to the question of the origin of cosmic ray be not yet fully know .
it be clear , however , that nearly all of they come from outside the solar system , but from within the galaxy .
the relatively few particle of solar origin be characterize by temporal association with violent event on the sun and consequently by a rapid variability .
in contrast , the bulk of cosmic ray show a anticorrelation with solar activity , be more effectively exclude from the solar neighborhood during period when the expand , magnetize plasma from the sun - the solar wind - be most intense .
the very highest energy cosmic ray have gyroradius in typical galactic magnetic field that be larger than the size of the galaxy .
these may be of extragalactic origin .
1.2 objective of this book
the focus of this book be the interface between particle physics and cosmic ray .
until the advent of accelerator , cosmic ray and they interaction be the main source of information about elementary particle .
although the highest energy cosmic ray can still offer clue about particle physics above accelerator energy , this be no longer the dominant aspect of the field .
there be now , however , a number of important area in which a knowledge of particle interaction be necessary to understand the astrophysical implication of cosmic ray datum .
example include :
production of secondary cosmic ray such as antiproton by primary cosmic ray when they collide with atomic nucleus in the interstellar medium .
from the relative amount of such secondary we learn about how cosmic ray propagate through the interstellar medium and hence about the nature of the matter and field that make up the medium .
production of photon , neutrino and other particle in collision of cosmic ray with material near a site of cosmic ray acceleration .
see point source of such particle be a way of identify specific source of cosmic ray acceleration and study how they work .
penetration of cosmic ray underground and the detection of muon and neutrino in large , deep detector .
such particle can be both signal ( for example , neutrino from the point source just mention ) and background ( for example , for the search for proton decay or magnetic monopole ) .
the relation between atmospheric cascade and the incoming cosmic ray that produce they .
the highest energy cosmic ray be so rare that they can not be directly observe with small detector above the atmosphere , but they must be study indirectly by large air shower array expose for long period at the surface .
then one have to infer the nature of the primary from its secondary cascade .
search for exotic particle and new interaction in the cosmic radiation .
these topic clearly have a great deal in common : the same equation that govern particle cascade in the atmosphere of the earth also describe particle production by cosmic ray accelerate by a collapsed star which then collide in a surround supernova envelope or in the atmosphere of a nearby companion star .
the same cross section that determine the neutrino-induced signal in a underground detector also determine how much energy be absorb by a companion star due to interaction of neutrino produce by cosmic ray accelerate in the system .
the purpose of this book be to discuss the relevant particle physics and illustrate the application to cosmic ray astrophysics with example of current interest .
at the same time i will try to provide a sufficient overview of cosmic ray physics so the importance of these example can be appreciate .
1.3 type of cosmic ray experiment
the principal datum about the cosmic ray themselves , from which one can hope to learn about they origin , be the relative abundance of the different nucleus ( composition ) and the distribution in energy ( energy spectrum ) of each component .
comparison with the chemical composition of various astrophysical object , such as the sun , the interstellar medium , supernova or neutron star , can give clue about the site at which cosmic ray be inject into the acceleration process .
the energy spectrum may be characteristic of certain acceleration mechanism .
figure 1.1 give a global view of the total cosmic ray energy spectrum .
because of the enormous range of flux , it be useful to plot the flux per logarthmic interval of energy ( edn/de = dn/dlne ) .
even so the vertical axis be extremely compress .
a moment ’s thought about the range of rate in fig . 1.1 will convince you that several quite different kind of detector be necessary to study cosmic ray over this whole energy range .
in the interval around one gev , about 10 particle per second cross a telescope consist of two plane of area 100 cm2 separate by 20 cm ( see fig . 1.2 ) .
a small detector fly at the top of the atmosphere in a balloon or spacecraft be therefore sufficient to study detail of cosmic ray composition in the gev energy region down to the level of one part in a hundred thousand .
in contrast , the university of chicago detector on spacelab ( fig . 1.3 ) be one of the largest ever fly , so it be sensitive to cosmic ray of much higher energy .
it be carry on board the challenger spacecraft from july 29 to august 6 , 1985 , during which time it have a effective exposure of 94 hour .
it have a aperture of approximately 2 m2sr .
from fig . 1.1 we can therefore estimate that during this exposure nearly 100 000 particle with energy within a factor of two of 1 tev pass through the detector .
the spectrum be so steep , however , that only about 50 particle above 100 tev would have pass through the detector during the flight , and most of these would likely have have charge below the charge threshold of the detector , which be design for heavy nucleus .
a earlier soviet spacecraft experiment ( grigorov et al. , 1970 ) , as well as the japanese-american balloon experiment ( burnett et al. , 1983 ) also probe similar energy .
for the time be , because of the limited exposure available , 100 tev be about the highest energy at which cosmic ray can be study directly with detector at the top of the atmosphere .
problem : the instrument in fig . 1.2 consist of two circular detector in coincidence , each with 100 cm2 area and separate by 20 cm .
the maximum angle that will trigger the detector depend on the point of intersection of the trajectory with the first detector as well as its direction .
show that the acceptance of this detector be ≈ 22cm2 sr for downward-going particle .
to study cosmic ray with higher energy require detector with larger area expose for longer period of time .
at present the only way to overcome the problem of low flux at high energy be to build a detector on the surface of the earth .
such detector , call air shower array , can have area measure in square kilometer and exposure time limit only by the patience of the experimenter and the generosity of the funding agency .
ground-based detector can not detect the primary cosmic ray directly , but only the remnant of the atmospheric cascade of particle initiate by the incident particle .
they therefore give only limited , indirect information about the nature of the primary .
despite the obvious difficulty of the subject , the ultra-high energy involve continue to stimulate interest in it .
a knowledge of particle physics be essential in order to interpret the cascade and infer something about the primary .
we will return to this subject in the final section of the book .
for the remainder of this chapter we focus on the bulk of the cosmic ray at lower energy .
1.4 composition
the relative abundance of cosmic ray be compare with abundance of element in the solar system in fig . 1.4 .
the symbol in fig . 1.4 have the follow meaning : solid circle : low energy datum , 70 - 280 mev/a ; open circle : high energy datum , 1000 - 2000 mev/a . solar system abundance be show by open diamond .
both solar system and cosmic ray abundance show the odd even effect , with the more tightly bind , even z nucleus be more abundant .
there be , however , two striking difference between the two composition .
first , nucleus with z ' 1 be much more abundant relative to proton in the cosmic ray than they be in solar system material .
this be not really understand , but it could have something to do with the fact that hydrogen be relatively hard to ionize for injection into the acceleration process , or it could reflect a genuine difference in composition at the source .
the second difference be well understand and be a important tool for understand propagation and confinement of cosmic ray in the galaxy .
the two group of element li , be , b and sc , ti , v , cr , mn be many order of magnitude more abundant in the cosmic radiation than in solar system material .
these element be essentially absent as end product of stellar nucleosynthesis .
they be nevertheless present in the cosmic radiation as spallation product of the abundant nucleus of carbon and oxygen ( li , be , b ) and of iron ( sc , ti , v , cr , mn ) .
they be produce by collision of cosmic ray in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .
from a knowledge of the cross section for spallation , one can learn something about the amount of matter traverse by cosmic ray between production and observation .
( note the implication that secondary such as photon , neutrino and antiproton should also be produce at a certain rate as cosmic ray propagate through the ism .
we shall return to this subject in chapter 10 . )
for the bulk of the cosmic ray the mean amount of matter traverse be of order x = 5 to 10 g/cm2 .
the density . . . in the disk of the galaxy be of order one proton per cm3 , so this thickness of material correspond to a distance of . . . .
since the cosmic ray may spend some time in the more diffuse galactic halo , this be a lower limit to the distance travelled .
in any case , l' would ≈ 0.1 kpc , the half-thickness of the disk of the galaxy .
this imply that cosmic ray confinement be a diffusive process in which the particle rattle around for a long time before escape into intergalactic space .
1.5 energy spectrum
the spectrum for several element of the cosmic ray be show in fig . 1.5 .
the proportion of the major component ( with the exception of iron ) be relatively constant with energy ( see table 1.1 ) .
they be well describe by a inverse power law in energy , with differential flux give by . . . .
the spectrum continue up to e ~ 106 gev with . . . ≈ 1.7 ; above this energy the spectrum steepen to . . . ~ 2.0 .
a important point to note , however , be that the boron spectrum be steeper than the spectrum of its parent oxygen and carbon nucleus .
in fact , all secondary nucleus ( i.e. those produce as spallation product of abundant species ) have significantly steeper spectrum than the primary nucleus .
the secondary to primary ratio decrease as energy increase .
this tell we that the higher energy cosmic ray diffuse out of the galaxy faster .
cosmic ray composition relative to proton in the 10 - 100 gev range be show in table 1.1 .
the table show the fraction of nucleus relative to proton in four different way .
flux be normally quote as in column ( 1 ) : particle per gev per nucleon .
academic discipline periodically undergo reorientation as core theme shift to re-direct research and focus attention on new question or reexamine traditional problem from new perspective .
in the humanities and social science , a recent line of inquiry have focus on space , prompt scholar of society and culture to talk about a spatial turn within they discipline .
even a cursory review of literature reveal the influence of this new direction .
subject matter , once organize largely as period and era , increasingly be order under spatial theme , such as region , diaspora , contact zone , and border or boundary , among other .
this shift have be accompany by and reinforce through a equivalent concern with material culture , build and natural environment , and other marker of space and place .
it be not the first time that attention to space and time have reshape the way we approach social and cultural question .
a similar turn occur from 1880 to 1920 when a series of sweeping technological change create new way of think about time and space .
distance-collapsing innovation - the telephone , wireless telegraph , radio , cinema , automobile , and airplane , among other - challenge traditional understanding of how time and space intersect with the social world .
it suddenly be possible to know event as they occur , and this experience of simultaneity refashion people ’s sense of distance and direction .
it also mean that individual be no longer cut off from the flow of time ; widely available film and photographic image make the past as accessible as the present , while new development in science and the world fair that showcase they make the future seem more definite and real .
new scientific theory , business practice , and cultural form reinforce the shift :
einstein ’s theory of relativity and freud ’s conception of psychoanalysis shaped consciousness directly ; time-management study , such as taylorism , dominate manufacturing ; and james joyce and marcel proust explore how to link time and space in novel , while the cubists challenge notion of spatial perspective and form that have long dominate art .
a continuous thread link the first spatial turn with the one we have experience more recently , but it be likely that this second turn will have a more profound influence on the theory and practice of history and the humanities .
the early twentieth-century conception of space and time have less effect on the study of the past than it do on art and literature .
frederick jackson turner ’s frontier thesis and its emphasis on the development of the american west and the history it spawn be exception , as be the decade-long work of the annales movement ; both school reflect a intentional focus on question of space and time .
but the cataclysm of the mid-twentieth century , from world war and revolution to mass movement for equality , ultimately spur historian to search for the root of momentous event in idea and politics and technological or social change , cause for which spatial marker be less pronounced .
the consideration for space do not disappear , but they become mark by particularity , a emphasis on place , as scholar begin to discern how the story of change differ from one location to another .
the focus on place reflect and reinforce a postmodernist unease with the grand narrative , which create a literature that increasingly become fragmented , with analysis exist at different geographical and temporal scale and few effort make to link they .
for many humanist , space itself become less geographical and more metaphorical , as scholar find richer meaning in conceptual space - for instance , gendered space , racialized space , or the body as space - than in category relate to the physical environment , the traditional frame of definition for spatial term .
today , historian and other humanist be acutely aware of the social and political construction of space and its particular expression as place .
space be not simply the setting for historical action but be a significant product and determinant of change .
they be not passive setting but the medium for the development of culture : “ space be not a empty dimension along which social grouping become structured , ” sociologist anthony giddens note , “ but have to be consider in term of its involvement in the constitution of system of interaction ” ( giddens 1984 , 364 ) .
all space contain embedded story base on what have happen there .
these story be both individual and collective , and each of they link geography ( space ) and history ( time ) .
more important , they all reflect the value and cultural code present in the various political and social arrangement that provide structure to society .
in this sense , then , the meaning of space , especially as place or landscape , be always be construct through the various contest that occur over power .
there be nothing new in this development - the earliest map reveal the power arrangement of past society - but humanities scholarship increasingly reflect what may in fact , by the greatest legacy of postmodernism , the acknowledgment that we understanding of the world itself be socially construct .
at its core , the spatial turn reject the universal truth , grand narrative , and structural explanation that dominate the social science and the humanities during much of last century .
above all , it be about the particular and the local , without any supposition that one form of culture be better than another .
its claim be straightforward : to understand human society and culture , we must understand how it develop in certain circumstance and in certain time and at certain place .
from this knowledge , we can appreciate that the world be not flat but incredibly complicated and diverse .
this view no longer seem new because humanist have embrace it eagerly ; now we all recognize the particularity of space , the importance of place .
but for all the use we make of this insight — and for all its explanatory power — the concept of space and place employ by historian frequently be metaphorical and not geographical .
far less often have we grapple with how the physical world have shape we or how in turn we have shape perception of we material environment .
new spatial technology , especially geographic information system ( gi ) , be now facilitate a ( re ) discovery of geographical space in history and the other humanities .
at its core , gi be a powerful software that use location to integrate and visualize information .
within a gis , user can discover relationship that make a complex world more immediately understandable by visually detect spatial pattern that remain hide in text and table .
map have serve this function for a long time , but gis bring impressive computing power to this task .
its core strength be its ability to integrate , analyze , and make visual a vast array of datum from different format , all by virtue of they share geography .
this capability have attract considerable interest from historian , archaeologist , linguist , student of material culture , and other who be interested in place , dense coil of memory , artifact , and experience that exist in a particular space , as well as in the coincidence and movement of people , goods , and idea that have occur across time in space large and small .
recent year have witness a wide-ranging , if still limit , application of gi to historical and cultural question : do the dust bowl of the 1920s and 1930s result from over-farm the land or be it primarily the consequence of larger term environmental change ?
what influence do the rapidly change cityscape of london have on literature in elizabethan england ?
what be the relationship between ruler and territory in the checkered political landscape of state formation in the nineteenth-century germany ?
how do spatial network influence the administrative geography of medieval china ?
what spatial influence shape the development of the transcontinental railroad in the united states ?
increasingly , scholar have turn to gi to provide new perspective on these and other topic that previously have be study outside of a explicitly spatial framework .
despite this flurry of interest and activity , most use to date of gi in historical and cultural study have be disparate , application drive , and often tie to the somewhat its more obvious role in census boundary delineation and map making .
while not seek to minimize the importance of such work , these study have rarely address the broader , more fundamental issue that surround the introduction of a spatial technology such as gi into the humanities .
there be core reason why gis have find early use and ready acceptance in the science and social science rather than in the more qualitatively base humanities .
the humanities pose far greater epistemological and ontological issue that challenge the technology in a number of way , from the imprecision and uncertainty of datum to concept of relative space , the use of time as a organize principle , and the mutually constitutive relationship between time and space .
essentially , gi and its related technology currently allow user to determine a geometry of space .
in the context of the humanities , it will be necessary to move gi from this more limited quantitative representation of space to facilitate a understanding of place within time and the role that place occupy in humanities discipline .
in they essence , historian seek to generalize from the particular , not for the purpose of find universal law but rather to glean insight about cause and effect from a known outcome .
here , the humanities differ from much of social science , which attempt to reach a generalization that hold true in any similar circumstance .
this difference be significant and influence the way the two group of scholar create knowledge .
for many social scientist , the search for trustworthy generalization focus on the isolation of a independent variable , the cause that have a predictable effect on dependent variable or one that respond to the stimulus or presence of a catalyst .
they believe it be possible to discover such a variable , give sufficient resource , because the world be not yet lose to they .
historian must contend with fragmentary evidence and be painfully aware that the past be incomplete and irretrievable .
they also be skeptical of prediction .
the past can not be change , even if its interpretation as history be continually in flux , but in it the intersection of pattern and singular event can be discover .
not so the future , where continuity and contingency coexist independently of one another .
historian view reality as weblike , to use philosopher michael oakeshott ’s phrase , because they see everything as related in some way to everything else .
interdependency be the lingua franca of the humanities , and most recently , it have become embody in practice theory , or in the view of one of its lead proponent , historian william sewell , “ social life may be conceptualize as be compose of countless happening or encounter in which person or group of person engage in social action . ”
in this view , society and social system be “ continually shaped and reshape by the creativity and stubbornness of they human creator ” ( sewell 2005 , 110 – 111 ) .
another historian , ed ayers , have label this concept “ deep contingency , ” a effort to understand society as a whole with “ all structure put into motion and motion put into structure ” ( ayers 2010 , 7 ) .
the goal of historical scholarship be not to model or replicate the past ; a model imply the work out of dependent and independent variable for purpose of prediction , whereas replication suggest the ability to know the past and its cultural form more completely than most humanist would acknowledge be possible .
humanist practice a extractive scholarship : they have the capacity for selectivity and shift perspective in the pursuit of the fullest possible understanding of heritage and culture .
traditionally , humanities scholar have use narrative to construct the portrait that further this objective .
narrative encourage the interweaving of evidentiary thread and permit the scholar to qualify , highlight , or subdue any thread or set of they — to use emphasis , nuance , and other literary device to achieve the complex construction of past world .
all of these element - interdependency , narrative , and nuance , among other - predispose the humanist to look askance at any method or tool that appear to reduce complex event to simple scheme .
chapter 1 decision theory and human behavior
people be not logical .
they be psychological .
anonymous
people often make mistake in they math .
this do not mean that we should abandon arithmetic .
jack hirshleifer
decision theory be the analysis of the behavior of a individual face nonstrategic uncertainty — that be , uncertainty that be due to what we term " nature ” ( a stochastic natural event such as a coin flip , seasonal crop loss , personal illness , and the like ) or , if other individual be involve , they behavior be treat as a statistical distribution know to the decision maker .
decision theory depend on probability theory , which be develop in the seventeenth and eighteenth century by such notable as blaise pascal , daniel bernoulli , and thomas bayes .
a rational actor be a individual with consistent preference ( § 1.1 ) .
a rational actor need not be selfish .
indeed , if rationality imply selfishness , the only rational individual would be sociopath .
belief , call subjective prior in decision theory , logically stand between choice and payoff .
belief be primitive datum for the rational actor model .
in fact , belief be the product of social process and be share among individual .
to stress the importance of belief in modeling choice , i often describe the rational actor model as the belief , preference and constraint model , or the bpc model .
the bpc terminology have the add attraction of avoid the confusing and value-laden term " rational . ”
the bpc model require only preference consistency , which can be defend on basic evolutionary grounds .
while there be eminent critic of preference consistency , they claim be valid in only a few narrow area .
because preference consistency do not presuppose unlimited information-processing capacity and perfect knowledge , even bound rationality ( simon 1982 ) be consistent with the bpc model .
because one can not do behavioral game theory , by which i mean the application of game theory to the experimental study of human behavior , without assume preference consistency , we must accept this axiom to avoid the analytical weakness of the behavioral discipline that reject the bpc model , include psychology , anthropology , and sociology ( see chapter 12 ) .
behavioral decision theorist have argue that there be important area in which individual appear to have inconsistent preference .
except when individual do not know they own preference , this be a conceptual error base on a misspecification of the decision maker 's preference function .
we show in this chapter that , assume individual know they preference , add information concern the current state of the individual to the choice space eliminate preference inconsistency .
moreover , this addition be completely reasonable because preference function do not make any sense unless we include information about the decision maker 's current state .
when we be hungry , scared , sleepy , or sexually deprive , we preference order adjust accordingly .
the idea that we should have a utility function that do not depend on we current wealth , the current time , or we current strategic circumstance be also not plausible .
traditional decision theory ignore the individual 's current state , but this be just a oversight that behavioral decision theory have bring to we attention .
compelling experiment in behavioral decision theory show that human violate the principle of expect utility in systematic way ( § 1.7 ) .
again , be must be stress that this do not imply that human violate preference consistency over the appropriate choice space but rather that they have incorrect belief derive from what might be term " folk probability theory ” and make systematic performance error in important case ( levy 2008 ) .
to understand why this be so , we begin by note that , with the exception of hyperbolic discounting when time be involve ( § 1.4 ) , there be no report failure of the expect utility theorem in nonhuman , and there be some extremely beautiful example of its satisfaction ( real 1991 ) .
moreover , territoriality in many species be a indication of loss aversion ( chapter 11 ) .
the difference between human and other animal be that the latter be test in real life , or in elaborate simulation of real life , as in leslie real 's work with bumblebee ( 1991 ) , where subject bumblebee be release into elaborate spatial model of flowerbed .
human , by contrast , be test use imperfect analytical model of real-life lottery .
while it be important to know how human choose in such situation , there be certainly no guarantee they will make the same choice in the real-life situation and in the situation analytically generate to represent it .
evolutionary game theory be base on the observation that individual be more likely to adopt behavior that appear to be successful for other .
a heuristic that say " adopt risk profile that appear to have be successful to other ” may lead to preference consistency even when individual be incapable of evaluate analytically present lottery in the laboratory .
in addition to the explanatory success of theory base on the bpc model , support evidence from contemporary neuroscience suggest that expect utility maximization be not simply a " as if ” story .
in fact , the brain 's neural circuitry actually make choice by internally represent the payoff of various alternative as neural firing rate and choose a maximal such rate ( shizgal 1999 ; glimcher 2003 ; glimcher and rusti-chini 2004 ; glimcher , dorris , and bayer 2005 ) .
neuroscientist increasingly find that a aggregate decision make process in the brain synthesize all available information into a single unitary value ( parker and newsome 1998 ; schall and thompson 1999 ) .
indeed , when animal be test in a repeat trial set with variable reward , dopamine neuron appear to encode the difference between the reward that the animal expect to receive and the reward that the animal actually receive on a particular trial ( schultz , dayan , and montague 1997 ; sutton and barto 2000 ) , a evaluation mechanism that enhance the environmental sensitivity of the animal 's decision make system .
this error prediction mechanism have the drawback of seek only local optimum ( sugrue , corrado , and newsome 2005 ) .
montague and berns ( 2002 ) address this problem , show that the orbitofrontal cortex and striatum contain a mechanism for more global prediction that include risk assessment and discounting of future reward .
they datum suggest a decision-making model that be analogous to the famous black-scholes options-pricing equation ( black and scholes 1973 ) .
the existence of a integrate decision-making apparatus in the human brain itself be predict by evolutionary theory .
the fitness of a organism depend on how effectively it make choice in a uncertain and vary environment .
effective choice must be a function of the organism 's state of knowledge , which consist of the information supply by the sensory input that monitor the organism 's internal state and its external environment .
in relatively simple organism , the choice environment be primitive and be distribute in a decentralized manner over sensory input .
but in three separate group of animal , craniate ( vertebrate and related creature ) , arthropod ( include insect , spider , and crustacean ) , and cephalopod ( squid , octopus , and other mollusk ) , a central nervous system with a brain ( a centrally located decision-making and control apparatus ) evolve .
the phylogenetic tree of vertebrate exhibit increase complexity through time and increase metabolic and morphological cost of maintain brain activity .
thus , the brain evolve because larger and more complex brain , despite they cost , enhance the fitness of they carrier .
brain therefore be ineluctably structure to make consistent choice in the face of the various constellation of sensory input they bearer commonly experience .
before the contribution of bernoulli , savage , von neumann , and other expert , no creature on earth know how to value a lottery .
the fact that people do not know how to evaluate abstract lottery do not mean that they lack consistent preference over the lottery that they face in they daily life .
despite these proviso , experimental evidence on choice under uncertainty be still of great importance because in the modern world we be increasingly call upon to make such " unnatural ” choice base on scientific evidence concern payoff and they probability .
1.1 belief , preferences , and constraint
in this section we develop a set of behavioral property , among which consistency be the most prominent , that together ensure that we can model agent as maximizer of preference .
a binary relation . . . a on a set a be a subset of a x a.
we usually write the proposition ( x , y ) . . . a as x . . . a y.
for instance , the arithmetical operator " less than ” ( ' ) be a binary relation , where ( x , y ) . . . ' be normally write x ' y.
a preference order ≥ a on a be a binary relation with the follow three property , which must hold for all x , y , z . . . a and any set b :
complete : x ≥ a y or y ≥ a x ;
transitive : x ≥ a y and y ≥ a z imply x ≥ a z ;
independent of irrelevant alternative : for x , y . . . b , x ≥ by if and only if x ≥ a y.
because of the third property , we need not specify the choice set and can simply write x ≥ y.
we also make the behavioral assumption that give any choice set a , the individual choose a element x . . . a such that for all y . . . a , x ≥ y.
when x ≥ y , we say " x be weakly prefer to y . ”
the first condition be completeness , which imply that any member of a be weakly prefer to itself ( for any x in a , x ≥ x ) .
in general , we say a binary relation . . . be reflexive if , for all x , x. . . x.
thus , completeness imply reflexivity .
we refer to ≥ as " weak preference ” in contrast with " strong preference ” ' .
we define x ' y to mean " it be false that y ≥ x. ”
we say x and y be equivalent if x ≥ y and y ≥ x , and we write x . . . y.
as a exercise , you may use elementary logic to prove that if ≥ satisfy the completeness condition , then andamp ; gt ; satisfy the following exclusion condition : if x andamp ; gt ; y , then it be false that y ' x.
the second condition be transitivity , which say that x ≥ y and y ≥ z imply x ≥ z.
it be hard to see how this condition could fail for anything we might like to call a preference order .
as a exercise , you may show that x ' y and y ≥ z imply x ' z , and x ≥ y and y ' z imply x ' z.
similarly , you may use elementary logic to prove that if ≥ satisfy the completeness condition , then . . . be transitive ( i.e. , satisfy the transitivity condition ) .
the third condition , independence of irrelevant alternative ( iium ) mean that the relative attractiveness of two choice do not depend upon the other choice available to the individual .
for instance , suppose a individual generally prefer meat to fish when eat out , but if the restaurant serve lobster , the individual believe the restaurant serve superior fish , and hence prefer fish to meat , even though he never choose lobster ; thus , iium fail .
when iium fail , it can be restore by suitably refine the choice set .
for instance , we can specify two quality of fish instead of one , in the precede example .
more generally , if the desirability of a outcome x depend on the set a from which it be choose , we can form a new choice space . . . * , element of which be order pair ( a , x ) , where x . . . a. . . * , and restrict choice set in . . . * to be subset of . . . * all of whose first element be equal .
in this new choice space , iium be trivially satisfied .
when the preference relation ≥ be complete , transitive , and independent of irrelevant alternative , we term it consistent .
if ≥ be a consistent preference relation , then there will always exist a preference function such that the individual behave as if maximize this preference function over the set a from which he or she be constrain to choose .
formally , we say that a preference function u w a → r represent a binary relation ≥ if , for all x , y . . . a , u ( x ) ≥ u ( y ) if and only if x ≥ y.
we have the follow theorem .
imagine a powerful sovereign who issue command to he subject .
they be under a duty to comply with he wish .
the notion of law as a command lie at the heart of classical legal positivism as espouse by its two great protagonist , jeremy bentham and john austin .
modern legal positivist adopt a considerably more sophisticated approach to the concept of law , but , like they distinguish predecessor , they deny the relationship propose by natural law , outline in the previous chapter , between law and moral .
the claim of natural lawyer that law consist of a series of proposition derive from nature through a process of reasoning be strongly contest by legal positivist .
this chapter describe the essential element of this important legal theory .
the term ‘ positivism ’ derive from the latin positum , which refer to the law as it be lay down or posit .
broadly speak , the core of legal positivism be the view that the validity of any law can be trace to a objectively verifiable source .
put simply , legal positivism , like scientific positivism , reject the view – hold by natural lawyer – that law exist independently from human enactment .
as will become clear in this chapter , the early legal positivism of bentham and austin find the origin of law in the command of a sovereign .
h. l. a. hart look to a rule of recognition that distinguish law from other social rule .
hans kelsen identify a basic norm that validate the constitution .
legal positivist also often claim that there be no necessary connection between law and moral , and that the analysis of legal concept be worth pursue , and distinct from ( though not hostile to ) sociological and historical enquiry and critical evaluation .
the highest common factor among legal positivist be that the law as lay down should be keep separate – for the purpose of study and analysis – from the law as it ought morally to be .
in other word , that a clear distinction must be draw between ‘ ought ’ ( that which be morally desirable ) and ‘ be ’ ( that which actually exist ) .
but it do not follow from this that a legal positivist be indifferent to moral question .
most legal positivist criticize the law and propose mean to reform it .
this normally involve moral judgement .
but positivist do share the view that the most effective method of analyse and understand law involve suspend moral judgement until it be establish what it be we be seek to elucidate .
nor do positivist necessarily subscribe to the proposition , often ascribe to they , that unjust or iniquitous law must be obey – merely because they be law .
indeed , both austin and bentham acknowledge that disobedience to evil law be legitimate if it would promote change for the good .
in the word of the foremost modern legal positivist h. l. a. hart :
[ t ] he certification of something as legally valid be not conclusive of the question of obedience , ...
[ h ] owever great the aura of majesty or authority which the official system may have , its demand must in the end be submit to a moral scrutiny
for hart , as well as bentham , this be one of the major virtue of legal positivism .
law as command : bentham and austin
the prodigious writings of jeremy bentham ( 1748 – 1832 ) constitute a major contribution to positivist jurisprudence and the systematic analysis of law and the legal system .
not only do he seek to expose the shibboleth of he age and construct a comprehensive theory of law , logic , politics , and psychology , found on the principle of utility , but he essay for reform of the law on almost every subject .
he critique of the common law and its theoretical underpinning be especially ferocious .
move by the spirit of the enlightenment , bentham seek to subject the common law to the cold light of reason .
he attempt to demystify the law , to expose , in he characteristically cut style , what lay behind its mask .
appeals to natural law be nothing more than ‘ private opinion in disguise ’ or ‘ the mere opinion of man self-constitute into legislature ’ .
the indeterminacy of the common law , he argue , be endemic .
unwritten law be intrinsically vague and uncertain .
it can not provide a reliable , public standard which can reasonably be expect to guide behaviour .
the chaos of the common law have to be deal with systematically .
for bentham this lay , quite simply , in codification .
legal code would significantly diminish the power of judge ; they task would consist less of interpret than administer the law .
it would also remove much of the need for lawyer : the code would be readily comprehensible without the help of legal adviser .
unlike the continental system of law that have long adopt napoleonic code base on roman law , codification in the common law world remain a dream .
john austin ( 1790 – 1859 ) publish he major work , the province of jurisprudence determine , in 1832 , the year of bentham ’s death .
as a disciple of bentham ’s , austin ’s conception of law be base on the idea of command or imperative , though he provide a less elaborate account of what they be .
both jurist stress the subjection of person by the sovereign to he power , but austin ’s definition be sometimes think to extend not very much further than the criminal law , with its emphasis on control over behaviour .
he identification of command as the hallmark of law lead he to a more restrictive definition of law than be adopt by bentham who seek to formulate a single , complete law which sufficiently express the legislative will .
but both share a concern to confine the scope of jurisprudential enquiry to accounting for and explain the principal feature of the law .
in the case of austin , however , he map of ‘ law properly so call ’ be considerably narrower than bentham ’s , and embrace two category : the law of god and human law .
human law ( i.e. law set down by man for man ) be further divide into positive law or law ‘ strictly so call ’ ( i.e. law lay down by man as political superior or in pursuance of legal rights ) and law lay down by man not as political superior or not in pursuance of legal rights .
law ‘ improperly so call ’ be divide into law by analogy ( e.g. law of fashion , constitutional , and international law ) and by metaphor ( e.g. the law of gravity ) .
law by analogy , together with law set by man not as political superior or in pursuance of legal right , be merely ‘ positive morality ’ .
it be only positive law that be the proper subject of jurisprudence .
bentham be best know as a utilitarian ( see chapter 4 ) and law reformer .
but he insist on the separation between what he call ‘ expositorial ’ and ‘ censorial ’ jurisprudence .
the former describe what be , the latter what ought to be .
austin be no less categorical in preserve this division , but he analysis be narrower in both its compass and purpose than bentham ’s .
though both adhere to a utilitarian morality , and adopt broadly similar view on the nature and function of jurisprudence and the serious inadequacy of the common law tradition , there be several important difference in they general approach to the subject .
in particular , bentham pursue the notion of a single , complete law which adequately express the will of the legislature .
he seek to show how a single law create a single offence define by its be the narrowest species of that kind of offence recognize by the law .
austin , on the other hand , build he scheme of a legal system on the classification of rights ; he be not trouble by a search for a ‘ complete ’ law .
also , in he pursuit to provide a plan of a comprehensive body of law and the element of the ‘ art of legislation ’ , bentham expound a complex ‘ logic of the will ’ .
austin seek to construct a science of law rather than engage himself in bentham ’s art of legislation .
and while bentham seek to devise means by which arbitrary power , especially of judge , might be check , austin be less anxious about these matter .
the central feature of austin ’s map of the province of jurisprudence be the notion of law as a command of the sovereign .
anything that be not a command be not law .
only general command count as law .
and only command emanate from the sovereign be ‘ positive law ’ .
austin ’s insistence on law as command require he to exclude customary , constitutional , and public international law from the field of jurisprudence .
this be because no specific sovereign can be identify as the author of they rule .
thus , in the case of public international law , sovereign state be notoriously at liberty to disregard its requirement .
for bentham , however , command be merely one of four method by which the sovereign enact law .
he distinguish between law which command or prohibit certain conduct ( imperative law ) and those which permit certain conduct ( permissive law ) .
he argue that all law be both penal and civil ; even in the case of title to property there be a penal element .
bentham seek to show that law which impose no obligation or sanction ( what he call ‘ civil law ’ ) be not ‘ complete law ’ , but merely part of law .
and , since he principal objective be the creation of a code of law , he argue that the penal and civil branch should be formulate separately .
the relationship between command and sanction be no less important for austin .
indeed , he very concept of a command include the probability that a sanction will follow failure to obey the command .
but what be a sanction ?
austin define it as some harm , pain , or evil that be conditional upon the failure of a person to comply with the wish of the sovereign .
there must be a realistic probability that it will be inflict upon anyone who infringe a command .
there need only be the threat of the possibility of a minimal harm , pain , or evil , but unless a sanction be likely to follow , the mere expression of a wish be not a command .
obligation be therefore define in term of sanction : this be a central tenet of austin ’s imperative theory .
the likelihood of a sanction be always uncertain , but austin be drive to the rather unsatisfactory position that a sanction consist of ‘ the smallest chance of incur the smallest evil ’ .
the idea of a sovereign issue command pervade the theory of both bentham and austin .
it be important to note that both regard the sovereign ’s power as constitute by the habit of the people generally obey he law .
but while austin insist on the illimitability and indivisibility of the sovereign , bentham , alive to the institution of federalism , acknowledge that the supreme legislative power may be both limited and divide by what he call a express convention .
for austin , to the four feature of a command ( wish , sanction , expression of a wish , and generality ) be to be add a fifth , namely a identifiable political superior – or sovereign – whose command be obey by political inferior and who owe obedience to no one .
this insistence on a omnipotent lawgiver distort those legal system which impose constitutional restriction on the legislative competence of the legislature or which divide such power between a central federal legislature and lawmaking body of constituent state or province ( such as in the united states , canada or australia ) .
bentham , on the other hand , acknowledge that sovereignty may be limit or divide , and accept ( albeit reluctantly ) the possibility of judicial review of legislative action .
austin ’s contention that ‘ law properly so call ’ be confine to the command of a sovereign lead he to base he idea of sovereignty on the habit of obedience adopt by member of society .
the sovereign must , moreover , be determinate ( i.e. the composition of the sovereign body must be unambiguous ) , for ‘ no indeterminate sovereign can command expressly or tacitly , or can receive obedience or submission ’ .
and this result in austin famously refuse to accept as ‘ law ’ public international law , customary law , and a good deal of constitutional law .
moreover , by insist that the sanction be a indispensable ingredient in the definition of law , austin be drive to define duty in term of sanction : if the sovereign express a wish and have the power to inflict a evil ( or sanction ) then a person be under a duty to act in accordance with that wish .
chapter 10 graph
graph be discrete structure consist of vertex and edge that connect these vertex .
there be different kind of graph , depend on whether edge have direction , whether multiple edge can connect the same pair of vertex , and whether loop be allow .
problem in almost every conceivable discipline can be solve use graph model .
we will give example to illustrate how graph be use as model in a variety of area .
for instance , we will show how graph be use to represent the competition of different species in a ecological niche , how graph be use to represent who influence whom in a organization , and how graph be use to represent the outcome of round-robin tournament .
we will describe how graph can be use to model acquaintanceship between people , collaboration between researcher , telephone call between telephone number , and link between website .
we will show how graph can be use to model roadmap and the assignment of job to employee of a organization .
use graph model , we can determine whether it be possible to walk down all the street in a city without go down a street twice , and we can find the number of color need to color the region of a map .
graph can be use to determine whether a circuit can be implement on a planar circuit board .
we can distinguish between two chemical compound with the same molecular formulum but different structure use graph .
we can determine whether two computer be connect by a communication link use graph model of computer network .
graph with weight assign to they edge can be use to solve problem such as find the shortest path between two city in a transportation network .
we can also use graph to schedule exam and assign channel to television station .
this chapter will introduce the basic concept of graph theory and present many different graph model .
to solve the wide variety of problem that can be study use graph , we will introduce many different graph algorithm .
we will also study the complexity of these algorithm .
10.1 graph and graph model
we begin with the definition of a graph .
definition 1 a graph g = ( v , e ) consist of v , a nonempty set of vertex ( or node ) and e , a set of edge .
each edge have either one or two vertex associate with it , call its endpoint .
a edge be say to connect its endpoint .
remark : the set of vertex v of a graph g may be infinite .
a graph with a infinite vertex set or a infinite number of edge be call a infinite graph , and in comparison , a graph with a finite vertex set and a finite edge set be call a finite graph .
in this book we will usually consider only finite graph .
now suppose that a network be make up of datum center and communication link between computer .
we can represent the location of each datum center by a point and each communication link by a line segment , as show in figure 1 .
this computer network can be model use a graph in which the vertex of the graph represent the datum center and the edge represent communication link .
in general , we visualize graph by use point to represent vertex and line segment , possibly curve , to represent edge , where the endpoint of a line segment represent a edge be the point represent the endpoint of the edge .
when we draw a graph , we generally try to draw edge so that they do not cross .
however , this be not necessary because any depiction use point to represent vertex and any form of connection between vertex can be use .
indeed , there be some graph that can not be draw in the plane without edge cross ( see section 10.7 ) .
the key point be that the way we draw a graph be arbitrary , as long as the correct connection between vertex be depict .
note that each edge of the graph represent this computer network connect two different vertex .
that be , no edge connect a vertex to itself .
furthermore , no two different edge connect the same pair of vertex .
a graph in which each edge connect two different vertex and where no two edge connect the same pair of vertex be call a simple graph .
note that in a simple graph , each edge be associate to a unordered pair of vertex , and no other edge be associate to this same edge .
consequently , when there be a edge of a simple graph associate to { u , v } , we can also say , without possible confusion , that { u , v } be a edge of the graph .
a computer network may contain multiple link between datum center , as show in figure 2 .
to model such network we need graph that have more than one edge connect the same pair of vertex .
graph that may have multiple edge connect the same vertex be call multigraph .
when there be m different edge associate to the same unordered pair of vertex { u , v } , we also say that { u , v } be a edge of multiplicity m.
that be , we can think of this set of edge as m different copy of a edge { u , v } .
sometimes a communication link connect a datum center with itself , perhaps a feedback loop for diagnostic purpose .
such a network be illustrate in figure 3 .
to model this network we need to include edge that connect a vertex to itself .
such edge be call loop , and sometimes we may even have more than one loop at a vertex .
graph that may include loop , and possibly multiple edge connect the same pair of vertex or a vertex to itself , be sometimes call pseudograph .
so far the graph we have introduce be undirected graph .
they edge be also say to be undirected .
however , to construct a graph model , we may find it necessary to assign direction to the edge of a graph .
for example , in a computer network , some link may operate in only one direction ( such link be call single duplex line ) .
this may be the case if there be a large amount of traffic send to some datum center , with little or no traffic go in the opposite direction .
such a network be show in figure 4 .
to model such a computer network we use a direct graph .
each edge of a direct graph be associate to a order pair .
the definition of direct graph we give here be more general than the one we use in chapter 9 , where we use direct graph to represent relation .
definition 2 a direct graph ( or digraph ) ( v , e ) consist of a nonempty set of vertex v and a set of direct edge ( or arc ) e.
each direct edge be associate with a order pair of vertex .
the direct edge associate with the order pair ( u , v ) be say to start at u and end at v.
when we depict a direct graph with a line drawing , we use a arrow point from u to v to indicate the direction of a edge that start at u and end at v. a direct graph may contain loop and it may contain multiple direct edge that start and end at the same vertex .
a direct graph may also contain direct edge that connect vertex u and v in both direction ; that be , when a digraph contain a edge from u to v , it may also contain one or more edge from v to u.
note that we obtain a direct graph when we assign a direction to each edge in a undirected graph .
when a direct graph have no loop and have no multiple direct edge , it be call a simple direct graph .
because a simple direct graph have at most one edge associate to each order pair of vertex ( u , v ) , we call ( u , v ) a edge if there be a edge associate to it in the graph .
in some computer network , multiple communication link between two datum center may be present , as illustrate in figure 5 .
directed graph that may have multiple direct edge from a vertex to a second ( possibly the same ) vertex be use to model such network .
we call such graph direct multigraph .
when there be m direct edge , each associate to a order pair of vertex ( u , v ) , we say that ( u , v ) be a edge of multiplicity m.
for some model we may need a graph where some edge be undirected , while other be direct .
a graph with both direct and undirected edge be call a mixed graph .
for example , a mixed graph might be use to model a computer network contain link that operate in both direction and other link that operate only in one direction .
this terminology for the various type of graph be summarize in table 1 .
we will sometimes use the term graph as a general term to describe graph with direct or undirected edge ( or both ) , with or without loop , and with or without multiple edge .
at other time , when the context be clear , we will use the term graph to refer only to undirected graph .
because of the relatively modern interest in graph theory , and because it have application to a wide variety of discipline , many different terminology of graph theory have be introduce .
the reader should determine how such term be be use whenever they be encounter .
the terminology use by mathematician to describe graph have be increasingly standardized , but the terminology use to discuss graph when they be use in other discipline be still quite vary .
although the terminology use to describe graph may vary , three key question can help we understand the structure of a graph :
be the edge of the graph undirected or directed ( or both ) ?
if the graph be undirected , be multiple edge present that connect the same pair of vertex ?
if the graph be direct , be multiple direct edge present ?
be loop present ?
answer such question help we understand graph .
it be less important to remember the particular terminology use .
10.1.1 graph model
graph be use in a wide variety of model .
we begin this section by describe how to construct graph model of communication network link datum center .
we will complete this section by describe some diverse graph model for some interesting application .
we will return to many of these application later in this chapter and in chapter 11 .
we will introduce additional graph model in subsequent section of this and later chapter .
also , recall that direct graph model for some application be introduce in chapter 9 .
when we build a graph model , we need to make sure that we have correctly answer the three key question we pose about the structure of a graph .
social network graph be extensively use to model social structure base on different kind of relationship between people or group of people .
these social structure , and the graph that represent they , be know as social network .
in these graph model , individual or organization be represent by vertex ; relationship between individual or organization be represent by edge .
the study of social network be a extremely active multidisciplinary area , and many different type of relationship between people have be study use they .
we will introduce some of the most commonly study social network here .
example 1 acquaintanceship and friendship graph we can use a simple graph to represent whether two people know each other , that be , whether they be acquaint , or whether they be friend ( either in the real world in the virtual world via a social networking site such as facebook ) .
each person in a particular group of people be represent by a vertex .
a undirected edge be use to connect two people when these people know each other , when we be concern only with acquaintanceship , or whether they be friend .
no multiple edge and usually no loop be use .
( if we want to include the notion of self-knowledge , we would include loop . )
a small acquaintanceship graph be show in figure 6 .
the acquaintanceship graph of all people in the world have more than six billion vertex and probably more than one trillion edge !
we will discuss this graph further in section 10.4 .
chapter 1 definition and nomenclature
this chapter present some basic radar definition and establish much of the nomenclature use throughout this text .
the word radar be a abbreviation for radio detection and range .
in most case , radar system use modulate waveform and directive antenna to transmit electromagnetic energy into a specific volume in space to search for target .
object ( target ) within a search volume will reflect portion of the incident energy ( radar return or echo ) in the direction of the radar .
these echo be then process by the radar receiver to extract target information such as range , velocity , angular position , and other target identify characteristic .
1.1 . radar systems classifications and bands
radar can be classify as ground-based , airborne , spaceborne , or ship-based radar system .
they can also be classify into numerous category base on the specific radar characteristic , such as the frequency band , antenna type , and waveform utilize .
radar system use continuous waveform , modulate or otherwise , be classify as continuous wave ( cw ) radar .
alternatively , radar system use time-limited pulsed waveform be classify as pulsed radar .
another radar system classification be concern with the mission and/or the functionality of the specific radar .
this include : weather , acquisition and search , tracking , track-while-scan , fire control , early warning , over-the-horizon , terrain following , and terrain avoidance radar .
phase array radar utilize phased array antenna , and be often call multifunction ( multimode ) radar .
a phased array be a composite antenna form from two or more basic radiator .
array antenna synthesize narrow directive beam that may be steer , mechanically or electronically .
electronic steering be achieve by control the phase of the electric current feed the array element , and thus the name phase array be adopt .
historically , radar be first develop as military tool .
it be for this primary reason the most common radar system classification be the letter or band designation originally use by the military during and after world war ii .
this letter or band designation have also be adopt as a ieee ( institute of electrical and electronics engineers ) standard .
in recent year , nato ( north atlantic treaty organization ) have adopt a new band designation with easier abecedarian letter .
figure 1.1 show the spectrum associate with these two letter or band radar classification , while table 1.1 present the same information in a structured format .
figure 1.1 . radar system band or letter classification .
table 1.1 . radar system band or letter classification .
high frequency ( hf ) and very high frequency ( vhf ) radars ( a - and b-band ) :
these radar band below 300mhz represent the frontier of radio technology at the time during the world war ii .
however , in the modern radar era , these frequency band be use for early warning radar .
these radar utilize the electromagnetic wave ’ reflection off the ionosphere to detect target beyond the horizon , and so they be call over-the-horizon radars ( othr ) .
some example include the united states ( u.s. )
navy relocatable over-the-horizon radar ( rothr ) show in fig . 1.2 , and the russian woodpecker radar show in fig . 1.3 .
by use these low hf and vhf frequency band , one can use high-power transmitter .
at these frequency , the electromagnetic wave atmospheric attenuation be small and can be overcome by use high-power transmitter .
radar angular measurement accuracy be limit in these band because lower frequency require antenna with significant physical size , thus limit the radar ’s angle accuracy and angle resolution .
other communication and broadcasting service typically use these frequency band .
therefore , the available bandwidth for military radar system be limit and highly contest throughout the world .
low-frequency system can be use for foliage penetration ( fopen ) application , as well as in ground penetrate ( gpen ) application .
figure 1.2 . u. s. navy over-the-horizon radar .
figure 1.3 . russian woodpecker othr radar .
ultra high frequency ( uhf ) radars ( c-band ) : uhf band be use for very long range early warning radar ( ewr ) .
some example include the ballistic missile early warning system ( bmews ) search-and-track monopulse radar that operate at 245mhz ( see fig . 1.4 ) , the perimeter and acquisition radar ( par ) , which be a very long range multifunction phased array radar ; and the early warning pave paw multifunction uhf phase array radar .
this frequency band be also use for the detection and tracking of satellite and ballistic missile over a long range .
in recent year , ultra wideband ( uwb ) radar application use all frequency in the a - to c-band .
uwb radar can be use in gpen application as well as in see-through - the-wall application .
figure 1.4 . fylingdales bmews , united kingdom .
l-band radars ( d-band ) : radar in the l-band be primarily ground-based and ship - base system that be use in long range military and air traffic control search operation for up to 250 ( ~ 500km ) nautical mile .
therefore , due to earth curvature they maximum achievable range be limit when detect low-altitude target which can disappear very quickly below the horizon .
the air traffic management ( atm ) long-range surveillance radar like the air route surveillance radar ( arsr ) , work in this frequency band .
these radar system be relatively large and demand sizable footprint .
historically , the designator l-band be adopt since the “ l ” represent with large antenna or long range radar .
s-band radars ( e - and f-band ) : most ground - and ship-based medium range radar operate in the s-band .
for example , the airport surveillance radar ( asr ) use for air traffic control , and the ship-based u.s. navy aegis ( fig . 1.5 ) multifunction phased array be s-band radar , and the airborne warning and control system ( awacs ) show in fig . 1.6 .
the atmospheric attenuation in this band be higher than in the d-band , and they be also more susceptible to weather condition .
radar in this band usually need considerably high transmit power as compare to the lower-frequency radar in order to achieve maximum detection range .
even with the considerable weather susceptibility , the national weather service next generation doppler weather radar ( nexrad ) use a s-band radar , because it can see beyond a severe storm .
special airport surveillance radars ( asr ) use at some civilian airport be also in this band where they can detect aircraft for up to 60 nautical mile .
the designator s-band ( contrary to l-band ) be adopt since the “ s ” represent the smaller antenna or shorter range radar .
figure 1.5 . u. s. navy aegis .
figure 1.6 . u. s. air force awacs .
c-band radar ( g-band ) : many of the mobile military battlefield surveillance , missile - control and ground surveillance radar system operate in this band .
most weather radar system be also c-band radar .
medium range search and fire control military radar and metric instrumentation radar be c-band system .
in this band , the size of the antenna allow for achieve excellent angular accuracy and resolution .
performance of system operate in this band suffer severely from bad weather condition and to counter that , they often employ antenna feed with circular polarization .
x - and ku-band radars ( i - and j-bands ) : in the x-band frequency range ( 8 to 12ghz ) the relationship between the wave length and size of the antenna be considerably better than in lower-frequency band .
radar system that require fine target detection capability and yet can not tolerate the atmospheric attenuation of higher-frequency band be typically x-band .
the x - and ku-band be relatively popular radar frequency band for military application like airborne radar , since the small antenna size provide good performance .
missile guidance system use the ku-band ( i - and j-bands ) because of the convenient antenna size where weight be a limit requirement .
space bear or airborne imaging radar use in synthetic aperture radar ( sar ) for military electronic intelligence and civil geographic mapping typically use these frequency band .
finally , these frequency band be also widely use in maritime civil and military navigation radar .
k - and ka - band radars ( j - and k-band ) : these high-frequency band suffer severe weather and atmospheric attenuation .
therefore , radar utilize these frequency band be limit to short range application , such as police traffic radar , short range terrain avoidance , and terrain follow radar .
alternatively , the achievable angular accuracy and range resolution be superior to other band .
in atm application these radar be often call surface movement radar ( smr ) or airport surface detection equipment ( asde ) radar .
millimeter wave ( mmw ) radars ( v - and w-bands ) : radar operate in this frequency band also suffer from severe high atmospheric attenuation .
radar application be limit to very short range of up to a ten of meter .
in the w-band maximum attenuation occur at about 75ghz and at about 96ghz .
both of these frequency be use in practice primarily in automotive industry where very small radar ( ~ 75-76ghz ) be use for parking assistant , blind spot and brake assist .
some radar system operate at 96 to 98ghz be use as laboratory experimental or prototype system .
1.2 . pulsed and continuous wave ( cw ) radar
when the type of waveform be use as a classifier of radar system , there be two type of radar ; pulsed and continuous wave ( cw ) radar system .
continuous wave radar be those that continuously emit electromagnetic energy , and use separate transmit and receive antenna .
unmodulated cw radar can accurately measure target radial velocity ( doppler shift ) and angular position .
continuous wave waveform can be view as pure sinewave of the form cos2πf0t .
spectra of the radar echo from stationary target and clutter will be concentrate around f0 .
the center frequency for the echo of a move target will be shift by fd , the doppler frequency .
thus , by measure this frequency difference , cw radar can very accurately extract target radial velocity .
because of the continuous nature of cw emission , range measurement be not possible without some modification to the radar operation and waveform .
simply put , target range information can not be extract without utilize some form of modulation .
the primary use of cw radar be in target velocity search and track , and in missile guidance operation .
pulsed radar use a train of pulsed waveform ( mainly with modulation ) .
in this category , radar system can be classify on the basis of the pulse repetition frequency ( prf ) , as low prf , medium prf , and high prf radar .
low prf radar be primarily use for range where target velocity ( doppler shift ) be not of interest .
high prf radar be mainly use to measure target velocity .
continuous wave as well as pulsed radar can measure both target range and radial velocity by utilize different modulation scheme .
the design , operation , and analysis of cw and pulsed radar system be find in subsequent chapter of this book .
1.3 . range
figure 1.7 show a simplify pulsed radar block diagram .
the time control box generate the synchronization timing signal require throughout the system .
a modulate signal be generate and send to the antenna by the modulator/transmitter block .
switch the antenna between the transmit and receive mode be control by the duplexer .
the duplexer allow one antenna to be use to both transmit and receive .
during transmission it direct the radar electromagnetic energy toward the antenna .
alternatively , on reception , it direct the receive radar echo to the receiver .
the receiver amplify the radar return and prepare they for signal processing .
extraction of target information be perform by the signal processor block .
the target ’s range , r , be compute by measure the time delay , δt ; it take a pulse to travel the two-way path between the radar and the target .
since electromagnetic wave travel at the speed of light , c = 3 × 108 m/s , then . . . where r be in meter and δt be in seconds .
the factor of 1/2 be use to account for the two-way time delay .
in general , a pulsed radar transmit and receive a train of pulse , as illustrate by fig . 1.8 .
the inter pulse period ( ipp ) be t , and the pulse width be τ .
the ipp be often refer to as the pulse repetition interval ( pri ) .
the inverse of the pri be the prf , which be denote by ft , . . .
during each pri the radar radiate energy only for . . . seconds and listen for target return for the rest of the pri .
the radar transmit duty cycle ( factor ) dt be define as the ratio . . . .
2 mathematical modeling of control systems
2.1 introduction
in study control system the reader must be able to model dynamic system in mathematical term and analyze they dynamic characteristic .
a mathematical model of a dynamic system be define as a set of equation that represent the dynamics of the system accurately , or at least fairly well .
note that a mathematical model be not unique to a give system .
a system may be represent in many different way and , therefore , may have many mathematical model , depend on one ’s perspective .
the dynamics of many system , whether they be mechanical , electrical , thermal , economic , biological , and so on , may be describe in term of differential equation .
such differential equation may be obtain by use physical law govern a particular system -- for example , newton ’s law for mechanical system and kirchhoff ’s law for electrical system .
we must always keep in mind that derive reasonable mathematical model be the most important part of the entire analysis of control system .
throughout this book we assume that the principle of causality apply to the system consider .
this mean that the current output of the system ( the output at time t = 0 ) depend on the past input ( the input for t ' 0 ) but do not depend on the future input ( the input for t ' 0 ) .
mathematical model .
mathematical model may assume many different form .
depend on the particular system and the particular circumstance , one mathematical model may be better suit than other model .
for example , in optimal control problem , it be advantageous to use state-space representation .
on the other hand , for the transient-response or frequency-response analysis of single-input , single-output , linear , time-invariant system , the transfer-function representation may be more convenient than any other .
once a mathematical model of a system be obtain , various analytical and computer tool can be use for analysis and synthesis purpose .
simplicity versus accuracy .
in obtain a mathematical model , we must make a compromise between the simplicity of the model and the accuracy of the result of the analysis .
in derive a reasonably simplify mathematical model , we frequently find it necessary to ignore certain inherent physical property of the system .
in particular , if a linear lumped-parameter mathematical model ( that be , one employ ordinary differential equation ) be desire , it be always necessary to ignore certain nonlinearity and distribute parameter that may be present in the physical system .
if the effect that these ignore property have on the response be small , good agreement will be obtain between the result of the analysis of a mathematical model and the result of the experimental study of the physical system .
in general , in solve a new problem , it be desirable to build a simplify model so that we can get a general feeling for the solution .
a more complete mathematical model may then be build and use for a more accurate analysis .
we must be well aware that a linear lumped-parameter model , which may be valid in low-frequency operation , may not be valid at sufficiently high frequency , since the neglect property of distribute parameter may become a important factor in the dynamic behavior of the system .
for example , the mass of a spring may be neglect in low-frequency operation , but it become a important property of the system at high frequency .
( for the case where a mathematical model involve considerable error , robust control theory may be apply .
robust control theory be present in chapter 10 . )
linear systems .
a system be call linear if the principle of superposition apply .
the principle of superposition state that the response produce by the simultaneous application of two different force function be the sum of the two individual response .
hence , for the linear system , the response to several input can be calculate by treat one input at a time and add the result .
it be this principle that allow one to build up complicated solution to the linear differential equation from simple solution .
in a experimental investigation of a dynamic system , if cause and effect be proportional , thus imply that the principle of superposition hold , then the system can be consider linear .
linear time-invariant systems and linear time-varying systems .
a differential equation be linear if the coefficient be constant or function only of the independent variable .
dynamic system that be compose of linear time-invariant lumped-parameter component may be describe by linear time-invariant differential equation -- that be , constant-coefficient differential equation .
such system be call linear time-invariant ( or linear constant-coefficient ) system .
systems that be represent by differential equation whose coefficient be function of time be call linear time-varying system .
a example of a time-varying control system be a spacecraft control system .
( the mass of a spacecraft change due to fuel consumption . )
in control theory , function call transfer function be commonly use to characterize the input-output relationship of component or system that can be describe by linear , time-invariant , differential equation .
we begin by define the transfer function and follow with a derivation of the transfer function of a differential equation system .
then we discuss the impulse-response function .
2.2.1 transfer function .
the transfer function of a linear , time-invariant , differential equation system be define as the ratio of the laplace transform of the output ( response function ) to the laplace transform of the input ( drive function ) under the assumption that all initial condition be zero .
consider the linear time-invariant system define by the follow differential equation : . . . where y be the output of the system and x be the input .
the transfer function of this system be the ratio of the laplace transform output to the laplace transform input when all initial condition be zero , or . . .
by use the concept of transfer function , it be possible to represent system dynamics by algebraic equation in s.
if the highest power of s in the denominator of the transfer function be equal to n , the system be call a nth-order system .
2.2.2 comment on transfer function .
the applicability of the concept of the transfer function be limit to linear , time-invariant , differential equation system .
the transfer function approach , however , be extensively use in the analysis and design of such system .
in what follow , we shall list important comment concern the transfer function .
( note that a system refer to in the list be one describe by a linear , time-invariant , differential equation . )
1 . the transfer function of a system be a mathematical model in that it be a operational method of express the differential equation that relate the output variable to the input variable .
2 . the transfer function be a property of a system itself , independent of the magnitude and nature of the input or drive function .
3 . the transfer function include the unit necessary to relate the input to the output ; however , it do not provide any information concern the physical structure of the system .
( the transfer function of many physically different system can be identical . )
4 . if the transfer function of a system be know , the output or response can be study for various form of input with a view toward understand the nature of the system .
5 . if the transfer function of a system be unknown , it may be establish experimentally by introduce known input and study the output of the system .
once establish , a transfer function give a full description of the dynamic characteristic of the system , as distinct from its physical description .
2.2.3 convolution integral .
for a linear , time-invariant system the transfer function g ( s ) be . . . where x ( s ) be the laplace transform of the input to the system and y ( s ) be the laplace transform of the output of the system , where we assume that all initial condition involve be zero .
it follow that the output y ( s ) can be write as the product of g ( s ) and x ( s ) , or . . .
note that multiplication in the complex domain be equivalent to convolution in the time domain ( see appendix a ) , so the inverse laplace transform of equation ( 2-1 ) be give by the follow convolution integral : . . . where both g ( t ) and x ( t ) be 0 for t ' 0 .
2.2.4 impulse-response function .
consider the output ( response ) of a linear time-invariant system to a unit-impulse input when the initial condition be zero .
since the laplace transform of the unit-impulse function be unity , the laplace transform of the output of the system be . . .
the inverse laplace transform of the output give by equation ( 2.2 ) give the impulse response of the system .
the inverse laplace transform of g ( s ) , or . . . be call the impulse-response function .
this function g ( t ) be also call the weighting function of the system .
the impulse-response function g ( t ) be thus the response of a linear time-invariant system to a unit-impulse input when the initial condition be zero .
the laplace transform of this function give the transfer function .
therefore , the transfer function and impulse-response function of a linear , time-invariant system contain the same information about the system dynamics .
it be hence possible to obtain complete information about the dynamic characteristic of the system by exciting it with a impulse input and measure the response .
( in practice , a pulse input with a very short duration compare with the significant time constant of the system can be consider a impulse . )
2.3 automatic control system
a control system may consist of a number of component .
to show the function perform by each component , in control engineering , we commonly use a diagram call the block diagram .
this section first explain what a block diagram be .
next , it discuss introductory aspect of automatic control system , include various control action .
then , it present a method for obtain block diagram for physical system , and , finally , discuss technique to simplify such diagram .
2.3.1 block diagrams .
a block diagram of a system be a pictorial representation of the function perform by each component and of the flow of signal .
such a diagram depict the interrelationship that exist among the various component .
differ from a purely abstract mathematical representation , a block diagram have the advantage of indicate more realistically the signal flow of the actual system .
in a block diagram all system variable be link to each other through functional block .
the functional block or simply block be a symbol for the mathematical operation on the input signal to the block that produce the output .
the transfer function of the component be usually enter in the corresponding block , which be connect by arrow to indicate the direction of the flow of signal .
note that the signal can pass only in the direction of the arrow .
thus a block diagram of a control system explicitly show a unilateral property .
figure 2-1 show a element of the block diagram .
the arrowhead point toward the block indicate the input , and the arrowhead lead away from the block represent the output .
such arrow be refer to as signal .
note that the dimension of the output signal from the block be the dimension of the input signal multiply by the dimension of the transfer function in the block .
the advantage of the block diagram representation of a system be that it be easy to form the overall block diagram for the entire system by merely connect the block of the component accord to the signal flow and that it be possible to evaluate the contribution of each component to the overall performance of the system .
in general , the functional operation of the system can be visualize more readily by examine the block diagram than by examine the physical system itself .
a block diagram contain information concern dynamic behavior , but it do not include any information on the physical construction of the system .
consequently , many dissimilar and unrelated system can be represent by the same block diagram .
it should be note that in a block diagram the main source of energy be not explicitly show and that the block diagram of a give system be not unique .
a number of different block diagram can be draw for a system , depend on the point of view of the analysis .
chapter 3 autoimmunity and autoimmune disease
one of the central feature of the immune system be the capacity to mount a inflammatory response to nonself while avoid harm to self tissue .
while recognition of self play a important role in shape the repertoire of immune receptor on both t and b cell , and in the clearance of apoptotic debris from tissue throughout the body , the development of potentially harmful immune response to self-antigen be , in general , preclude .
the essential feature of a autoimmune disease be that tissue injury be cause by the immunologic reaction of the organism against its own tissue .
autoimmunity , on the other hand , refer merely to the presence of antibody or t lymphocyte that react with self-antigen and do not necessarily imply that the self-reactivity have pathogenic consequence .
autoimmunity be present in all individual ; however , autoimmune disease represent the end result of the breakdown of one or more of the basic mechanism regulate immune tolerance .
autoimmunity be see in normal individual and in higher frequency in normal older people .
polyreactive autoantibody that recognize many host antigen be present throughout life .
expression of these antibody may be increase follow some incite event .
these be usually of the igm heavy chain isotype and be encode by nonmutated germline immunoglobulin variable region gene .
when autoimmunity be induce by a incite event , such as infection or tissue damage from trauma or ischemia , the autoreactivity be in general self-limited .
such autoimmunity may , however , be persistent , and then may or may not result in ensue pathology .
even in the presence of organ pathology , it may be difficult to determine whether the damage be mediate by autoreactivity .
follow a incite event , the development of self-reactivity may be the consequence of a ongoing pathologic process , and be non-pathogenic , or may contribute to tissue inflammation and damage .
mechanism of autoimmunity
since ehrlich first postulate the existence of mechanism to prevent the generation of self-reactivity in 1900 , idea concern the nature of this inhibition have develop in parallel with a progressive increase in understanding of the immune system .
burnet 's clonal selection theory include the idea that interaction of lymphoid cell with they specific antigen during fetal or early postnatal life would lead to elimination of such " forbid clone . "
this idea become untenable , however , when it be show that autoimmune disease could be induce in experimental animal by simple immunization procedure , that autoantigen-binding cell could be demonstrate easily in the circulation of normal individual , and that self-limited autoimmune phenomenon frequently develop follow tissue damage from infection or trauma .
these observation indicate that clone of cell capable of respond to autoantigen be present in the repertoire of antigen-reactive cell in normal adult and suggest that mechanism in addition to clonal deletion be responsible for prevent they activation .
currently , three general process be think to be involve in the maintenance of selective unresponsiveness to autoantigen ( table 3-1 ) : ( 1 ) sequestration of self-antigen , render they inaccessible to the immune system ; ( 2 ) specific unresponsiveness ( tolerance or anergy ) of relevant t or b cell ; and ( 3 ) limitation of potential reactivity by regulatory mechanism .
derangement of these normal process may predispose to the development of autoimmunity ( table 3-2 ) .
in general , these abnormal response require a exogenous trigger such as bacterial or viral infection or cigarette smoking and require the presence of endogenous abnormality in the cell of the immune system .
microbial superantigen , such as staphylococcal protein a and staphylococcal enterotoxin , be substance that can stimulate a broad range of t and b cell base upon specific interaction with select family of immune receptor , irrespective of they antigen specificity .
if autoantigen-reactive t and/or b cell express these receptor , autoimmunity might develop .
alternatively , molecular mimicry or cross-reactivity between a microbial product and a self-antigen might lead to activation of autoreactive lymphocyte .
one of the best example of autoreactivity and autoimmune disease result from molecular mimicry be rheumatic fever , in which antibody to the m protein of streptococcus cross-react with myosin , laminin , and other matrix protein as well as neuronal antigen .
deposition of these autoantibody in the heart initiate a inflammatory response , whereas penetration of these antibody into the brain can result in sydenham 's chorea .
molecular mimicry between microbial protein and host tissue have be report in type 1 diabetes mellitus , rheumatoid arthritis , and multiple sclerosis .
it be presume that infectious agent may be able to overcome self-tolerance because they possess molecule , such as bacterial endotoxin , rna , or dna , that have adjuvant-like effect on the immune system that increase the immunogenicity of the microbial antigen .
the adjuvant activate dendritic cell through pattern recognition receptor and stimulate the activation of previously quiescent lymphocyte that recognize both microbial and self-antigen .
endogenous derangement of the immune system may also contribute to the loss of immunologic tolerance to self-antigen and the development of autoimmunity ( table 3-2 ) .
some autoantigen reside in immunologically privileged site , such as the brain or the anterior chamber of the eye .
these site be characterize by the inability of engraft tissue to elicit immune response .
immunologic privilege result from a number of event , include the limited entry of protein from those site into lymphatic , the local production of immunosuppressive cytokine such as transform growth factor . . . , and the local expression of molecule such as fa ligand that can induce apoptosis of activate t cell .
lymphoid cell remain in a state of immunologic ignorance ( neither activate nor anergize ) to protein express uniquely in immunologically privileged site .
if the privileged site be damage by trauma or inflammation , or if t cell be activate elsewhere , protein express at this site can become the target of immunologic assault .
such a event may occur in multiple sclerosis and sympathetic ophthalmia , in which antigen uniquely express in the brain and eye , respectively , become the target of activate t cell .
alteration in antigen presentation may also contribute to autoimmunity .
peptide determinant ( epitope ) of a self-antigen that be not routinely present to lymphocyte may be recognize as a result of altered proteolytic processing of the molecule and the ensue presentation of novel peptide ( cryptic epitope ) .
when b cell rather than dendritic cell present self-antigen , they may also present cryptic epitope that can activate autoreactive t cell .
these cryptic epitope will not have previously be available to effect the silencing of autoreactive lymphocyte .
furthermore , once there be immunologic recognition of one protein component of a multimolecular complex , reactivity may be induce to other component of the complex follow internalization and presentation of all molecule within the complex ( epitope spread ) .
finally , inflammation , drug exposure , or normal senescence may cause a primary chemical alteration in protein , result in the generation of immune response that cross-react with normal self-protein .
for example , the induction and/or release of protein arginine deaminase enzyme result in the conversion of arginine residue to citrulline in a variety of protein , thereby alter they capacity to induce immune response .
production of anticitrullinated protein antibody have be observe in rheumatoid arthritis , chronic lung disease , as well as normal smoker and may contribute to organ pathology .
alteration in the availability and presentation of autoantigen may be important component of immunoreactivity in certain model of organ-specific autoimmune disease .
in addition , these factor may be relevant in understand the pathogenesis of various drug-induced autoimmune condition .
however , the diversity of autoreactivity manifest in non-organ-specific systemic autoimmune disease suggest that these condition might result from a more general activation of the immune system rather than from a alteration in individual self-antigen .
many autoimmune disease be characterize by the presence of antibody that react with apoptotic material .
defect in the clearance of apoptotic material have be show to elicit autoimmunity and autoimmune disease in a number of animal model .
moreover , defect in the clearance of apoptotic material have be find in subject with systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) .
apoptotic debris not quickly clear by the immune system can function as endogenous ligand for a number of pattern recognition receptor on dendritic cell .
under such circumstance , there be activation of dendritic cell , and a immune response to apoptotic debris can develop .
in addition , the presence of extracellular apoptotic material within germinal center of secondary lymphoid organ may facilitate the direct activation of autoimmune b cell clone or function to select autoimmune b cell clone during immune response .
a number of experimental model have suggest that intense stimulation of t lymphocyte can produce nonspecific signal that bypass the need for antigen-specific helper t cell and lead to polyclonal b cell activation with the formation of multiple autoantibody .
for example , antinuclear , antierythrocyte , and antilymphocyte antibody be produce during the chronic graft-versus-host reaction .
in addition , true autoimmune disease , include autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune complex – mediate glomerulonephritis , can also be induce in this manner .
while it be clear that such diffuse activation of helper t cell activity can cause autoimmunity , nonspecific stimulation of b lymphocyte can also lead to the production of autoantibody .
thus , the administration of polyclonal b cell activator , such as bacterial endotoxin , to normal mouse lead to the production of a number of autoantibody , include those direct to dna and igg ( rheumatoid factor ) .
moreover , excess baff can also cause t cell – independent b cell activation and heavy chain class switching and the development of autoimmunity .
sle , for example , can be induce in mouse through exuberant dendritic cell activation , a redundancy of tlr7 on the y chromosome ( bxsbyaa mouse ) or through exposure to cpg , a ligand for tlr 9 .
the ensue induction of inflammatory mediator can cause a switch from production of nonpathogenic igm autoantibody to pathogenic igg autoantibody in the absence of antigen-specific t cell help .
aberrant selection of the b or t cell repertoire at the time of antigen receptor expression can also predispose to autoimmunity .
for example , b cell immunodeficiency cause by a absence of the b cell receptor – associate kinase , bruton 's tyrosine kinase , lead to x-linked agammaglobulinemia .
this syndrome be characterize by reduce b cell activation , but also by diminish negative selection of autoreactive b cell probably cause by high level of baff , result in increase autoreactivity within a diminish b cell repertoire .
likewise , negative selection of autoreactive t cell in the thymus require expression of the autoimmune regulator ( aire ) gene that enable the expression of tissue-specific protein in thymic medullary epithelial cell .
peptide from these protein be express in the context of major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) molecule and mediate the elimination of autoreactive t cell .
the absence of aire gene expression lead to a failure of negative selection of autoreactive cell , autoantibody production , and severe inflammatory destruction of multiple organ .
individual deficient in aire gene expression develop autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy ( apeced ) .
primary alteration in the activity of t and/or b cell , cytokine imbalance , or defective immunoregulatory circuit may also contribute to the emergence of autoimmunity .
diminish production of tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) and interleukin ( il ) 10 have be report to be associate with the development of autoimmunity .
overproduction of type 1 interferon have also be associate with autoimmunity .
overexpression of co-stimulatory molecule on t cell similarly can lead to autoantibody production .
autoimmunity may also result from a abnormality of immunoregulatory mechanism .
observation make in both human autoimmune disease and animal model suggest that defect in the generation and expression of regulatory t cell activity may allow for the production of autoimmunity .
it have recently be appreciate that the ipex ( immunodysregulation , polyendocrinopathy , enteropathy x-linked ) syndrome result from the failure to express the foxp3 gene , which encode a molecule critical in the differentiation of regulatory t cell .
administration of normal regulatory t cell or factor derive from they can prevent the development of autoimmune disease in rodent model of autoimmunity .
abnormality in the function of regulatory t cell have be note in a number of human autoimmune disease , although it remain uncertain whether these be causative or be secondary abnormality owe to inflammation .
finally , recent datum indicate that b cell may also exert regulatory function , largely through the production of the cytokine il-10 .
deficiency of il - 10-producing regulatory b cell can prolong the course of a animal model of multiple sclerosis .
it should be apparent that no single mechanism can explain all the varied manifestation of autoimmunity .
furthermore , genetic evaluation have show that a number of abnormality often need to converge to induce a autoimmune disease .
