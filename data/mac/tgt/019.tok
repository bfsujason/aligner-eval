childbirth
one day mr. cheng go to wang qiyao 's after work to find she pale and flustered , lie down every so often and then get up to pace around .
she even knock over a glass , which shatter on the floor , but do not bother to pick up the piece .
mr. cheng hurry out to call a pedicab , come back in to help she downstairs , and then rush they off to the hospital .
have arrive at the hospital , she seem to improve , and mr. cheng go out to get something for they dinner .
by the time he get back , wang qiyao have already be take into the delivery room .
it be a baby girl .
she be bear at eight o'clock .
they tell mr. cheng that she have long arm and leg and a full head of black hair .
this set he wonder , just who do she look like ?
when , three day later , he bring mother and daughter home from the hospital , the threesome attract quite a few curious stare down the longtang .
mr. cheng have fetch wang qiyao 's mother the day before , set up a place for she on the sofa , and even go to the trouble of prepare a set of toiletries .
mrs. wang be silent the whole time , but , as mr. cheng busy himself with the household chore , she blurt out , " if only you have be the child 's father . . . "
mr. cheng tremble and almost lose hold of the thing in he hand .
he want to say something but he throat have close up .
by the time he be able to speak , he have forget what to say .
so he simply pretend that he have not hear .
when wang qiyao come home the next day , she mother have already prepare a pot of chicken broth and the customary bowl of soup with red jujube and longan , which be suppose to be so nourishing for new mother .
she hand the bowl to she daughter in silence .
she do not bother to even look at she granddaughter ; it be as if the child do not exist .
neighbor begin to call on they , but they be only the most casual of acquaintance — the only contact they normally have with wang qiyao be wave hello as she go in and out of the longtang ; now they come out of curiosity .
each one go on about how much the baby look like wang qiyao , all the while wonder who the father be .
go into the kitchen to fetch the hot water thermos , mr. cheng find mrs. wang standing in front of the window , look out at the overcast sky and quietly wipe away the tear .
mr. cheng have always think she a calculate woman .
back when he use to call on wang qiyao , she would never even bother to greet he but always send the maid down to talk to he at the door instead .
now , he sense , she be much closer to he , perhaps more understanding and sympathetic even than she daughter .
he stand behind she for a moment before offer a timid attempt at consolation .
" do not worry , auntie .
i 'll take care of she . "
with those word he could feel the tear well up and hasten back into the room with the hot water thermos .
the next day madame yan , who have not visit for age , come to see wang qiyao .
she have long hear of the pregnancy from she servant mama zhang , who have see wang qiyao come and go with that protrude belly of hers ; wang qiyao obviously be not worry about the rumor she pregnancy might stir up .
kang mingxun and sasha have by this time long vanish from the scene , one hide out at home while the other flee far away .
then , out of nowhere , appear this mr. cheng , who suddenly start come by at least three time a day .
although madame yan be not exactly sure what have transpire , she be not in the least bit take off guard ; in fact , she fancy herself one imbue with keen insight into the situation of woman like wang qiyao .
still , she be intrigue by mr. cheng .
she could tell from the fine quality of the old suit he wear that this mr. cheng have be a stylish man back in the old day .
she take he to be some kind of playboy whom wang qiyao must have know back in she dance hall day .
madame yan imagine all kind of thing about mr. cheng .
she have run into he a few time in the alley : he be always on he way to wang qiyao 's with snack like " stinky tofu , " and would always rush briskly past lest the food get cold .
the grease from the tofu have already soak the bottom of the bag and be about to drip through .
madame yan be touch , even somewhat jealous of wang qiyao for have such a devoted friend .
hearing that wang qiyao have give birth , she be move to sympathy ; be a woman , she could relate to how difficult thing must have be for wang qiyao , and decide to go over to see how she be .
mrs. wang , sense that madame yan be a cut above the other , feel favor by the visit and try to make herself pleasant .
she even brew some tea and sit down with madame yan .
with mr. cheng away at work , these three woman of different generation compare note about the hardship of childbirth .
wang qiyao mostly just sit and listen , as if the shady circumstance surround the father of she child prevent she from claim she share of the glory .
she mother and madame yan , on the other hand , vividly recall every detail from earlier decade .
when mrs. wang start to speak about how hard it be give birth to wang qiyao , the irony of the present situation be not lose on she and she eye redden .
she quickly find a excuse to scurry off into the kitchen , leave the other two in a awkward silence .
the baby have just be feed and be deep in sleep , she outline barely visible in the candle light .
wang qiyao have be look down as she pick she fingernail , but she abruptly raise she head and laugh .
it be a tragic laugh that affect even madame yan .
" madame yan , i really appreciate you come to see i . . . especially after all that be happen .
i be worry you would look down on i , " wang qiyao say .
" oh , cut it out , wang qiyao ! " reply madame yan .
" nobody be look down on you !
i be call on kang mingxun in a few day and i be go to see to it that he come to see you . "
at the mention of he name , wang qiyao turn away .
it be only after a long silence that she reply , " that be right , it be be age since i have see he . "
madame yan grow suspicious , but be force to keep she thought to herself ; instead she casually suggest that they all get together again .
" it be a pity that sasha 's no longer around .
he must be off in siberia eat he russian bread !
but that be okay , you can bring along that new friend of yours and we 'll have a foursome for we mahjong game . "
she take the opportunity to ask wang qiyao the gentleman 's name , he age , where he be from , and where he work , all of which wang qiyao respond to matter-of-factly .
at that point madame yan ask bluntly , " he be so loyal to you , and neither of you be get any younger ....
why do not you just get marry ? "
wang qiyao respond with another laugh .
raising she head , she look madame yan straight in the eye .
" a woman like i . . . .
how could i talk of marriage ? "
the next day , kang mingxun indeed come by to call on wang qiyao .
although she have expect he to show up after madame yan 's visit , she be still catch by surprise .
stand there face to face , neither know what to say .
mrs. wang size up the situation and decide it be best to give they some privacy , but slam the door shut on she way out to register she disapproval .
but wang qiyao and kang mingxun do not even notice .
this be the first time they have be together since they parting .
it feel like thousand of year since they have last see each other .
they have appear in each other 's dream , but the image in they dream be so far from the real person that they would have be better off not even dream .
they have , in truth , resolve not to think of each other — and succeed .
but , face to face once again , they discover that let go be not as easy as they have think .
they stand there for a moment before kang mingxun walk around to the other side of the bed to take a look at the baby .
wang qiyao stop he .
when he ask why he should not see the baby , she say , " because i say so . . . . "
kang mingxun press for a explanation .
wang qiyao say that it be not he baby .
they fall silent for a while before he say , " well , whose be it then , if it be not mine ? "
" sasha 's . "
at that , the two of they break down in tear .
all the sorrow they have suppress back when they have to make that difficult decision suddenly come rush back ; they wonder how they have ever get through everything that have bring they to this point .
" i be so sorry . . . i be so sorry . . . . "
kang mingxun keep apologize , know it would do no good even if he say it a thousand time over .
wang qiyao keep shake she head , aware that if she do not accept the apology , she would have nothing at all .
they be both in tear , but it be wang qiyao who stop cry first .
wipe away she tear , she insist , " she really be sasha 's child . "
hear she say this , kang mingxun also pull back he tear and sit himself down .
there be no more mention of the baby ; it be as if she have cease to exist .
wang qiyao have kang mingxun make himself some tea and , as he busy himself , she ask he what he have be do of late — do he still play bridge ?
be there any news on the job front ?
" for the past few month , it feel like i have be do only one thing — wait in line .
i get in line at nine thirty every morning to get into the chinese restaurant .
then i line up again around four at a western restaurant .
sometimes i have to line up just to get a cup of coffee or a quick bite , like a bowl of rice with salt pork . "
he explain that he be the one who usually get stick hold a place in line for the rest of the family ; once it get to close to he turn , everyone else would show up .
" everyone talk about there not be enough to eat , but i feel like all i do all day long be eat ! "
wang qiyao take a closer look at he and jokingly observe , " you have be eat so much that you be start to grow gray . "
" i do not think that be from eat too much — it be from miss someone too much .... "
wang qiyao roll she eye .
" oh no , i be not sing rendezvous at the pavilion with you again ! "
they seem to have slip back into they old way — except that there be this new addition asleep on the bed .
sparrow be peck at crumb on the windowsill and they could hear someone forcefully shake out a comforter on a nearby balcony .
kang mingxun be just on he way out as mr. cheng come back from work .
pass on the stair , they exchange a quick glance but neither leave much of a impression on the other .
it be not until he get inside that wang qiyao explain that the man be she neighbor madame yan 's cousin , the one she use to spend time with .
" it be almost dinner time .
how come you do not ask he to stay for dinner ? "
mr. cheng ask .
" we really do not have anything special to entertain a guest ... so i think it would be rude to invite he , " she explain .
mrs. wang keep quiet but have a disgusted look on she face .
she go out of she way to be nice to mr. cheng , who wonder who have cross she — he know it be not he .
as usual , he spend some time play with the baby after dinner .
see the baby fed and contentedly asleep with she tiny fist in she mouth , he take he leave .
it be around eight o'clock .
people and car pass back and forth under the bright city light .
instead of take the trolley , mr. cheng drape he fall coat over he arm and walk home .
he take in the familiar scent of the city and soak up the evening scene .
now that the burden weigh on he for so long have be finally lift , he feel relax : mother and child be safe and sound and the baby do not bother he as he have originally fear .
in fact , mr. cheng be strike with a peculiar happiness ; it be as if he , and not the child , have be give a new lease on life .
the late show be about to begin at the cinema , which add a feeling of excitement to the night air .
the city still have the spirit of a night owl , and the same energy of year ago be still there .
the tricolor revolving pole outside the barbershop be the emblem of this unsleeping city .
the strong aroma of brazilian coffee waft out of old chang 's give the impression that time be flow backward .
how exciting the night be !
desire and contentment abound and , despite the compromise that have to be make , everyone give they all , live life to the fullest .
mr. cheng 's eye grow moist and a strange excitement well up in he heart , the like of which he have not experience in a long time .
the next time kang mingxun show up , mrs. wang do not go into the kitchen to avoid he .
she sit on the sofa read a cartoon version of the dream of the red chamber .
wang qiyao and kang mingxun could not help but feel awkward and fall back on make small talk about the weather .
when the baby wake up cry , wang qiyao ask kang mingxun to hand she a clean diaper .
to she dismay , she mother get up and , take the diaper out of kang mingxun 's hand , scold she .
" how could you have the gentleman do this kind of thing ? "
" i do not mind , " explain kang mingxun .
" it be not like i be busy with anything else . . . . "
" right , let he help out , " wang qiyao add .
mrs. wang draw a long face .
" do not you have any manners ?
how could you ask a gentleman like he to lay he hand on these filthy article ?
he be decent enough to treat you with respect and come to visit ; but do not take it as a sign that you can walk all over he .
show some tact ! "
stun by the innuendo in she mother 's sudden attack , wang qiyao burst into tear .
mrs. wang become even more incensed .
she fling the diaper in she daughter 's face , scream , " i try to help you save face , but you just do not seem to care !
you demean yourself , and it be all you own do !
if you want to lead a life of shame , go ahead !
nobody 's go to be able to help you if you do not help yourself ! "
with that , mrs. wang also burst out cry .
kang mingxun be thoroughly bemused ; he have no idea what have bring this on .
not know what else to do , he set about try to mollify mrs. wang , " please do not be upset , auntie .
you know that wang qiyao have a good heart . . . . "
he word make mrs. wang laugh .
she turn to he , " mister , you be very perceptive .
wang qiyao do indeed have a good heart .
she have no choice .
where would she be if she do not have a good heart ? "
suddenly kang mingxun realize that he be the object of she wrath .
he step back and stammer something inaudible .
at this point , the baby , whom no one have be tend to , begin to howl .
of the four people in the room , three be now in tear .
aghast at the chaos , kang mingxun feel impel to say , " it be less than a month since wang qiyao give birth .
she should still be rest and we should try not to make she upset . "
mrs. wang laugh coldly .
" oh , so wang qiyao should be rest this month , should she ?
that be funny , i do not know .
with no man around to rely on , how be she suppose to be able to rest ?
will you explain that to i ? "
those word bring a abrupt end to wang qiyao 's tear .
when she have finish change and feed the baby , she say , " mom , you say i lack tact ; but what about you ?
how do you think it look when you say such thing in front of we guest ?
after all , it be not as if he have anything to do with we family .
you be the one who be demeaning i — and yourself !
at any rate , i 'll always be you daughter ! "
mrs. wang be dumbstruck .
by the time she be ready to respond , wang qiyao cut she off .
" this gentleman have the decency to come by and pay he respects .
i would never dream of make any unseemly demand on he — and neither should you !
all my life i have have no one to rely on but myself ; i make no other claim besides that .
i be sorry to have trouble you to help out during this difficult time , but i promise you that i will repay you for you trouble . "
she remark be direct at she mother , but they be also mean for kang mingxun .
mother and daughter both fall silent for a time , until ms. wang wipe away she tear and murmur bleakly , " i see i have be worry too much .
well , you be almost through you first month , and it look like i be no longer need here . "
even as she speak , she begin to gather up she personal effect .
neither wang qiyao nor kang mingxun dare say a word to persuade she to stay .
they watch in shock as she pack she thing and place a red envelope on the baby 's chest .
she go out the door and down the stair ; then they hear the sound of the downstairs door closing , and she be go .
inside the red envelope be 200 yuan and a gold pendant .
when mr. cheng arrive , he find wang qiyao out of bed cooking dinner in the kitchen .
he ask where mrs. wang have go .
wang qiyao tell he that she father be not feel well and , since it be already almost a month since the birth , she have persuade she mother to go home to look after he .
mr. cheng notice she swollen eye and guess that she have be cry , but he decide not to press she and simply let thing go at that .
with mrs. wang go , the mood that evening be a bit dull .
wang qiyao be not very talkative and answer mr. cheng 's question absentmindedly , leave she guest rather down .
mr. cheng sit off to one side and read the newspaper .
he read on for quite some time and the apartment grow quiet .
he think that wang qiyao must be asleep , but when he look over he see that she have prop she head against the pillow and be stare up at the ceiling , lose in thought .
he quietly approach to ask what she be think .
the last thing he expect be for she to jerk back and ask he what he want .
there be alarm in she eye and a distant look that make mr. cheng feel like a stranger .
he retreat to the sofa and go on with read he newspaper .
all of a sudden , rowdy noise break out from the longtang outside .
open the window to look out , mr. cheng see that a crowd have gather around a man hold up a weasel he have catch in he chicken coop .
after recount the beast 's crime , the man carry it toward the entrance to the longtang with the crowd follow close behind .
mr. cheng be about to close the window when he catch the scent of osmanthus blossom in the air ; it be not terribly strong , but the fragrance go straight to he heart .
he also notice the narrow span of sky above peace lane — a deep , deep blue .
he feel exhilarated .
turn to wang qiyao , he say , " let 's have a banquet to celebrate the child 's one-month birthday . "
wang qiyao do not say anything at first .
then , break into a smile : " be that cause for celebration ? "
" yes , " mr. cheng say more earnestly .
" a first-month birthday be always a happy and auspicious occasion ! "
" what be so happy and auspicious about it ? "
mr. cheng do not know how to answer .
although she have be the one to crush he excitement , he pity she .
wang qiyao roll over away from he .
after a pause , she continue , " let 's not fuss over this one-month celebration .
let 's simply make a few dish , buy a bottle of wine , and invite madame yan and she cousin over .
they have be good to i , come to see i and all . "
that be enough to put mr. cheng back in high spirit .
he ponder what kind of soup and dish they should serve .
wang qiyao object to virtually every one of he suggestion , and he have to start from scratch .
they become more animated as they argue back and forth about the menu and gradually thing go back to normal .
on the afternoon of the dinner mr. cheng leave work early to pick up the food for that evening .
they put the baby to bed early and chat as they cook .
mr. cheng see that wang qiyao be in a good mood , which also put he in a good mood .
they arrange the cold dish in a delightful pattern , garnish the plate with purple radish .
wang qiyao declare , " mr. cheng , you be not only a great photographer , but you can cook too ! "
" and you do not even mention what i be best at . . . "
" what be that ? "
" railroad engineering . "
" i practically forget you true calling .
you see , all along you have be entertain we with you hobby , and hide you real talent ! "
" it be not that i be try to hide it ....
i just never get the chance to show it off ! "
they jovial banter be interrupt by the guest , who have come bear gift .
madame yan bring a pound of cashmere yarn , and kang mingxun a pair of gold ingot .
wang qiyao want to tell he that he should not have give such a expensive gift , but be worry that madame yan would take that as a sign that she gift be not lavish enough , so she decide to accept they both and save she misgiving for another day .
everyone go inside to see the baby before dinner and they all comment on how precious she look .
since there be four of they , it work out perfectly when they sit down at the table , one person on each side .
this be the first time that mr. cheng have meet the evening 's guest .
madame yan have take note of he , but he have never notice she , and he have only pass kang mingxun on the staircase , when neither could get a good look at the other .
wang qiyao make the introduction and they proceed with dinner as if they be all acquaint .
madame yan already have a good impression of mr. cheng and be especially friendly toward he ; it be not long before she feel like they be old friend .
although mr. cheng be a bit overwhelmed by she warmth , he realize she have nothing but the best intention .
kang mingxun , on the other hand , be stiff and subdue .
he say little , focus on the warm rice wine .
they finish off the first bottle rather quickly and start on a second .
mr. cheng excuse himself so he could go to the kitchen to prepare another dish , but see he be a bit tipsy , wang qiyao put she hand on he shoulder , motion he to sit back down , and insist that she take care of it .
he gently caress the hand on he shoulder , but she instinctively pull it away .
kang mingxun , in spite of himself , flash mr. cheng a rather sharp glance .
the effect on mr. cheng be instantaneously sobering .
wang qiyao return to the table with the new dish she have just whip up .
by then even madame yan , whose cheek be red , be get a bit tipsy .
she propose a toast to mr. cheng , declare he a rare gentleman and even quote the old adage , " it be easier to find ten thousand ounce of gold than a true friend who can really understand you . "
she word be inappropriate to the occasion ; obviously , alcohol be bring out some hidden truth .
not content to propose a toast on she own , she insist that kang mingxun also drink to mr. cheng .
kang mingxun raise he cup but do not know quite what to say .
as the rest of the party wait anxiously , he finally come out with something that sound even more inappropriate .
" here be to mr. cheng soon find matrimonial bliss ! "
mr. cheng accept they toast with equanimity and a " thank you . "
then , turn to wang qiyao , he ask if she have anything to say .
wang qiyao be a bit disconcerted by the unfamiliar glint in he eye — she be not sure if it be the alcohol or something else — so she put on a placate smile .
" naturally , i should have be the first one to toast mr. cheng .
just as madame yan say , it be easier to find ten thousand ounce of gold than a true friend .
no one else here understand i the way mr. cheng do .
he have always be there for i during my most difficult time .
and for all the mistake i have make , he have always forgive i .
i owe he a debt of gratitude that i will never be able to repay . "
conscious that it be the alcohol that have embolden she to open up , mr. cheng could not help be at once deeply disappointed and hurt by she word ; all she speak of be gratitude , with not a word about love .
on the brink of tear , he lower he head .
only after a long pause do he manage to force a smile and say ,
" hey , we be not here to celebrate my one-month birthday !
why be everyone toast i ?
drink to wang qiyao would be more like it ! "
and so , with madame yan lead the way , they all toast wang qiyao .
but , perhaps because they have all talk too much already , no one have much leave to say .
so they just drink , one cup after another .
mr. cheng 's eye meet kang mingxun 's once again .
they stare mutely at each other , neither fully understand the circumstance .
but the seed of suspicion have be plant .
everyone drink more than they should have that evening .
mr. cheng could not remember how he have see the guest out or whether he have wash the dish after they leave .
he wake up to discover himself on wang qiyao 's sofa , a thin blanket drape over he .
leftover food be still on the table , and the room be fill with the sweet and sour fragrance of rice wine .
the moon shine through the curtain on he face be cool as water .
he feel utterly at peace as he watch the moonlight dancing on the curtain ; he decide to let he mind go blank and not worry about anything that have happen that night .
suddenly he hear a gentle voice ask , " would you care for some tea ? "
he follow the voice and see wang qiyao lie in bed across the room .
she have also wake up , but she face be obscure by the shadow and mr. cheng could only make out she silhouette .
mr. cheng do not feel awkward ; on the contrary , he be fill with a sense of serenity .
" i be so embarrassed ! " he say .
wang qiyao respond with a silent laugh .
" you fall asleep with you head on the table .
it take the three of we to get you onto the sofa . "
" i drink too much , " he say .
" but that be only because i be happy . "
after a silence , wang qiyao respond , " actually . . . you drink so much because you be upset . . . . "
mr. cheng laugh .
" what be there for i to be upset about ?
i be really happy . "
neither of they speak and gradually the moonlight shift a bit closer .
bath in the moonlight , mr. cheng have the sensation that he be lie in water .
quite some time pass , and he be certain that wang qiyao must have long fall asleep , when she suddenly call out he name .
he be surprise to hear she call he .
" what be it ? "
wang qiyao hesitate before ask , " can not you get to sleep ? "
" i think i get all the sleep i need when i pass out earlier ! "
" that be not what i mean . . . . "
" i think i know quite well what you mean , " insist mr. cheng .
" i do not think so . . . . "
mr. cheng laugh , " of course i do . "
" if you understand what i mean , then why do not you tell i ... ? "
" if that be what you want , i will then , " reply mr. cheng .
" you mean that all this time we have be but just one step away from take we relationship somewhere else .
and if i be to take that step , you would not refuse i . "
wang qiyao marvel at mr. cheng 's perceptiveness , especially since he usually come off so stiff and bookish .
embarrassed , she try to find a excuse to explain thing away .
" i know i do not deserve you . . . and that be why i want to wait for you to make the first move . "
mr. cheng laugh again .
he feel extremely relax , as if float on air .
when he speak , it feel almost as if someone else be do the talking , but the word that come out be indeed he deepest and most honest inner thought .
" we talk about take that one last step . . . .
well , i have be wait practically half my life to take that step .
but it be not as easy as it sound .
have you ever hear the say , ' people can be a short distance away , yet pole apart ' ?
there be a lot of thing in life that simply can not be force . "
wang qiyao remain silent and mr. cheng , unconcerned as to whether she be really listen , continue to pour out the feeling he have accumulate inside himself all those year .
he explain how he have long ago come to understand this principle .
so long as they could be close friend , confidant , he think , he life would not have be in vain .
but once people be together , it be as the say go : " a boat sailing against the current must forge ahead or else be drive back . "
" i would be lie if i say that i do not have the desire to forge ahead . . . but when the boat will not go forward anymore . . . all i can do be turn back . "
after a long silence , he suddenly ask , " kang mingxun be the father , be not he ? "
wang qiyao laugh , " what do it matter whether he be or not ? "
mr. cheng grow a bit self-conscious .
" i be only ask . "
the two of they turn over , away from each other , and before long they be both fast asleep , snore lightly .
the follow day mr. cheng do not show up at wang qiyao 's after work — he go to see jiang lili instead .
he have call she at she office , and they agree to meet on tilan bridge .
by the time mr. cheng arrive , jiang lili be already stand there wait , constantly look at she watch .
she have clearly arrive too early but insist on blame mr. cheng for be late .
mr. cheng refuse to argue with she .
they find a small restaurant nearby , go in , and order a few dish .
as soon as the waiter turn away , mr. cheng bent over the table and start to cry , a stream of tear fall steadily on the bleached table cloth .
jiang lili could pretty much figure out what have happen , but make no effort to comfort he .
all she offer be silence as she silently fix she gaze on the ashen wall , which have recently be stain a pale white .
at that moment , all mr. cheng be focus on be he own pain , and he make no effort to understand what jiang lili might be feeling .
even people as good-natured and generous as mr. cheng can become extremely selfish and unfair in love .
they tiptoe around they loved one , fearful of give offense ; but with the people who love they they be thoroughly inconsiderate and arrogant , behave like spoil brat .
this be what have motivate he to seek out jiang lili .
jiang lili do not speak for a long time .
then , see that he be still cry , she sneer , " what be wrong ?
go out and get you heart break , do you ? "
mr. cheng gradually stop cry and sit in silence .
jiang lili have the urge to taunt he further , but , take pity on he , soften up .
" you know , it seem like the harder we try to get something , the more elusive it become .
but when we do not want something , it end up fall into we lap . "
mr. cheng ask softly , " and what if one give up on something but it still remain elusive ? "
jiang lili be livid .
she raise she voice , " what , be all the woman in the world dead ?
do not tell i that i be the only one leave ?
send here to listen to you ramble on about you grievance over she ? "
mr. cheng lower he head contritely and be silent .
jiang lili also give up speak to he , and the two of they sit for some time in a awkward silence .
in the end , it be mr. cheng who continue .
" actually , i come here to ask a favor of you . . . .
i be not sure what make i break down like that .
i be so sorry . "
somewhat mollify , jiang lili tell he to go ahead and say what he have to say .
" i have be think about this for a long time , and you be the only one i can go to for help .
i know it be not right , but there be no one else i can turn to . "
" whatever it be , let 's hear it ! "
mr. cheng explain that he would never again visit wang qiyao .
he want to ask jiang lili to look out for she .
jiang lili do not know whether to be angry or bitter .
it take a long time before she manage to say , " well i guess all the woman in the world be dead . . . even i . "
