the location for the three body player ' meet-up be a small , out-of-the-way coffee shop .
wang have always imagine game meet-up would be lively event full of people , but this meet-up consist of only seven player , include himself .
like wang , the other six do not look like gaming enthusiast .
only two be relatively young .
another three , include a woman , be middle-aged .
there be also a old man who appear to be in he sixty or seventy .
wang have originally think that as soon as they meet they would begin a lively discussion of three body , but he be wrong .
the profound but strange content of three body have have a psychological impact on the participant .
all the player , include wang himself , could not bring it up easily .
they only make simple self-introduction .
the old man take out a refine pipe , fill it with tobacco , and smoke as he stroll around , admire the painting on the wall .
the other sit silently , wait for the meet-up organizer to show up .
they have all come early .
actually , of the six , wang already know two .
the old man be a famous scholar who have make he name by imbue eastern philosophy with the content of modern science .
the strangely dress woman be a famous writer , one of those rare novelist who write in a avant-garde style but still have many reader .
you could start one of she book on any page .
of the two middle-aged man , one be a vice president at china 's largest software company , plainly and casually dress so that he status be not obvious at all ; and the other be a high-level executive at the state power corporation .
of the two young man , one be a reporter with a major media outlet , and the other be a doctoral student in the science .
wang now realize that a considerable number of three body player be probably social elite like they .
the meet-up organizer show up not long after .
wang 's heart begin to beat faster as soon as he see the man : it be pan han , prime suspect for the murder of shen yufei .
he take out he phone when no one be look and text shi qiang .
" haha , everyone get here early ! "
pan greet they in a relax manner , as though nothing be wrong .
appear in the media , he usually look disheveled , like a vagrant , but today , he be dress sharply in a suit and dress shoe .
" you be just like i imagine .
three body be intend for people in you class because the common crowd can not appreciate its meaning and mood .
to play it well require knowledge and understanding that ordinary people do not possess . "
wang send out he text : spot pan han .
at yunhe coffee shop in xicheng district .
pan continue .
" everyone here be a excellent three body player .
you have the best score and be devote to it .
i believe that three body be already a important part of you life . "
" it be part of what keep i alive , " the young doctoral student say .
" i see it by accident on my grandson 's computer , " the old philosopher say , lift he pipe stem .
" the young man abandon it after a few try , say it be too abstruse .
but i be attract to it .
i find it strange , terrible , but also beautiful .
so much information be hide beneath a simple representation . "
a few player nod at this description , include wang himself .
wang receive da shus 's reply text : we also see he .
no worry .
carry on .
play the fanatic in front of they , but not so much that you can not pull it off .
" yes , " the author agree , and nod .
" i like the literary element of three body .
the rise and fall of two hundred and three civilization evoke the quality of epic in a new form . "
she mention 203 civilization , but wang have only experienced 184 .
this tell wang that three body progress independently for each player , possibly with different world .
" i be a bit sick of the real world , " the young reporter say .
" three body be already my second reality . "
" really ? "
pan ask , interested .
" i too , " the software company vice president say .
" compare to three body , reality be so vulgar and unexciting . "
" it be too bad that it be only a game , " say the power company executive .
" very good , " pan say .
wang notice he eye sparkling with excitement .
" i have a question that i think everyone want to know the answer to , " wang say .
" i know what it be .
but you might as well ask . "
" be three body only a game ? "
the other player nod .
clearly the question be also on they mind .
pan stand up and say solemnly , " the world of three body , or trisolaris , really do exist . "
" where be it ? " several player ask in unison .
after look at each of they in turn , pan sit down and speak .
" some question i can answer .
other i can not .
but if you be mean to be with trisolaris , all you question will be answer someday . "
" then ... do the game really portray trisolaris accurately ? " the reporter ask .
" first , the ability of trisolarans to dehydrate through its many cycle of civilization be real .
in order to adapt to the unpredictable natural environment and avoid extreme environmental condition unsuitable for life , they can completely expel the water in they body and turn into dry , fibrous object . "
" what do trisolarans look like ? "
pan shake he head .
" i do not know .
i really do not .
in every cycle of civilization , the appearance of trisolarans be different .
however , the game do portray something else that really exist on trisolaris : the trisolaran-formation computer . "
" ha !
i think that be the most unrealistic aspect , " the software company vice president say .
" i conduct a test with more than a hundred employee at my company .
even if the idea work , a computer make of people would probably operate at a speed slower than manual computation . "
pan give a mysterious smile .
" you be right .
but suppose that of the thirty million soldier form the computer , each one be capable of raise and lower the black and white flag a hundred thousand time per second , and suppose also that the light cavalry soldier on the main bus can run at several time the speed of sound , or even faster .
then the result would be very different .
" you ask about the appearance of the trisolarans just now .
accord to some sign , the body of the trisolarans who form the computer be cover by a purely reflective surface , which probably evolve as a response to survival under extreme condition of sunlight .
the mirrorlike surface could be deform into any shape , and they communicate with each other by focus light with they body .
this kind of light-speech could transmit information extremely rapidly and be the foundation of the trisolaran-formation computer .
of course , this be still a very inefficient machine , but it be capable of complete calculation that be too difficult to be perform manually .
the computer do in fact make its first appearance in trisolaris as formation of people , before become mechanical and then electronic . "
pan stand up and pace behind the player .
" as a game , three body only borrow the background of human society to simulate the development of trisolaris .
this be do to give player a familiar environment .
the real trisolaris be very different from the world of the game , but the existence of the three sun be real .
they be the foundation of the trisolaran environment . "
" develop this game must have cost a enormous amount of effort , " the vice president say .
" but the goal be clearly not profit . "
" the goal of three body be very simple and pure : to gather those of we who have common ideal , " pan say .
" what ideal do we have in common , exactly ? "
wang immediately regret the question .
he wonder whether ask it sound hostile .
pan study everyone meaningfully , and then add in a soft voice , " how would you feel if trisolaran civilization be to enter we world ? "
" i would be happy . "
the young reporter be the first to break the silence .
" i have lose hope in the human race after what i have see in recent year .
human society be incapable of self-improvement , and we need the intervention of a outside force . "
" i agree ! " the author shout .
she be very excited , as though finally find a outlet for pent-up feeling .
" the human race be hideous .
i have spend the first half of my life unveiling this ugliness with the scalpel of literature , but now i be even sick of the work of dissection .
i yearn for trisolaran civilization to bring real beauty to this world . "
pan say nothing .
that glint of excitement appear in he eye again .
the old philosopher wave he pipe , which have go out .
he speak with a serious mien .
" let 's discuss this question with a bit more depth : what be you impression of the aztecs ? "
" dark and bloody , " the author say .
" blood-drenched pyramid light by insidious fire see through dark forest .
those be my impression . "
the philosopher nod .
" very good .
then try to imagine : if the spanish conquistador do not intervene , what would have be the influence of that civilization on human history ? "
" you be call black white and white black , " the software company vice president say .
" the conquistadors who invade the americas be nothing more than murderer and robber . "
" even so , at least they prevent the aztecs from develop without bind , turn the americas into a bloody , dark great empire .
then civilization as we know it would not have appear in the americas , and democracy would not have thrive until much later .
indeed , maybe they would not have appear at all .
this be the key to the question : no matter what the trisolarans be like , they arrival will be good news for the terminally ill human race . "
" but have you think through the fact that the aztecs be completely destroy by the western invader ? " the power company executive ask .
he look around , as though see these people for the first time .
" you thought be very dangerous . "
" you mean profound ! " the doctoral student say , raise a finger .
he nod vigorously at the philosopher .
" i have the same thought , but i do not know how to express it .
you say it so well ! "
after a moment of silence , pan turn to wang .
" the other six have all give they view .
what about you ? "
" i stand with they , " wang say , point to the reporter and the philosopher .
he keep he answer simple .
the less say the better .
" very good , " pan say .
he turn to the software company vice president and the power company executive .
" the two of you be no longer welcome at this meet-up , and you be no longer appropriate player for three body .
you id will be delete .
please leave now .
thank you . "
the two stand up and look at each other ; then glance around , confused , and leave .
pan hold out he hand to the remain five , shake each person 's hand in turn .
then he say , solemnly , " we be comrade now . "
