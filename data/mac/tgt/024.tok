" do not worry , " shi qiang say to wang , as he sit down next to he at the meeting table .
" i be not radioactive anymore .
the last couple of day they have wash i inside and outside like a flour sack .
they do not originally think you need to attend this meeting , but i insist .
heh .
i bet the two of we be go to be important this time . "
as da shus speak , he pick a cigar butt out of the ashtray , light it , and take a long drag .
he nod , and , in a slow , relax manner , blow the smoke into the face of the attendee sit on the other side of the table .
one of the people sit opposite he be the original owner of the cigar , colonel stanton of the u.s. marine corps .
he give da shus a contemptuous look .
many more foreign military officer be at this meeting than the last .
they be all in uniform .
for the first time in human history , the armed force of the world 's nation face the same enemy .
general chang say , " comrade , everyone at this meeting now have the same basic understanding of the situation .
or , as da shus here would put it , we have information parity .
the war between alien invader and humanity have begin .
we descendant will not face the trisolarans for another four and a half century .
for now , we opponent be still human .
yet , in essence , these traitor to the human race can also be see as enemy from outside human civilization .
we have never face a enemy like this .
the next war objective be very clear : we must capture the intercept trisolaran message store on judgment day .
these message may have great significance for we survival .
" we have not yet do anything to draw the suspicion of judgment day .
the ship still sail the atlantic freely .
it have already submit plan to the panama canal authority to pass through the canal in four day .
this be a great opportunity for we .
as the situation develop , such a opportunity may never arise again .
right now , all the battle command centers around the globe be draft up operation plan , and central will select one within ten hour and begin implementation .
the purpose of this meeting be to discuss possible plan of operation , and then report one to three of we best suggestion to central .
time be of the essence , and we must work efficiently .
" note that any plan must guarantee one thing : the secure capture of the trisolaran message .
judgment day be rebuild from a old tanker , and both the superstructure and the interior have be extensively renovate with complex structure to contain many new room and passageway .
supposedly even the crew rely on a map when enter unfamiliar area .
we , of course , know even less about the ship 's layout .
right now , we can not even be certain of the location of the computing center on judgment day , and we do not know whether the intercept trisolaran message be store in server locate in the computing center , or how many copy they have .
the only way to achieve we objective be to completely capture and control judgment day .
" the most difficult part be prevent the enemy from erase trisolaran datum during we attack .
destroy the datum would be very easy .
the enemy would not use conventional method to erase the datum during a attack , because it be easy to recover the datum use known technology .
but if they just empty a cartridge clip at the server hard drive or other storage media , it would all be over , and do so would take no more than ten seconds .
so we must disable all enemy near the storage equipment within ten seconds of they detect a attack .
since we do not know the exact location of the datum storage or the number of copy , we must eliminate all enemy on judgment day within a very brief period of time , before the target have be alert .
at the same time , we can not heavily damage the facility within , especially computer equipment .
thus , this be a very difficult task .
some think it be impossible . "
a japanese self-defense forces officer say , " we believe that the only chance for success be to rely on spy on judgment day .
if they be familiar with where the trisolaran information be store , they can control the area or move the storage equipment elsewhere right before we operation . "
someone ask , " reconnaissance and monitoring of judgment day have always be the responsibility of nato military intelligence and the cia .
do we have such spy ? "
" no , " the nato liaison say .
" then we have nothing more to discuss except bullshit , " say da shus .
he be meet with annoyed look .
colonel stanton say , " since the objective be eliminate all personnel within a enclosed structure without harm other equipment within , we first thought be to use a ball lightning weapon . "
ding yi shake he head .
" the existence of this kind of weapon be now public knowledge .
we do not know if the ship have be equip with magnetic wall to shield against ball lightning .
even if it have not , a ball lightning weapon can indeed kill all personnel within the ship , but it can not do so simultaneously .
also , after the ball lightning enter the ship , it may hover in the air for some time before release its energy .
this wait time can last from a dozen seconds to a minute or longer .
they will have enough time to realize they have be attack and destroy the datum . "
colonel stanton ask , " what about a neutron bomb ? "
" colonel , you should know that be not go to work . "
the speaker be a russian officer .
" the radiation from a neutron bomb can not kill right away .
after a neutron bomb attack , the amount of time leave to the enemy would be more than enough for they to have a meeting just like this one . "
" another thought be to use nerve gas , " a nato officer say .
" but release it and have it spread throughout the ship would take time , so it still do not achieve general chang 's requirement . "
" then the only choice leave be concussion bomb and infrasonic wave , " colonel stanton say .
other wait for he to finish he thought , but he say nothing more .
da shus say , " i use concussion bomb in police work , but they be toy .
they be indeed capable of stunning people inside a building into unconsciousness , but they be only good for a room or two .
do you have any concussion bomb big enough to stun a whole oil tanker full of people ? "
stanton shake he head .
" no. .
even if we do , such a large explosive device would certainly damage equipment inside the ship . "
" so what about infrasonic weapon ? " someone ask .
" they be still experimental and can not be use in live combat .
also , the ship be very large .
at the power level available to current experimental prototype , the most that a full assault on judgment day could do be to make the people inside feel dizzy and nauseous . "
" ha ! "
da shus extinguish the cigar butt , now as tiny as a peanut .
" i tell you all we have leave to discuss be bullshit .
we have be at it for a while now .
let 's remember what the general say : ' time be of the essence ! ' "
he give a sly grin to the translator , a female first lieutenant who look unhappy with he language .
" not easy to translate , eh , comrade ?
just get the approximate meaning across . "
but stanton seem to understand what he be say .
he point at shi qiang with a fresh cigar that he have just take out .
" who do this policeman think he be , that he can talk to we this way ? "
" who do you think you be ? "
da shus ask .
" colonel stanton be a expert in special op , " a nato officer say .
" he have be a part of every major military operation since the vietnam war . "
" then let i tell you who i be .
more than thirty year ago , my reconnaissance squad manage to sneak dozen of kilometer behind vietnamese line and capture a hydroelectric station under heavy guard .
we prevent the vietnamese plan to demolish the dam with explosive , which would have flood the attack route for we army .
that be who i be .
i defeat a enemy who once defeat you . "
" that be enough ! "
general chang slam the table .
" do not bring up irrelevant matter .
if you have a plan , say what it be . "
" i do not think we need to waste time on this policeman , "
colonel stanton say contemptuously , as he light he cigar .
without wait for a translation , da shi jump up .
" ' pao-li-si ' â€” i hear that word twice .
what ?
you look down on the police ?
if you be talk about drop some bomb and turn that ship into smithereens , yeah , you military be the expert .
but if you be talk about retrieve something out of it without damage , i do not care how many star be on you shoulder , you be not even as good as a thief .
for this kind of thing , you have to think outside the box .
out . of . the . box !
you will never be as good at it as criminal , master of out-of-the-box thinking .
" you know how good they be ?
i once handle a robbery where the criminal manage to steal one car out of a move train .
they reconnect the car before and after the one they be interested in so that the train get all the way to its destination without anyone notice .
the only tool they use be a length of wire cable and a few steel hook .
those be the real special op expert .
and someone like i , a criminal cop who have be play cat and mouse with they for more than a decade , have receive the best education and training from they . "
" tell we you plan , then , " general chang say .
" otherwise , shut up ! "
" there be so many important people here that i do not think it be my place to speak .
and i be afraid that you , general , would say i be be rude again . "
" you be already the definition of rudeness .
enough !
tell i what you out-of-the-box plan be . "
da shus pick up a pen and draw two parallel curve on the table .
" that be the canal . "
he put the ashtray between the two line .
" this be judgment day . "
then he reach across the table and pull colonel stanton 's just-lit cigar out of he mouth .
" i can no longer tolerate this idiot ! " the colonel shout , stand up .
" da shus , get out of here ! " general chang say .
" give i one minute .
i 'll be do soon . "
da shus extend a hand in front of colonel stanton .
" what do you want ? " the colonel ask , puzzle .
" give i another one . "
stanton hesitate for a second before take another cigar out of a beautiful wooden box and hand it to da shus .
da shus take the smoking end of the first cigar and press it against the table so that it stand on the shore of the panama canal that he would draw on the table .
he flatten the end of the other cigar and erect it on the other shore of the canal .
" we set up two pillar on the shore of the canal , and then between they we string many parallel , thin filament , about half a meter apart .
the filament should be make from the nanomaterial call ' flying blade , ' develop by professor wang .
a very appropriate name , in this case . "
after shi qiang finish speaking , he stand and wait a few seconds .
then he raise he hand , say to the stunned crowd , " that be it , " turn , and leave .
the air seem frozen .
everyone present stay still like stone statue .
even the drone from the computer all around they seem more careful .
after a long while , someone timidly break the silence , " professor wang , be ' flying blade ' really in the form of filament ? "
wang nod .
" give we current molecular construction technique , the only form we can make be a filament .
the thickness be about one-hundredth the thickness of human hair ....
officer shi get this information from i before the meeting . "
" do you have enough material ? "
" how wide be the canal ?
and how tall be the ship ? "
" the narrowest point of the canal be one hundred fifty meter wide .
judgment day be thirty-one meter tall , with a draft of eight meter or so . "
wang stare at the cigar on the table and do some mental calculation .
" i think i should have enough . "
another long silence .
everyone be try to recover from they astonishment .
" what if the equipment store trisolaran datum , such as hard drive and optical disk , be also slice ? "
" that do not seem likely . "
" even if they be slice , " a computer expert say , " it be not a big deal .
the filament be extremely sharp , and the cut surface would be very smooth .
give that premise , whether it be hard drive , optical disk , or integrate circuit storage , we could recover the vast majority of the datum . "
" anyone get a better idea ? "
chang look around the table .
no one speak .
" all right .
then let 's focus on this and work out the detail . "
colonel stanton , who have be silent the whole time , stand up .
" i will go and ask officer shi to come back . "
general chang indicate that he should remain seat .
then he call out , " da shus ! "
da shus return , grin at everyone .
he pick up the cigar on the table .
the one that have be light he put into he mouth , and the other he stuff into he pocket .
someone ask , " when judgment day pass , can those two pillar bear the force apply against the flying blade filament ?
maybe the pillar would be slice apart first . "
wang say , " that be easy to solve .
we have some small amount of flying blade material that be flat sheet .
we can use they to protect the part of the column where the filament be attach . "
the discussion after that be mainly between the naval officer and navigation expert .
" judgment day be at the upper limit in term of tonnage that can pass through the panama canal .
it have a deep draft , so we have to consider install filament below the waterline . "
" that will be very difficult .
if there be not enough time , i do not think we should worry about it .
the part of the ship below the waterline be use for engine , fuel , and ballast , cause a lot of noise , vibration , and interference .
the condition be too poor for computing center and other similar facility to be located there .
but for the part above water , a tighter nanofilament net will give better result . "
" then it be best to set the trap at one of the lock along the canal .
judgment day be build to panamax specification , just enough to fill the thirty-two-meter lock .
then we would only need to make the flying blade filament thirty-two meter long .
this will also make it easier to erect the pillar and string the filament between they , especially for the underwater part . "
" no. .
the situation around the lock be too unpredictable .
also , a ship inside the lock must be pull forward by four ' mule , ' electric locomotive on rail .
they move slowly , and the time inside the lock will also be when the crew be most alert .
a attempt to slice through the ship during that time would most likely be discover . "
" what about the bridge of the americas , right outside the miraflores locks ?
the abutment at the two end of the bridge can serve as the pillar for string the filament . "
" no. .
the distance between the abutment be too great .
we do not have enough flying blade material . "
" then it be decide : the site of operation should be the narrowest point of the gaillard cut , a hundred and fifty meter across .
add in some slack for the pillar ... let 's call it a hundred seventy meter . "
wang say , " if that be the plan , then the smallest distance between the filament will be fifty centimeter .
i do not have enough material for a tighter net . "
" in other word , we have to make sure the ship cross during the day , " da shus say , blow out another mouthful of smoke .
" why ? "
" at night the crew will be sleep , which mean they 'll all be lie down .
fifty centimeter between filament leave too much of a gap .
but during the day , even if they be sit or crouch , the distance be sufficient . "
a few scattered laugh .
the attendee , all under heavy stress , feel a bit of release tinge with the smell of blood .
" you be truly a demon , " a female un official say to da shus .
" will innocent bystander be hurt ? "
wang ask , he voice tremble .
a naval officer reply , " when the ship go through the lock , more than a dozen cable worker will come onboard , but they 'll all get off after the ship pass .
the panama canal pilot will have to accompany the ship the entire eighty-two kilometer , so the pilot will have to be sacrifice . "
a cia officer say , " and some of the crew aboard judgment day probably do not know the real purpose of the ship . "
" professor , " general chang say , " do not concern yourself with these thought .
the information we need to obtain have to do with the very survival of human civilization .
someone else will make the call . "
as the meeting end , colonel stanton push the beautiful cigar box in front of shi qiang .
" captain , the best havana have to offer .
they be yours . "
four day later , gaillard cut , panama canal
wang could not even tell that he be in a foreign country .
he know that to the west , not too far away , be beautiful gatun lake .
to the east be the magnificent bridge of the americas and panama city .
but he have have no chance to see either of they .
two day earlier , he have arrive by direct flight from china to tocumen international airport near panama city and then ride a helicopter here .
the sight before he be very common : the construction work under way to widen the canal cause the tropical forest on both slope to be quite sparse , reveal large patch of yellow earth .
the color feel familiar to wang .
the canal do not seem very special , probably because it be so narrow here , but a hundred thousand people have dig out this part of the canal in the previous century , one hoe at a time .
wang and colonel stanton sit on lounge chair under a awning halfway up the slope .
both wear loose , colorful shirt , with they panama hat toss to the side , look like two tourist .
below , on each shore of the canal , a twenty-four-meter steel pillar lay flat against the ground , parallel to the shore .
fifty ultrastrong nanofilament , each 160 meter long , be string between the pillar .
at the end on the eastern shore , every filament be connect to a length of regular steel wire .
this be to give the filament enough slack so that they could sink to the bottom of the canal , aid by attach weight .
the setup permit other ship safe passage .
luckily , traffic along the canal be not quite as busy as wang have imagine .
on average , only about forty large ship pass through each day .
the operation 's code name be " guzheng , " base on the similarity between the structure and the ancient chinese zither by that name .
the slice net of nanofilament be thus call the " zither . "
a hour earlier , judgment day have enter the gaillard cut from gatun lake .
stanton ask wang whether he have ever be to panama before .
wang say no. .
" i come here in 1989 , " the colonel say .
" because of that war ? "
" yes , that be one of those war that leave i with no impression .
i only remember be in front of the vatican embassy as ' nowhere to run ' by martha and the vandellas play for the holed-up noriega .
that be my idea , by the way . "
in the canal below they , a pure white french cruise ship slowly sail past .
several passenger in colorful clothing stroll leisurely on the green-carpeted deck .
" second observation post reporting : there be no more ship in front of the target . "
stanton 's walkie-talkie squawk .
stanton give the order .
" raise the zither . "
several man wear hard hat appear on both shore , look like maintenance worker .
wang stand up , but the colonel pull he down .
" professor , do not worry .
they know what to do . "
wang watch as those on the eastern shore rapidly winch back the steel wire attach to the nanofilament and secure the tighten nanofilament to the pillar .
then , slowly , the two pillar be stand upright use they mechanical hinge .
as a disguise , the pillar be decorate with some navigational marking and water depth indicator .
the worker proceed leisurely , as though they be simply carry out they boring job .
wang gaze at the space between the pillar .
there seem to be nothing there , but the deadly zither be already in place .
" target be four kilometer from the zither , " the voice in the walkie-talkie say .
stanton put the walkie-talkie down .
he continue the conversation with wang .
" the second time i come to panama be in 1999 , to attend the ceremony for the handover of the canal to panama .
oddly , by the time we get to the authority 's building , the stars and stripes be already go .
supposedly the u.s. government have request that the flag be lower a day early to avoid the embarrassment of lower the flag in front of a crowd ....
back then , i think i be witness history .
but now that seem so insignificant . "
" target be three kilometer from the zither . "
" yes , insignificant , " wang mumble .
he be not listen to stanton at all .
the rest of the world have cease to exist for he .
all of he attention be focus on the spot where judgment day would appear .
by now the sun that have rise over the atlantic be fall toward the pacific .
the canal sparkle with golden light .
close by , the deadly zither stand quietly .
the two steel pillar be dark and reflect no sunlight , look even older than the canal that flow between they .
" target be two kilometer from the zither . "
stanton seem to not have hear the voice from the walkie-talkie .
he continue , " after learn that the alien fleet be come toward the earth , i have be suffer from amnesia .
it be so strange .
i can not recall many thing from the past .
i do not remember the detail of the war i experience .
like i just say , those war all seem so insignificant .
after learn this truth , everyone become a new person spiritually , and see the world anew .
i have be think : suppose two thousand year ago , or even earlier , humanity learn that a alien invasion fleet would arrive a few thousand year later .
what would human civilization be like now ?
professor , can you imagine it ? "
" ah , no. . . "
wang answer perfunctorily , he mind elsewhere .
" target be one point five kilometer from the zither . "
" professor , i think you will be the gaillard of this new era .
we be wait for you new panama canal to be build .
indeed , the space elevator be a canal .
just as the panama canal connect two ocean , the space elevator will connect space with the earth . "
wang know that the colonel 's babble be mean to help he through this very difficult time .
he be grateful , but it be not work .
" target be one kilometer from the zither . "
judgment day appear .
in the light from the setting sun come over the hill to the side , it be a dark silhouette against the golden wave of the canal .
the sixty-thousand-ton ship be much larger than wang have imagine .
its appearance be like another peak abruptly insert among the hill .
even though wang know that the canal be capable of accommodate ship as large as seventy thousand ton , witness such a large ship in such a narrow waterway be a strange feeling .
give its immensity , the canal below seem to no longer exist .
the ship be a mountain glide across solid earth .
after he grow use to the sunlight , wang see that judgment day 's hull be pitch black , and the superstructure be paint pure white .
the giant antenna be go .
they hear the roar from the ship 's engine , accompany by the churn sound of wave that have be generate by the round prow slapping against the shore of the canal .
as the distance between judgment day and the deadly zither close , wang 's heart begin to beat faster , and he breath become short .
he have a desire to run away , but he feel so weak that he could no longer control he body .
all at once , he be overwhelm by a deep hatred for shi qiang .
how could the bastard have come up with such a idea ?
like that un official say , he be a demon !
but the feeling pass .
he think that if da shus be by he side , he would probably feel better .
colonel stanton have invite shi qiang to come , but general chang refuse to give permission because he say that da shus be need where he be .
wang feel the colonel 's hand on he back .
" professor , all this will pass . "
judgment day be below they now , pass through the deadly zither .
when its prow first contact the plane between the two steel pillar , the space that seem empty , wang 's scalp tighten .
but nothing happen .
the immense hull of the ship continue to slowly sail past the two steel pillar .
when half the ship have pass , wang begin to doubt whether the nanofilament between the steel pillar really exist .
but a small sign soon negate he doubt .
he notice a thin antenna located at the very top of the superstructure break at its base , and the antenna tumble down .
soon , there be a second sign indicate the presence of the nanofilament , a sign that almost make wang break down .
judgment day 's wide deck be empty save for one man standing near the stern hose down the ship 's bollard .
from he vantage point , wang see everything clearly .
the moment that that section of the ship pass between the pillar , the hose break into two piece not too far from the man , and water spill out .
the man 's body stiffen , and the nozzle tumble from he hand .
he remain stand for a few seconds , then fall .
as he body contact the deck , it come apart in two half .
the top half crawl through the expand pool of blood , but have to use two arm that be bloody stump .
the hand have be cleanly slice off .
after the stern of the ship go between the two pillar , judgment day continue to sail forward at the same speed , and everything seem normal .
but then wang hear the sound of the engine shift into a strange whine , before turn into chaotic noise .
it sound like a wrench be throw into the rotor of a large motor â€” no , many , many wrench .
he know this be the result of the rotate part of the engine have be cut .
after a pierce , tear sound , a hole appear in the side of the stern of judgment day , make by a large metallic piece punching through the hull .
a broken component fly out of the hole and fall into the water , cause a large column of water to shoot up .
as it briefly fly past , wang recognize it as a section of the engine crankshaft .
a thick column of smoke pour out of the hole .
judgment day , which have be sail along the right shore , now begin to turn , drag this smoky tail .
soon it cross over the canal and smash into the left shore .
as wang look , the giant prow deform as it collide into the slope , slice open the hill like water , cause wave of earth to spill in all direction .
at the same time , judgment day begin to separate into more than forty slice , each slice half a meter thick .
the slice near the top move faster than the slice near the bottom , and the ship spread open like a deck of card .
as the forty-some metal slice move past each other , the pierce noise be like countless giant fingernail scratch against glass .
by the time the intolerable noise end , judgment day be spill on the shore like a stack of plate carry by a stumbling waiter , the plate near the top have travel the farthest .
the slice look as soft as cloth , and rapidly deform into complicated shape impossible to imagine as have once belong to a ship .
soldier rush toward the shore from the slope .
wang be surprise to find so many man hide nearby .
a fleet of helicopter arrive along the canal with they engine roar ; cross the canal surface , which be now cover by a iridescent oil slick ; hover over the wreckage of judgment day ; and begin to drop large quantity of fire suppression foam and powder .
shortly , the fire in the wreckage be under control , and three other helicopter begin to drop searcher into the wreckage with cable .
colonel stanton have already leave .
wang pick up the binoculars he would leave on top of he hat .
overcome he tremble hand , he observe judgment day .
by this time , the wreckage be mostly cover by fire-extinguishing foam and powder , but the edge of some of the slice be leave expose .
wang see the cut surface , smooth as mirror .
they reflect the fiery red light of dusk perfectly .
he also see a deep red spot on the mirror surface .
he be not sure if it be blood .
three day later
interrogator : do you understand trisolaran civilization ?
ye wenjie : no. .
we receive only very limited information .
no one have real , detailed knowledge of trisolaran civilization except mike evans and other core member of the adventists who intercept they message .
interrogator : then why do you have such hope for it , think that it can reform and perfect human society ?
ye : if they can cross the distance between the star to come to we world , they science must have develop to a very advanced stage .
a society with such advanced science must also have more advanced moral standard .
interrogator : do you think this conclusion you draw be scientific ?
ye : ...
interrogator : let i presume to guess : you father be deeply influence by you grandfather 's belief that only science could save china .
and you be deeply influence by you father .
ye : ( sigh quietly ) i do not know .
interrogator : we have already obtain all the trisolaran message intercept by the adventists .
ye : oh ... what happen to evans ?
interrogator : he die during the operation to capture judgment day .
but the posture of he body point we to the computer hold copy of the trisolaran message .
thankfully , they be all encode with the same self-interpreting code use by red coast .
ye : be there a lot of datum ?
interrogator : yes , about twenty-eight gigabyte .
ye : that be impossible .
interstellar communication be very inefficient .
how can so much datum have be transmit ?
interrogator : we think so at first , too .
but thing be not at all as we have imagine â€” not even in we boldest , most fantastic imagination .
how about this ?
please read this section of the preliminary analysis of the capture datum , and you can see the reality of the trisolaran civilization , compare with you beautiful fantasy .
