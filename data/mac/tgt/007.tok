trinket accompany big beaver , brother li , and the other leader to the main gate .
outside they find the member of the lodge already wait , between two and three hundred of they , spread out in v-shaped formation on either side of the gate , all with eager , expectant look on they face .
after a while the same two big fellow come out carry whisker between they in he hammock .
' mao , old fellow , ' say brother li , ' you do not need to wait out here with we .
you be we guest . '
' just hear about the helmsman have always be a inspiration to i , ' say whiskers .
' now that there be a chance to actually see he , i would not miss it for the world . '
because of he extreme weakness he voice be still faint , but there be a flush of excitement on he pallid cheek .
presently the sound of gallop grow nearer and a party of some ten or so horseman could be see approach in a little cloud of dust .
the three foremost of they jump lightly from they horse while they be still at some distance from the gate .
brother li and the other leader go forward to meet they and there be much exchange of handclasp and friendly greeting .
trinket overhear one of the horseman say that the helmsman be wait somewhere ' ahead ' and want brother li , big beaver , and one or two other senior to come and see he .
after stand there some minute in discussion , six lead member of the lodge — brother li , big beaver , tertius , father obscurus , and two other whom trinket do not know by name — get on to wait horse and gallop off with the other rider .
' be not the helmsman come here then ? ' ask whiskers , dreadfully disappointed .
none of those wait have the heart to answer he , since they be all feeling equally disappointed .
' what be the matter with you all ? ' think trinket .
' anyone would think someone have borrow ten thousand tael off you and would not pay it back , or you would lose you wife 's trousers gamble or something .
what a miserable-looking lot ! '
after a good while longer , another horseman arrive and read out the name of thirteen lodge-member who be to go for interview with the helmsman .
the thirteen man , with rapturous expression on they face , dash to the ready-waiting horse , jump into the saddle , and gallop away .
' whiskers , ' trinket ask he stricken friend , ' be this helmsman a very old man ? '
' i. . . i have never meet he , ' say whiskers .
' on river and lake there be no one who do not look up to he , but i do know that to actually get to meet he be very , very difficult . '
' tamardy ! ' think trinket .
' what a big-head !
well , you do not impress i , mr big shot helmsman .
it be all the same to i whether i see you or not . '
by this time it be begin to look as if most member of the lodge be definitely not go to get a glimpse of they beloved leader ; nevertheless they continue to stand there outside the gate , nurse a faint hope that he might after all appear .
some of they , tire of standing , sit on the ground .
one of they urge whisker to go indoors and rest .
' if the helmsman do come , ' he tell whisker , ' i promise to let you know straight away . '
but whiskers shake he head .
' no , no , i would rather wait here .
if the helmsman do come and i be not wait here outside , it would be very — well , disrespectful . '
he sigh wistfully .
' i wonder if it will be my luck to see he before i die . '
in he conversation with trinket on the long journey from yangzhou to peking there be hardly a well-known practitioner of the martial arts whom whiskers have not at one time or other disparaged .
chen jinnan , the helmsman , appear to be the only expert in these matter for whom he have unqualified respect .
listen to whisker now , trinket could not help absorb a little of he enthusiasm , to the extent that he now stop think of rude thing to say about this paragon who seem so conscious of he own worth .
suddenly there be a sound of hoofbeat once more and another party of horseman come ride up .
those triads who have be sit on the ground leap to they foot and everyone crane forward , hope that this time the summons would be for he .
there be four messenger this time .
they leader , have dismount from he horse , clasp he hand together respectfully : ' the helmsman request mr mao and mr wei to favour he with they company . '
whisker leap up with a joyful cry , then almost immediately sink back into the hammock with a groan .
' let 's go ! ' he say to he bearer .
' hurry ! '
trinket , for he part , be extremely tickled to be call ' mr wei ' .
even he surname — he mother 's actually , since he paternity be unknown — be seldom use ; but never in he life before have anyone call he ' mr ' .
well ! ' he think .
' i have hear plenty of " goong-goong " recently ; but not " mr " .
ha ha !
now i be " mr trinket wei " . '
two of the mount man take charge of whisker , support the end of the carrying-pole from which he hammock be suspend on they saddle-bow and ride along in parallel very slowly and carefully .
another of they give up he horse to trinket and find himself another horse on which he ride along behind .
the little party of six walk they horse along the road for about a mile before take a right-hand turn into a little side-road .
along this , every few hundred yard , be little knot of two or three man , some sit , some walk to and fro , all evidently lookout , since the lead horseman , on see they , would make a sign , stretch out the last three finger of he right hand and point with they downwards , whereupon the man would nod and silently answer he with some mysterious signal of they own .
trinket observe that the signal they make be all different , but be unable to guess they significance .
after they have be ride along this side-road for about four mile , they come to a large farmhouse or grange .
as they arrive at the entrance , a guard on the door shout to the people inside , ' the guest have arrive , ' whereupon the door open and out come brother li , big beaver , and two other man whom trinket have not see before .
one of these last clasped he hand politely and welcome they in : ' mr mao , mr wei , welcome !
we society 's helmsman look forward to meeting you . '
trinket be thrill .
the ' mr ' seem to be stick .
whisker struggle to get up .
' i can not see the helmsman like this .
it be too . . . it be too . . . ' but the effort to raise himself once more end in a groan .
' you be a wounded man , ' say brother li .
' you do not need to stand on ceremony . '
he usher trinket and whiskers ' bearer into the main reception room .
a man offer trinket some tea and ask he to wait there a while as the helmsman want to speak to mr mao first .
whisker be carry through a inner door for he interview .
while trinket be drink he cup of tea , a servant come in with four plate on which be various cake and dimsum .
he reaction on sampling these be unfavourable .
' these be not a patch on the one they do in the palace , ' he think .
they be not even as good as the one they use to serve in the brothel . '
he estimation of the helmsman at once go down a couple of notch .
however , he be feel empty , and in quite a short time have make considerable inroad into the eatables on all four of the plate .
after about the time it would take to consume a average meal , brother li and the other three come in again , and one of the two trinket do not know by name , a old man with a grizzled beard , tell he that the helmsman be now ready to see he .
at some risk of choke , he swallow the large mouthful he have be chew , brush off the crumb with he hand , and follow the four man into one of the wing of the building which , together with the main reception room , enclose a large courtyard on three side .
there , stop outside a doorway , the old man with the grizzled beard lift up the door-curtain and announce they .
' mr trinket wei , the little white dragon to see you . '
trinket be surprised and a little flattered that they should somehow have get hold of he made-up nom de guerre .
this must be whisker ' do , he conclude .
a man in he thirty dress in the costume of a scholar rise to he foot as they enter , smile a welcome .
trinket walk in and stand for a moment dart question glance around he .
' this be the helmsman , ' say big beaver .
trinket steal a glance at the scholar .
he have a mild and gentle face , but there be a force in he flash eye which seem to bear right through he and make he gasp .
almost unconsciously he sink to he knee and begin to kowtow ; but the scholar bent down to stop he .
' no , no , that be not necessary , ' he say with a laugh .
trinket could feel the scholar 's strong hand on he arm .
a warm sensation pass through he body , follow by a little tremor of excitement .
he abandon he kowtow and get up .
' by arrest and kill oboi , the manchu champion , ' say the scholar , speak to the four older man but keep he eye on trinket , ' we young hero here have avenge the death of countless number of we fellow-countryman .
in the course of a few day he name have become a household word .
to have win such fame , and so early in life too , be a almost unparalleled achievement . '
although trinket have enough cheek to shame the devil and would normally , if anyone else have praise he like this , have treat it as a excuse to show off , he find himself , in the presence of this helmsman with he gentleness and he air of quiet authority , completely tongue-tied .
' sit down ! '
the helmsman point to a chair and sit down himself .
trinket follow he example but notice that the four older man remain standing , they arm hold respectfully at they side .
' i gather that you career as a strategist begin very early , ' say the helmsman , smile .
' mr mao tell i that already , near victory hill , when you be still not far from yangzhou , you kill a manchu officer by means of a ruse .
i still have not hear how you manage to arrest oboi though . '
lift he head slightly , trinket catch a glimpse of those dazzling eye and feel he heart beat faster .
all desire to indulge in he customary trumpet-blowing drain from he on the instant and he find himself for once give a completely honest account of what he have do .
he tell the helmsman how he have become kang xi 's favourite ; how oboi have threaten and insult the young emperor ; and how he and the emperor have join force to take oboi prisoner .
out of a sense of loyalty to kang xi , he say nothing about kang xi stab oboi in the back ; but he make no attempt to conceal the fact that he have blind obous with incense-ash and then hit he on the head with a bronze brazier , although he be fully aware that to a man of honour like the helmsman this would seem , if not a third-rate , certainly a pretty second-rate way of overcome a enemy .
the helmsman listen to all that trinket have to say without make a single interruption .
when at last trinket have finish , he nod .
' i see .
well , clearly you do not learn you technique from mr mao .
who be you teacher ? '
' i have have a little training , ' say trinket , ' but i do not have a proper teacher .
what the old devil teach i be not real martial art , it be just rubbish . '
' the old devil ? '
the helmsman 's vast knowledge do not encompass any practitioner with that nom de guerre .
trinket burst out laughing .
' old devil be what i use to call the old eunuch hai-goong — among other thing .
he real name be hai dafu .
he be the one who capture i and mao eighteen and bring we into the palace . . . '
he suddenly realize that this flatly contradict what he have say previously .
he have tell the triad member that he and mao eighteen have be capture and take into the palace by oboi .
to a practised liar like trinket , however , this present little difficulty .
the old eunuch be act on oboi 's order .
i suppose oboi , be so important , be too grand to do the dirty work himself . '
but the helmsman appear to be deep in thought .
' hai dafu ?
hai dafu ?
be there a eunuch with that name in the tartar palace ? '
he turn to trinket .
' show i a few of the thing he teach you , little brother , ' he say .
however immune to self-criticism trinket might be , he know that what he like to call he martial arts training be really a joke .
' the old devil only pretend to teach i , ' he say .
' he hate i because i make he blind , so he do everything in he power to harm i .
the sort of thing he teach i be not the sort of thing you would want anyone else to see . '
the helmsman nod and make a little gesture with he left hand .
at once big beaver and the other three older man leave the room , close the door after they as they go .
' now , ' say the helmsman , ' what do you mean when you say you make the old eunuch go blind ? '
in the presence of this heroic individual trinket find it harder to tell he habitual lie than to tell the truth — a sensation he have never experience before .
he now find himself tell the helmsman how the massive dose of medicine he have put in the old eunuch 's cup have cause he to go blind and how he have kill the little eunuch laurie and take he place .
the helmsman , have hear this last piece of information with amusement and some surprise , feel with he left hand between trinket 's leg and satisfied himself that he be indeed equip with those part which eunuch lack but ordinary little boy possess .
then he give what to trinket sound very much like a sigh of relief .
' good , ' he say with a little smile .
' if you have not be mutilate and you be not a eunuch , this suggest a way out of a difficulty that have be bother i for some time . '
he tap the table lightly with he left hand and continue speaking , apparently to himself .
' yes , of course .
this be obviously the solution .
it give brother yin a successor and the green wood lodge a master . '
trinket do not understand what he be talk about , but he could tell from he pleased expression that some great weight have be lift from he mind and could not help feeling pleased on he behalf .
the helmsman walk to and fro in the room , he hand clasp behind he , mutter to himself .
' everything this society have ever do have be unprecedented .
all innovation lie ultimately in the hand of the individual .
we must be bold enough to ignore the censure of the vulgar and the loud outcry of those to whom every novelty be shocking . '
to trinket this book-language of the helmsman 's be even more incomprehensible than what he have say before .
' look , ' say the helmsman to trinket , ' there be only two of we here now , so you have no need to feel embarrassed .
never mind whether what hai dafu teach you be the real thing or not ; just give i a demonstration of what it be . '
trinket now realize that it be to spare he the embarrassment of make a fool of himself in front of the other that he have send they out of the room .
there seem to be nothing for it but to comply .
' well , it be what the old devil teach i , ' he say , ' so it be not my fault how bad it be .
if it look really ridiculous , you must put the blame on he . '
the helmsman give he little smile .
' do not worry about that ; just get on with it . '
so trinket strike up a attitude and begin to go through the motion of the merciful guanyin repertoire — the rather limited part of it , that be , that the old eunuch have teach he .
he have already forget some bit of it , but could remember enough to put on some sort of performance .
the helmsman watch he with fix attention and nod when he have finish .
' from what you have just be do , ' he say , ' it look as though you may have be teach a little bit of the shaolin school of catch-can .
be i right ? '
the greater catch-can be what trinket have learn first , before he even start on the merciful guanyin method of self-defence .
he know he must be even worse at catch-can than at the merciful guanyin stuff and have be hope to conceal he inadequacy by keep quiet about it ; but there be no conceal anything from the helmsman , who appear to know everything : there be nothing for it but to go on make a fool of himself .
' yes , ' he say .
' the old devil teach i a bit of catch-can to use in my wrestling-bout with the emperor . '
and he proceed to demonstrate as much as he could remember of the greater catch-can .
once again the helmsman give he little smile .
' not bad ! '
' i know all along it would only make you laugh , ' say trinket .
' i be not laugh at you , ' say the helmsman .
' i be smile because i be please to see that you memory and comprehension be so good .
that white pony kick you could not quite bring off i think hai dafu must have deliberately teach you incorrectly ; but instead of let it fluster you , you use you own imagination and initiative to develop it into a carp-fin flick .
i think that be very good . '
trinket guess that the helmsman be a far greater master of the martial art than the old devil have be and the thought suddenly strike he how wonderful it would be if the helmsman be willing to take he on as a disciple , to be he teacher , he shifu .
then , surely , he could become a real hero , not the fake one he be at present .
he glance shyly in the helmsman 's direction and find that cold , electric gaze direct at he .
trinket be a shameless young blackguard and could look even the formidable empress dowager in the eye without blenching ; but the helmsman be somehow different .
in the helmsman 's presence he have become suddenly terrify of misbehaving and as soon as they eye meet have quickly to avert he own .
' do you know what the triad society be for ? ' the helmsman ask he , speak very slowly and deliberately .
' the triad society want to drive out the qing and restore the ming , ' say trinket .
' it be for help the chinese and kill tartars . '
the helmsman nod .
' exactly .
would you like to join the triad society and become a brother ? '
that would be terrific , ' say trinket delightedly .
in he mind every member of the triad society be a hero .
it have not occur to he that he might ever become one himself .
but then he reflect that whisker be not a member , and it be absurd to imagine that he could be better-qualified than whisker ; so he say , ' i be afraid . . . i be afraid i be not good enough . '
he eye , which for a moment have be shine , be now full of disappointment .
it be too much to hope that the helmsman 's offer have be serious .
he must have be joke .
' if you want to be a member you can , ' say the helmsman , ' only you must remember that this be a very important business we be engage in .
we have to put we country first , even before we life .
then again , the rule be very strict and the penalty for break they very heavy .
you need to think carefully before you decide . '
' i do not need to think , ' say trinket .
' whatever you rule be , i 'll keep they .
if you 'll let i join , helmsman , i 'll be the happiest boy in the world . '
the helmsman 's smile give way to a more grave expression .
' this be a extremely serious business , involve matter of life and death .
we be not talk about child 's game . '
' i know that , ' say trinket .
' i have hear lot about the triad society .
it fight for honour and justice .
it do all sort of amazing thing .
of course it be not a child 's game . '
the helmsman smile .
' well , as long as you know .
there be thirty-six rule that everyone join the society must swear to follow .
the rule include ten absolute prohibition , each with a very severe punishment lay down for anyone who break it . '
he face become grave again .
' some of the rule do not apply in you case yet , because you be too young ; but there be one of they against dishonesty .
it say , " every brother must be honest in all he dealings .
he must not lie or cheat . "
do you think you be capable of keep that rule ? '
trinket be slightly take aback .
' i would never tell you a lie , helmsman , ' he say , ' but with the other brother , would i have to tell they the truth — all the time ? '
' perhaps not in minor matter , ' say the helmsman , ' but in important one , yes . '
' well that be all right , ' say trinket .
' what about gamble ?
if i be gamble with other member of the society , be i allow to cheat a bit ? '
the helmsman be unprepared for a question of this nature .
' gambling be not a good thing , ' he say with the faintest of smile , ' but there be nothing in the rule which forbid it .
of course , if you cheat they and they find out , they would probably beat you up , and there be no rule against that either : so you would probably be well advise not to try . '
they would not find out , ' say trinket , grin .
' actually , though , i do not need to cheat .
when i gamble , nine time out of ten i win anyway . '
since most member of the society come from a travel background in which gambling and drunken brawling be accept as normal behaviour , the helmsman be incline to turn a blind eye on these matter .
he look at trinket intently for some moment as if try to make he mind up about something .
' would you like to be my apprentice ? '
what happiness !
trinket fall at once to he knee and begin kowtow .
' shifu ! '
this time the helmsman make no effort to raise he up , but let he knock he head a dozen or more time on the floor before he stop he .
' all right , that be enough . '
trinket get up again , smile delightedly .
' now that i have become you shifu , you have better know my real name , ' say the helmsman , ' but you be not to tell anyone .
my surname be chen .
i expect you know that already .
but chen jinnan be only the name i be know by on river and lake .
it be not my real name .
my real name be chen yonghua . '
' i 'll remember that , ' say trinket .
' and i promise not to tell anyone . '
the helmsman contemplate he new disciple for some moment in silence .
' now that we be shifu and apprentice , ' he say gravely ' we have to be completely open with each other .
i do not mind tell you that i find you both glib-tongued and sly .
you nature be a very different one from my own , and i must admit that i be not at all happy about this .
in take you on as my apprentice , it be more the interest of the society than anything else that i have in mind . '
' from now on i 'll do my best to change , ' say trinket .
' it be easier for the earth to leave its mooring than for a man to change he nature , ' say the helmsman .
' you will not be able to change very much .
on the other hand you be still young and comparatively unformed ; and so far you do not seem to have do anything particularly bad .
in future you 'll just have to keep remind yourself all the time to do as i tell you .
i believe in be very strict with my apprentice , so if i find that you have be break the society 's rule or plot mischief or do anything really bad , i shall kill you without mercy .
and remember : i can kill you any time , as easily as break a egg . '
as if to demonstrate , he tap the table with he left hand and then seize the corner of it in he grasp .
there be a crunch sound as it break off .
then he take the broken-off piece between he palm and rub it until it fall in a shower of tiny sliver on the floor .
trinket stick he tongue out in amazement and it be some time before he could put it back in again .
yet he overriding feeling be not of amazement but of happiness that he have get this heroic strong man for he teacher .
' i promise you i will not ever do anything bad , ' he say .
' i would not want my shifu to crunch my head up !
and besides , if i do do a few bad thing , and you do crunch i up , with i go , who have there be to pass on you secret ! '
' not " a few bad thing " ! ' say the helmsman .
' one !
just one bad thing , and i shall no longer consider you my apprentice . '
' what about two bad thing ? ' say trinket .
the helmsman 's face look stern .
' you be be flippant .
when i say one bad thing i mean one .
do you think this be something you can haggle about ? '
' no , sir , ' say trinket ; but a rebellious little voice inside he be say , ' what about half a bad thing ? '
' you be my fourth apprentice , ' say the helmsman , ' and probably you will be my last .
the triad society keep i so busy that i do not have much time for apprentice .
of you three brother-apprentice , two die fight against the tartars and the third be kill in marshal zheng 's campaign to retake taiwan .
all three be brave young man who give they life for they country .
apart from that i have my own reputation to keep up and i do not want you disgrace i . '
' no , sir , ' say trinket .
' but . . . but — '
' but what ? ' say the helmsman .
' sometimes thing that might disgrace you seem to happen to i when i can not help it , ' say trinket .
' like be capture by someone bigger and stronger than i and shut up in a barrel of date and push around like goods to market .
you must not blame i for thing like that . '
the helmsman find he do not quite know whether to be angry or amuse .
finally he give a sigh .
' i be begin to think that take you on as my apprentice may prove to be the biggest mistake of my life .
there be so much that hang on this though , i just have to take the chance .
now listen , trinket .
there be go to be some important business presently .
just keep quiet , do everything i tell you , and do not talk a lot of nonsense , and you 'll be all right .
be that understand ? '
' yes , sir , ' say trinket .
observe that trinket appear to be hesitate , the helmsman ask he if there be something else he want to say .
' it be only that what i say always do seem sensible to i , ' say trinket .
' i never mean to talk nonsense .
so when you tell i i be talk nonsense , it seem unfair . '
' in that case the best thing be not to talk at all , ' say the helmsman .
but what he think be , ' how many man of valour and reputation have i see behave like submissive flunkey and hardly daring to breathe in my presence , yet this two-faced , shifty little urchin can stand here and give i all this lip ! '
he get up and stride towards the door .
' come on , ' he say .
' follow i . '
trinket rush to open it for he and hold up the door-curtain for he to go through .
then he follow he to the hall .
