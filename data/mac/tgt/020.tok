old colour
" lao ke-la " refer to a specific breed of debonair figure active during the fifty and sixty .
these be the keeper of old-style shanghai fashion in the new society , at a time when hold on to the past be consider radical .
the term probably originate with the english word " old colour , " or perhaps " old classic , " a remnant of the colonial culture of shanghai in the day of the treaty port .
as the lingo of the city incorporate bit and piece of foreign language , word become dismembered and , with the passage of time , grow increasingly distant from they original meaning .
by the eighty , people who fall into the category of " old colour " be virtually extinct .
the survive handful be all fairly advance in age , they erstwhile shape completely transform ; eventually even the term itself be forget .
but then something odd happen .
in the mid eighty , a new generation of old colours emerge quietly upon the scene .
lack they predecessor ' craving for notoriety , they be not compel to behave ostentatiously and appear more easygoing .
it be not even easy to spot they in the crowd .
where might one go to find such a specimen ?
these old colours — when everyone be out buy a stereo , they be listen to old phonograph .
when nikon and minolta camera equip with auto-focus feature be all the rage , they be busy fiddle with they vintage rolleiflex 120s .
they sport wind-up watch , drink coffee brew in small pot , shave with old-fashioned razor blade and shave cream , take great delight in antique slide projector , and wear large leather shoe shape like boat .
when you see these marking , you could be certain that you have find one .
then , have find one , you could not help but notice just how crude and boorish the so-called fashionable be in comparison .
the rush to be trendy leave no time for elegance or refinement .
one be drive about by a succession of wave .
speed and quantity be all that matter , and the result be that corner be cut and thing get do in a slipshod manner and have eventually to be discard .
you could tell this by look at the clothing shop where advertisement for markdown be post all over the wall , shelf , and counter — even the stall outside .
before the last season 's clothes have sell out , they be two step behind the latest fashion , which have already arrive .
what choice be there but to run constant sale and markdown ?
in this crude and uncultured fashion world , the " old colours " be the steward in charge of safekeep refinement .
they be the only one pay attention to the thing that matter ; though they never advertise themselves or talk about what they be do , they have they foot firmly plant on the ground .
they take thing one step at a time ; man of action , they let other do the talking .
they do not even have a name .
the term " old colour " be give to they by the few who remember the old day , but it never gain wide circulation .
a small minority call they western-style " yuppie , " but that never catch on either .
and so they remain nameless , silently till they little plot of land .
we could , if we choose , refer to they as nostalgic " lover of the past , " although they be all young and do not have a past to love per se .
but they have all be to the bund and see , ride on the ferry , what it look like from out on the water : there they see the rampart form by the georgian building , the gothic bell tower with its pointed steeple , and the dark forbid window stare back at they — all of which send they down the tunnel of time .
they have also climb up to the rooftop to release pigeon and fly kite , and there , look out over the sea of rooftop , a few of which jut out like sail , feel as if they be navigate against the current of time .
besides these , the ivy crawl up the side of the wall and the sound of someone play the piano in the western-style house next door also come to feed they nostalgia .
wang qiyao know one of these " old colours . "
he be twenty-six year old , so call he a " old colour " be a bit ironic , a way of emphasize he youth .
a gym teacher at a local middle school , he normally dress in sweatpant , and he hair look like the bristle end of a scrub brush .
he have a dark complexion from year of work outdoors .
at school he keep to himself and never fraternize with he colleague .
who would have guess that he be a accomplished flamenco guitar player with a collection of more than a hundred jazz record ?
this " old colour " live in a traditional longtang in hongkou , with parent who be honest , hardworking government employee and watch what they spend ; he sister have leave home to get marry .
he himself occupy the third-floor tingzijian : he palmwood cot lay on the floor along with he record player .
as soon as he enter he room , he would take off he shoe and , sit on the bare floor , enter into he own little universe .
outside he dormer window be a slant portion of the roof .
occasionally , during the summer , he would climb out the window with a backpack , spread a mat out over the roof tile , and , tie himself to the windowsill with a rope around he waist , spend the evening lie outside .
look up , he would see a sprinkling of star suspend in the deep blue sky above .
he could faintly make out the rumble sound of the machinery from a factory in the distance , and the smoke from the factory 's smokestack billow white against the sky .
the scatter sound of the night seem to have sink down to earth , while he himself have dissolve into the air , empty of thought and desire .
old colour be still without a girlfriend .
although he get on quite well with some of the girl in he regular circle of friend , thing have never develop past the point of ordinary friendship .
as there be nothing further he need , he have no particular aspiration and be content just to have a job .
however , he recognize that he have only himself to rely on , and this make he approach thing with a positive attitude .
and , though he lack long-term goal , he do have some short-term plan .
this mean that , while never vex by major problem , he be strike by the occasional fit of inexplicable depression .
for these depression he find a antidote in he collection of old jazz record from the twenty .
the sound of the saxophone , mix with the hissing sound of the needle against the vinyl , give he a feeling of a almost palpable intimacy .
old colour be a bit old-fashioned : nothing new suit he taste , because to he it lack substance and smack of the nouveau riche ; but then neither be he a fan of thing that be too old , which would have feel antiquated and dismal .
a hundred year be just about enough .
he long for a time back when , like the sprinkling of star in the night sky , only the elite prosper — for a european-style house on a smooth cobblestone road , and the spiral sound of the phonograph twist they way up through a otherwise perfect silence .
this be , when all be say and do , what all those old jazz record stand for .
he young friend be all modern individual at the cut edge of fashion , quite the opposite of old colour .
when shanghai inaugurate its first tennis court , he friend be the first customer stand in line ; when a certain luxury hotel open up a bowling alley , they be the first to try it out .
all of they be college classmate of old colour from the phys-ed department ; they pride themselves on they athletic spirit and prowess , which happen to be right in tune with worldwide fashion .
just look at the most popular brand name of the day — nike and puma — you could see that they be all athletic apparel , whereas brand like pierre cardin have long be on the way down .
this cohort would appear on the street on motorcycle , a girl seat at the back with she hair streaming down from she helmet , and you could feel the rush of wind as they fly past .
they be the wildest one on the dance floor at the disco .
they always manage to get hold of a foreigner or two to give they gathering a international flavor — which , incidentally , gain they entry into all kind of exclusive place where only international guest be welcome .
among they , old colour be always the quiet one : he never really contribute to the group .
when everyone else be have a great time , he would be off stand in one corner as if he do not count .
he seem a bit lonely , but it be precisely such loneliness that provide this fashionable , happy-go-lucky crowd with a certain substance .
so it actually would not have be the same if he have not be there .
as for himself , he need a modern backdrop to set himself off from everyone else ; have he be throw into the sea of people unattached , he old-fashioned style would have be completely drown out .
because he style appear outdate on the surface , people have a hard time identify it for what it be ; but it really stand out against a super-modern background , like a antique place on a velvet mat .
without the mat , someone would probably have throw the piece away , think it be junk .
therefore old colour have to run with that crowd , lonely as he may have be .
if he have leave , he would have lose even the distinction of be lonely — he would have simply disappear among the teem mass .
old colour 's parent always think of he as a responsible son ; he do not drink or smoke , have a steady job and a healthy hobby , and never get mix up with the wrong sort of girl .
they themselves have be fairly conservative in they youth ; go to the movie once a week be they sole entertainment .
there be a period when he mother become obsess with collect movie pamphlet , but during the cultural revolution she take it upon herself to burn she entire collection ; later the movie theater stop put they out .
once he parent buy a television set , they stop go to the movie altogether .
every night they would turn on the television after dinner and watch until eleven o'clock .
with this television set , they golden year seem perfect .
the music they son play up in the tingzijian have a familiar sound , which tend to confirm they opinion that he be steady .
the fact that he be taciturn also put they at ease .
even when they have dinner together at the same table , the entire meal would pass with barely a few word .
when it come down to it , they be all stranger to each other , but see each other , day in , day out , they do not think much about they state , as if this be how it be suppose to be .
but they be , in truth , decent people ; they thought and action be always in line and , whether it be spiritual or material , just a little bit of space be enough for they .
cram in under the rooftop of the shanghai longtang be countless people live out they frugal life just like that .
on occasion you might feel that it be rather noisy — as soon as the window be open , you ear would be assault by all kind of sound .
but do not be offend : what you hear be the accumulate sound of the activity of prudent people over they lifetime ; at least the noise show that they be lively .
and old colour certainly be not the only one stargaze from the rooftop on those summer night ; the heart of all these people be restless and unsure of where to go — and so up they go to the rooftop .
there everything be wide open ; even the know pigeon be bed down for the evening , leave the sky empty of they flight .
all the noise and clatter remain below , but they have float to the top and it feel good to drift for a while .
in these longtang with the dormer window , the song of the heart have quite a distinctive sound , and the dormer window be the throat through which the song be force out .
old colour find true understanding in the neighborhood on the west side of shanghai , and he like to wander there along the tree-lined street .
even the canopy of the tree there have a history , have filter out the sunlight for a century .
maom road pass from a roar hubbub on one end to quietude on the other , both of which have the vintage of year .
old colour love traverse this area , where he have the feeling that time have be turn back .
examine the trolley track on the street , he try to imagine what it be like when the car be still run ; he could picture two row of wooden bench face each other inside the trolley , just like the one he have see in old silent film .
there seem to be write on the brick and stonework of the old hotel ; as he patiently read they , the word recount trial and tribulation from the past .
the area on the east side of the city also understand old colour .
every major street there lead to the river .
though the scene be less refine , it have a sharpness about it .
the silent film be play here be more like a sweeping epic , the action come on like a hurricane .
time have stop for the seagull soar across the sky , as it have for the pigeon .
that be what he , too , want — for time to stop .
that be not too much to ask , be it ?
he do not ask for a eternity , only the last fifty year .
he request be restrain , like the sunrise in the city , which do not come up over the sea or the horizon , but from the rooftop — its beginning and the end curtail .
in fact , the city be still a child and do not have many day to look back upon .
but a child like old colour be already a old man , who , bypass experience , go straight to reminiscence .
all of he deepest thought be dialogue with the past .
at least the clock in the customs house be still ring , in a world where everything else seem to have vanish like cloud and mist , and the sound he hear be the very sound hear decade ago .
as old colour walk down the street , the wind blow against he face be a draft squeeze through the space between two building .
he may have look calm on the surface , but he heart be vibrant , almost dance with joy .
he love the sunset over shanghai ; the street at dusk be like a fade oil painting , a perfect match for the mood of the city .
one day a friend of he tell old colour about a party someone be have .
all kind of people be suppose to be come , include a former miss shanghai from the old day .
he hop onto the back of he friend 's motorcycle , and they head west to the new residential area near the airport .
the man live on the thirteenth floor of a building that he be manage for the owner , a relative of he who be live overseas .
he do not normally live there , but every few day he would invite friend over for a fun-filled afternoon or evening .
gradually , he party start to gain some notoriety : word travel fast , as one guest bring ten friend and each of they bring along other — but he do not mind , everyone be welcome .
as the number start to build up , it be inevitable that some questionable individual would weasel they way in , and sometimes unpleasant thing , such as theft , would happen .
but with so many people , the probability of someone extraordinary show up be also quite high .
occasionally , real celebrity would appear , such as movie star , the first violin from a famous orchestra , and reporter , as well as the child and grandchild of powerful communist and nationalist leader .
this friend 's party be like small political meeting , where old story and the latest gossip be pass around the living room , the whole place abuzz with excitement .
in this new district , all you see when you open the window be a forest of building .
some of the window be light up while other remain dark ; the sky be unobstructed , but this make the star seem more distant .
below , the car speed down the straight broad road look like a chain of pearl .
not far off there would always be a construction site , where the light blaze through the night and the noise of pile-driver , hammer away in rhythm , fill the entire space below the heaven .
the air be choke with particle of chalky cement and the wind be especially strong as it whip between the building .
the light over in the hotel district look a little lonely due to the height of the building around it , but theirs be a resplendent loneliness that pierce the heart with rapture .
this be indeed a brand-new district that greet everything with a open heart , quite unlike the downtown area , whose convoluted feeling be more difficult to grasp .
arrive in the new district , one have the feeling that one have leave the city behind .
the style of the street and building — build at right angle in a logical manner — be so unlike downtown , which seem to have be lay out by squeeze the emotion out from the heart .
under the sky of the new district , the joyful laughter come from the thirteenth floor of this joint-venture construction suddenly dissipate and the music fade away .
but how much do that bit of happiness really matter in this new district ?
play out behind the honeycomb-like window of those tall building be a fresh new form of happiness .
in hotel so new that they have yet to acquire they four or five star , there be buffet , dance , and reception every night , as well as brazen game of passion that offer no excuse as they announce themselves to the world with " do not disturb " sign .
with people of all race and color take part , it feel like a party of universal jubilation .
this be especially so around christmas time : as soon as the christmas carol break out , you be hard press to discern whether you be in china or abroad .
when you first arrive here , the place seem to lack a heart because it be so carefree — but that be because it have not yet have time to build up a reservoir of recollection ; its mind be blank and have not begin to feel the need to call on its memory .
such be the spiritual state of the entire district .
the laughter and gaiety come from the thirteenth floor form but a drop in the ocean .
the only one who seem a bit annoyed be the elevator attendant , as people come rush in and out of the elevator , in couple or crowd , hold wine and flower — mostly stranger , in all shape , size , and color .
more than a dozen group of guest have already arrive by the time old colour get to the party .
the door have be leave half-open and the room be fill with people move about .
no one pay the newcomer much attention as they come in ; the stereo be blare loud music .
a few people sit around watch a television miniseries in the first room , which lead out to the balcony .
the door to the balcony be ajar and the wind be agitate the curtain .
in a corner of this room sit a woman with fair skin , wear light makeup , in a pinkish-purple suit make of raw silk .
she be lean forward slightly toward the television screen with she arm cross .
the curtain brush against she skirt from time to time , but this do not seem to distract she .
only when the screen suddenly light up do she drooping eyelid show , give away she age .
but the stamp of age pass in a flicker instant : she carefully wrap hers up and tuck it away inside she bone .
the year have tiptoe around she , careful not to leave too many trace , but in the end they could not help leave a few .
this be wang qiyao in 1985 .
around this time the opulence of 1946 be revive in a few essay reminisce about old shanghai , and the name wang qiyao suddenly come into the spotlight again .
one or two nosy reporter even go so far as to investigate what have happen to wang qiyao in the year follow the pageant ; several article be publish in the back page of the newspaper but fail to generate much interest , and the whole thing eventually die down .
a lot of time have indeed go by .
no matter how glamorous a woman have be , once she have enter the black hole of time , she be lucky to generate even a few flicker of light .
the aura surround the beauty pageant , no less than wang qiyao herself , have also fade after forty year , and it only serve to date she by reveal she age .
it be like the old clothes at the bottom of she chest : though many be still in good shape , wear they only make she look older , because they be from the wrong era .
the only one who seem to be move by any of this history be zhang yonghong .
she do not believe the story initially , but once she have accept it she have a endless array of question for wang qiyao .
wang qiyao , for she part , resist answer they at first , but once she begin to open up , she have a endless series of revelation for zhang yonghong to uncover .
there be many thing that wang qiyao think she have completely forget , but as soon as she get start , all of those tiny bit and fragment of detail come together to make a flow river of memory .
the story she tell be those of a woman who have stand in the limelight ; but be not that the goal of all those girl on huaihai road try to outdress one another ?
wave after wave of fashion that come and go — be not they all vie for they moment in the spotlight ?
zhang yonghong , who understand the magnitude of the splendor wang qiyao be describe , exclaim , " i be so envious ! "
zhang yonghong introduce wang qiyao to all of she boyfriend and invite she to all kind of party .
these be mostly party for young people , and , know she own place , wang qiyao would usually sit off to one side .
nevertheless , she elegance would still add a touch of distinction to the party .
bar the occasional glance , people do not pay she any attention , but everyone be aware that there be a " miss shanghai " in they presence .
on occasion there might even be a few people eagerly await she arrival , not realize that she have be sit in the corner all along — she sit there alone until the music stop and the show be over .
wang qiyao be always well dress and elegant ; she be never awkward and never get in the way .
she be a ornament , a painting on the wall to adorn the living room .
the painting be do in somber hue , with a dark yellow base ; it have true distinction , and even though the color be fade , its value have appreciate .
everything else be simply transient flash of light and shadow .
it be under these circumstance that old colour first meet wang qiyao .
could that be the " miss shanghai " everyone be talk about ? he wonder .
just as he be about to walk away , he see wang qiyao look up and scan the room before lower she head again .
the look in she eye have a hint of panic , but she be not at all look for sympathy or forgiveness .
it be then that old colour realize how callous he have be .
he think , the miss shanghai pageant be nearly forty year ago .
he vision grow blurry as he stare at wang qiyao , as if he eye could not focus properly , and through that hazy vision he see a image of she from more than three decade ago .
gradually the image become clearer , take on depth and new detail .
but none of those detail look real ; they float on the surface , pierce old colour 's heart .
he come face to face with a cruel reality — the corrosive power of time .
at twenty-six year of age , old colour should have be too young to care about the passing of time ; time have yet to teach he such truth , but that be precisely why he long for the past — that be the only reason he dare to extol the fruit of time !
the passage of time associate with those old jazz record be indeed a good thing ; it have smooth thing out until they be strong and fine , rub off the superficial layer to reveal the inner grain , like gold emerge when the fire have burn away the dross .
but what he see that day be not a object , like a old jazz record , but a person .
he be at a complete loss as to what to say , because the situation have a element of the tragic .
he have finally touch the heart of that bygone era , whereas before he have only pace back and forth on its surface .
something halt he step and old colour could not bring himself to walk away .
he pick up a glass of wine and lean up against the door , fix he gaze on the television .
eventually wang qiyao get up from the corner to go to the restroom .
as she walk past he , he flash she a smile .
she immediately accept he smile , respond with a look of gratitude before smile back at he .
when she come back , he ask she if he could get she a drink .
she point to the corner and say that she already have a cup of tea , so there be no need .
he ask she to dance .
she hesitate for a moment . . . and accept .
disco music be blare in the living room , but they dance the four-step at half speed .
with all manner of wild movement swirl around they , only they be stationary , like a lone island in a rush torrent .
she apologize , suggest that he go back to disco dancing rather than waste he time with she .
but he insist that he be have a good time .
he put he hand on she waist and could feel the slight pulsation of she body .
it be a strategy of nonmovement in response to the myriad change take place around she , of find she own rhythm , no matter what the tempo of she surroundings might be , a rhythm that could carry she through time .
move by this , he remain lose in silence until she suddenly compliment he dance skill ; they be now do a traditional latin number .
when the tune change , someone else invite wang qiyao to dance .
during the next number , they each dance with they respective partner but they eye occasionally meet , whereupon they exchange a know smile , light up with the joy of this chance meeting .
the party take place on the evening of national day and firework be be set off from one of the balcony .
a single rocket shoot up into the darkness and slowly unfurl its fiery petal in the night sky before break up into a stream of fall star , which vanish slowly , leave a faint white shadow in the sky .
it be some time before the last of the light be absorb into the blackness .
