and the earth be without form , and void ; and darkness be upon the face of the deep .
and the spirit of god move upon the face of the water .
and god say , let there be light : and there be light .
and god see the light , that it be good : and god divide the light from the darkness .
and god call the light day , and the darkness he call night .
and the evening and the morning be the first day .
and god say , let there be a firmament in the midst of the water , and let it divide the water from the water .
and god make the firmament , and divide the water which be under the firmament from the water which be above the firmament : and it be so .
and god call the firmament heaven .
and the evening and the morning be the second day .
and god say , let the water under the heaven be gather together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it be so .
and god call the dry land earth ; and the gathering together of the water call he sea : and god see that it be good .
and god say , let the earth bring forth grass , the herb yield seed , and the fruit tree yield fruit after he kind , whose seed be in itself , upon the earth : and it be so .
and the earth bring forth grass , and herb yielding seed after he kind , and the tree yield fruit , whose seed be in itself , after he kind : and god see that it be good .
and the evening and the morning be the third day .
and god say , let there be light in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let they be for sign , and for season , and for day , and year :
and let they be for light in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth : and it be so .
and god make two great light ; the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night : he make the star also .
and god set they in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth ,
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness : and god see that it be good .
and the evening and the morning be the fourth day .
and god say , let the water bring forth abundantly the move creature that have life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
and god create great whale , and every living creature that moveth , which the water bring forth abundantly , after they kind , and every winged fowl after he kind : and god see that it be good .
and god bless they , say , be fruitful , and multiply , and fill the water in the sea , and let fowl multiply in the earth .

and on the seventh day god end he work which he have make ; and he rest on the seventh day from all he work which he have make .
and god bless the seventh day , and sanctify it : because that in it he have rest from all he work which god create and make .
these be the generation of the heaven and of the earth when they be create , in the day that the lord god make the earth and the heaven ,
and every plant of the field before it be in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grow : for the lord god have not cause it to rain upon the earth , and there be not a man to till the ground .
but there go up a mist from the earth , and water the whole face of the ground .
and the lord god form man of the dust of the ground , and breathe into he nostril the breath of life ; and man become a living soul .
and the lord god plant a garden eastward in eden ; and there he put the man whom he have form .
and out of the ground make the lord god to grow every tree that be pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
and a river go out of eden to water the garden ; and from thence it be part , and become into four head .
the name of the first be pison : that be it which compasseth the whole land of havilah , where there be gold ;
and the gold of that land be good : there be bdellium and the onyx stone .
and the name of the second river be gihon : the same be it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia .
and the name of the third river be hiddekel : that be it which goeth toward the east of assyria .
and the fourth river be euphrates .
and the lord god take the man , and put he into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it .
and the lord god command the man , say , of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat :
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die .
and the lord god say , it be not good that the man should be alone ; i will make he a help meet for he .
and out of the ground the lord god form every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air ; and bring they unto adam to see what he would call they : and whatsoever adam call every living creature , that be the name thereof .
and adam give name to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for adam there be not find a help meet for he .
and the lord god cause a deep sleep to fall upon adam , and he sleep : and he take one of he rib , and close up the flesh instead thereof ;
and the rib , which the lord god have take from man , make he a woman , and bring she unto the man .
and adam say , this be now bone of my bone , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be call woman , because she be take out of man .
therefore shall a man leave he father and he mother , and shall cleave unto he wife : and they shall be one flesh .
and they be both naked , the man and he wife , and be not ashamed .
now the serpent be more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god have make .
and he say unto the woman , yea , have god say , ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
and the woman say unto the serpent , we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden :
but of the fruit of the tree which be in the midst of the garden , god have say , ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and the serpent say unto the woman , ye shall not surely die :
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then you eye shall be open , and ye shall be as god , know good and evil .
and when the woman see that the tree be good for food , and that it be pleasant to the eye , and a tree to be desire to make one wise , she take of the fruit thereof , and do eat , and give also unto she husband with she ; and he do eat .
and the eye of they both be open , and they know that they be naked ; and they sew fig leaf together , and make themselves apron .
and they hear the voice of the lord god walk in the garden in the cool of the day : and adam and he wife hide themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the tree of the garden .
and the lord god call unto adam , and say unto he , where art thou ?
and he say , i hear thy voice in the garden , and i be afraid , because i be naked ; and i hide myself .
and he say , who tell thee that thou wast naked ?
hast thou eat of the tree , whereof i command thee that thou shouldest not eat ?
and the man say , the woman whom thou gavest to be with i , she give i of the tree , and i do eat .
and the lord god say unto the woman , what be this that thou hast do ?
and the woman say , the serpent beguile i , and i do eat .
and the lord god say unto the serpent , because thou hast do this , thou art curse above all cattle , and above every beast of the field ; upon thy belly shalt thou go , and dust shalt thou eat all the day of thy life :
and i will put enmity between thee and the woman , and between thy seed and she seed ; it shall bruise thy head , and thou shalt bruise he heel .
unto the woman he say , i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth child ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
and unto adam he say , because thou hast hearken unto the voice of thy wife , and hast eat of the tree , of which i command thee , say , thou shalt not eat of it : curse be the ground for thy sake ; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the day of thy life ;
thorns also and thistle shall it bring forth to thee ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ;
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it be thou take : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
and adam call he wife 's name eve ; because she be the mother of all living .
unto adam also and to he wife do the lord god make coat of skin , and clothe they .
and the lord god say , behold , the man be become as one of we , to know good and evil : and now , lest he put forth he hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever :
therefore the lord god send he forth from the garden of eden , to till the ground from whence he be take .
so he drive out the man ; and he place at the east of the garden of eden cherubims , and a flaming sword which turn every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
and adam know eve he wife ; and she conceive , and bare cain , and say , i have get a man from the lord .
and she again bare he brother abel .
and abel be a keeper of sheep , but cain be a tiller of the ground .
and in process of time it come to pass , that cain bring of the fruit of the ground a offering unto the lord .
and abel , he also bring of the firstling of he flock and of the fat thereof .
and the lord have respect unto abel and to he offering :
but unto cain and to he offering he have not respect .
and cain be very wroth , and he countenance fell .
and the lord say unto cain , why art thou wroth ? and why be thy countenance fall ?
if thou doest well , shalt thou not be accept ? and if thou doest not well , sin lieth at the door .
and unto thee shall be he desire , and thou shalt rule over he .
and cain talk with abel he brother : and it come to pass , when they be in the field , that cain rise up against abel he brother , and slew he .
and the lord say unto cain , where be abel thy brother ?
and he say , i know not : be i my brother 's keeper ?
and he say , what hast thou do ? the voice of thy brother 's blood crieth unto i from the ground .
and now art thou curse from the earth , which have open she mouth to receive thy brother 's blood from thy hand ;
when thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee she strength ; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth .
and cain say unto the lord , my punishment be greater than i can bear .
behold , thou hast drive i out this day from the face of the earth ; and from thy face shall i be hide ; and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth ; and it shall come to pass , that every one that findeth i shall slay i .
and the lord say unto he , therefore whosoever slayeth cain , vengeance shall be take on he sevenfold .
and the lord set a mark upon cain , lest any find he should kill he .
and cain go out from the presence of the lord , and dwelt in the land of nod , on the east of eden .
and cain know he wife ; and she conceive , and bare enoch : and he build a city , and call the name of the city , after the name of he son , enoch .
and unto enoch be bear irad : and irad beget mehujael : and mehujael beget methusael : and methusael beget lamech .
and lamech take unto he two wife : the name of the one be adah , and the name of the other zillah .
and adah bare jabal : he be the father of such as dwell in tent , and of such as have cattle .
and he brother 's name be jubal : he be the father of all such as handle the harp and organ .
and zillah , she also bare tubalcain , a instructer of every artificer in brass and iron : and the sister of tubalcain be naamah .
and lamech say unto he wife , adah and zillah , hear my voice ; ye wife of lamech , hearken unto my speech : for i have slay a man to my wounding , and a young man to my hurt .
if cain shall be avenge sevenfold , truly lamech seventy and sevenfold .
and adam know he wife again ; and she bare a son , and call he name seth : for god , say she , have appoint i another seed instead of abel , whom cain slew .
and to seth , to he also there be bear a son ; and he call he name enos : then begin man to call upon the name of the lord .
this be the book of the generation of adam .
in the day that god create man , in the likeness of god make he he ;
male and female create he they ; and bless they , and call they name adam , in the day when they be create .
and adam live a hundred and thirty year , and beget a son in he own likeness , after he image ; and call he name seth :

and it come to pass , when man begin to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughter be bear unto they ,
that the son of god see the daughter of man that they be fair ; and they take they wife of all which they choose .
and the lord say , my spirit shall not always strive with man , for that he also be flesh : yet he day shall be a hundred and twenty year .
there be giant in the earth in those day ; and also after that , when the son of god come in unto the daughter of man , and they bare child to they , the same become mighty man which be of old , man of renown .
and god see that the wickedness of man be great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thought of he heart be only evil continually .
and it repent the lord that he have make man on the earth , and it grieve he at he heart .
and the lord say , i will destroy man whom i have create from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the creep thing , and the fowl of the air ; for it repenteth i that i have make they .
but noah find grace in the eye of the lord .
these be the generation of noah : noah be a just man and perfect in he generation , and noah walk with god .
and noah beget three son , shem , ham , and japheth .
the earth also be corrupt before god , and the earth be fill with violence .
and god look upon the earth , and , behold , it be corrupt ; for all flesh have corrupt he way upon the earth .
and god say unto noah , the end of all flesh be come before i ; for the earth be fill with violence through they ; and , behold , i will destroy they with the earth .
make thee a ark of gopher wood ; room shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
and this be the fashion which thou shalt make it of : the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubit , the breadth of it fifty cubit , and the height of it thirty cubit .
a window shalt thou make to the ark , and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above ; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof ; with lower , second , and third story shalt thou make it .
and , behold , i , even i , do bring a flood of water upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein be the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that be in the earth shall die .
but with thee will i establish my covenant ; and thou shalt come into the ark , thou , and thy son , and thy wife , and thy son ' wife with thee .
and of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark , to keep they alive with thee ; they shall be male and female .
of fowl after they kind , and of cattle after they kind , of every creep thing of the earth after he kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep they alive .
and take thou unto thee of all food that be eat , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for they .
thus do noah ; accord to all that god command he , so do he .
and the lord say unto noah , come thou and all thy house into the ark ; for thee have i see righteous before i in this generation .
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by seven , the male and he female : and of beast that be not clean by two , the male and he female .

and noah do accord unto all that the lord command he .
and noah be six hundred year old when the flood of water be upon the earth .
and noah go in , and he son , and he wife , and he son ' wife with he , into the ark , because of the water of the flood .
of clean beast , and of beast that be not clean , and of fowl , and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth ,
there go in two and two unto noah into the ark , the male and the female , as god have command noah .
and it come to pass after seven day , that the water of the flood be upon the earth .

and they go in unto noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein be the breath of life .
and they that go in , go in male and female of all flesh , as god have command he : and the lord shut he in .
and the flood be forty day upon the earth ; and the water increase , and bare up the ark , and it be lift up above the earth .
and the water prevail , and be increase greatly upon the earth ; and the ark go upon the face of the water .
and the water prevail exceedingly upon the earth ; and all the high hill , that be under the whole heaven , be cover .
fifteen cubit upward do the water prevail ; and the mountain be cover .
and all flesh die that move upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every creep thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man :
all in whose nostril be the breath of life , of all that be in the dry land , die .
and every living substance be destroy which be upon the face of the ground , both man , and cattle , and the creep thing , and the fowl of the heaven ; and they be destroy from the earth : and noah only remain alive , and they that be with he in the ark .
and the water prevail upon the earth a hundred and fifty day .
and god remember noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that be with he in the ark : and god make a wind to pass over the earth , and the water asswage ;

and it come to pass at the end of forty day , that noah open the window of the ark which he have make :
and he send forth a raven , which go forth to and fro , until the water be dry up from off the earth .
also he send forth a dive from he , to see if the water be abate from off the face of the ground ;
but the dive find no rest for the sole of she foot , and she return unto he into the ark , for the water be on the face of the whole earth : then he put forth he hand , and take she , and pull she in unto he into the ark .
and he stay yet other seven day ; and again he send forth the dive out of the ark ;
and the dive come in to he in the evening ; and , lo , in she mouth be a olive leaf pluckt off : so noah know that the water be abate from off the earth .
and he stay yet other seven day ; and send forth the dive ; which return not again unto he any more .
and it come to pass in the six hundredth and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the water be dry up from off the earth : and noah remove the covering of the ark , and look , and , behold , the face of the ground be dry .
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , be the earth dry .
and god speak unto noah , say ,
go forth of the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy son , and thy son ' wife with thee .
bring forth with thee every living thing that be with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creep thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
and noah go forth , and he son , and he wife , and he son ' wife with he :
every beast , every creep thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after they kind , go forth out of the ark .
and noah build a altar unto the lord ; and take of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offer burnt offering on the altar .
and the lord smell a sweet savour ; and the lord say in he heart , i will not again curse the ground any more for man 's sake ; for the imagination of man 's heart be evil from he youth ; neither will i again smite any more every thing living , as i have do .
while the earth remaineth , seedtime and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease .
and god bless noah and he son , and say unto they , be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth .
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth , and upon every fowl of the air , upon all that moveth upon the earth , and upon all the fish of the sea ; into you hand be they deliver .
every move thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have i give you all thing .
but flesh with the life thereof , which be the blood thereof , shall ye not eat .
and surely you blood of you life will i require ; at the hand of every beast will i require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will i require the life of man .
whoso sheddeth man 's blood , by man shall he blood be shed : for in the image of god make he man .
and you , be ye fruitful , and multiply ; bring forth abundantly in the earth , and multiply therein .
and god speak unto noah , and to he son with he , say ,
and i , behold , i establish my covenant with you , and with you seed after you ;
and with every living creature that be with you , of the fowl , of the cattle , and of every beast of the earth with you ; from all that go out of the ark , to every beast of the earth .
and i will establish my covenant with you ; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the water of a flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth .
and god say , this be the token of the covenant which i make between i and you and every living creature that be with you , for perpetual generation :
i do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between i and the earth .
and it shall come to pass , when i bring a cloud over the earth , that the bow shall be see in the cloud :
and i will remember my covenant , which be between i and you and every living creature of all flesh ; and the water shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
and the bow shall be in the cloud ; and i will look upon it , that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that be upon the earth .
and god say unto noah , this be the token of the covenant , which i have establish between i and all flesh that be upon the earth .

and it come to pass , as they journey from the east , that they find a plain in the land of shinar ; and they dwell there .
and they say one to another , go to , let we make brick , and burn they thoroughly .
and they have brick for stone , and slime have they for morter .
and they say , go to , let we build we a city and a tower , whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let we make we a name , lest we be scatter abroad upon the face of the whole earth .
and the lord come down to see the city and the tower , which the child of man build .
and the lord say , behold , the people be one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrain from they , which they have imagine to do .
go to , let we go down , and there confound they language , that they may not understand one another 's speech .
so the lord scatter they abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth : and they leave off to build the city .
therefore be the name of it call babel ; because the lord do there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence do the lord scatter they abroad upon the face of all the earth .
these be the generation of shem : shem be a hundred year old , and begat arphaxad two year after the flood :
and shem live after he beget arphaxad five hundred year , and begat son and daughter .
and arphaxad live five and thirty year , and beget salah :
and arphaxad live after he beget salah four hundred and three year , and begat son and daughter .
and salah live thirty year , and beget eber :
and salah live after he beget eber four hundred and three year , and begat son and daughter .
and eber live four and thirty year , and beget peleg :
and eber live after he beget peleg four hundred and thirty year , and begat son and daughter .
and peleg live thirty year , and begat reu :
and peleg live after he beget reu two hundred and nine year , and begat son and daughter .
and reu live two and thirty year , and beget serug :
and reu live after he beget serug two hundred and seven year , and begat son and daughter .
and serug live thirty year , and beget nahor :
and serug live after he beget nahor two hundred year , and begat son and daughter .
and nahor live nine and twenty year , and beget terah :
and nahor live after he beget terah a hundred and nineteen year , and begat son and daughter .
and terah live seventy year , and beget abram , nahor , and haran .
now these be the generation of terah : terah beget abram , nahor , and haran ; and haran beget lot .
and haran die before he father terah in the land of he nativity , in ur of the chaldees .
and abram and nahor take they wife : the name of abram 's wife be sarai ; and the name of nahor 's wife , milcah , the daughter of haran , the father of milcah , and the father of iscah .
but sarai be barren ; she have no child .
and terah take abram he son , and lot the son of haran he son 's son , and sarai he daughter in law , he son abram 's wife ; and they go forth with they from ur of the chaldees , to go into the land of canaan ; and they come unto haran , and dwelt there .
and the day of terah be two hundred and five year : and terah die in haran .
now the lord have say unto abram , get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and from thy father 's house , unto a land that i will shew thee :
and i will make of thee a great nation , and i will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and thou shalt be a blessing :
and i will bless they that bless thee , and curse he that curseth thee : and in thee shall all family of the earth be bless .
so abram depart , as the lord have speak unto he ; and lot go with he : and abram be seventy and five year old when he depart out of haran .
and abram take sarai he wife , and lot he brother 's son , and all they substance that they have gather , and the soul that they have get in haran ; and they go forth to go into the land of canaan ; and into the land of canaan they come .
and abram pass through the land unto the place of sichem , unto the plain of moreh .
and the canaanite be then in the land .
and the lord appear unto abram , and say , unto thy seed will i give this land : and there build he a altar unto the lord , who appear unto he .
and he remove from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel , and pitch he tent , have bethel on the west , and hai on the east : and there he build a altar unto the lord , and call upon the name of the lord .
and abram journey , go on still toward the south .
and there be a famine in the land : and abram go down into egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine be grievous in the land .
and it come to pass , when he be come near to enter into egypt , that he say unto sarai he wife , behold now , i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
therefore it shall come to pass , when the egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , this be he wife : and they will kill i , but they will save thee alive .
say , i pray thee , thou art my sister : that it may be well with i for thy sake ; and my soul shall live because of thee .
and it come to pass , that , when abram be come into egypt , the egyptians behold the woman that she be very fair .
the prince also of pharaoh see she , and commend she before pharaoh : and the woman be take into pharaoh 's house .
and he entreat abram well for she sake : and he have sheep , and ox , and he ass , and manservant , and maidservant , and she ass , and camel .
and the lord plague pharaoh and he house with great plague because of sarai abram 's wife .
and pharaoh call abram , and say , what be this that thou hast do unto i ? why didst thou not tell i that she be thy wife ?
why saidst thou , she be my sister ? so i might have take she to i to wife : now therefore behold thy wife , take she , and go thy way .
and pharaoh command he man concern he : and they send he away , and he wife , and all that he have .
and abram go up out of egypt , he , and he wife , and all that he have , and lot with he , into the south .
and abram be very rich in cattle , in silver , and in gold .
and he go on he journey from the south even to bethel , unto the place where he tent have be at the beginning , between bethel and hai ;
unto the place of the altar , which he have make there at the first : and there abram call on the name of the lord .
and lot also , which go with abram , have flock , and herd , and tent .
and the land be not able to bear they , that they might dwell together : for they substance be great , so that they could not dwell together .
and there be a strife between the herdman of abram 's cattle and the herdman of lot 's cattle : and the canaanite and the perizzite dwell then in the land .
and abram say unto lot , let there be no strife , i pray thee , between i and thee , and between my herdman and thy herdman ; for we be brethren .
be not the whole land before thee ? separate thyself , i pray thee , from i : if thou wilt take the left hand , then i will go to the right ; or if thou depart to the right hand , then i will go to the left .
and lot lift up he eye , and behold all the plain of jordan , that it be well water every where , before the lord destroy sodom and gomorrah , even as the garden of the lord , like the land of egypt , as thou comest unto zoar .
then lot choose he all the plain of jordan ; and lot journey east : and they separate themselves the one from the other .
abram dwell in the land of canaan , and lot dwell in the city of the plain , and pitch he tent toward sodom .
but the man of sodom be wicked and sinner before the lord exceedingly .
and the lord say unto abram , after that lot be separate from he , lift up now thine eye , and look from the place where thou art northward , and southward , and eastward , and westward :
for all the land which thou seest , to thee will i give it , and to thy seed for ever .
and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be number .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for i will give it unto thee .
then abram remove he tent , and come and dwelt in the plain of mamre , which be in hebron , and build there a altar unto the lord .
and it come to pass in the day of amraphel king of shinar , arioch king of ellasar , chedorlaomer king of elam , and tidal king of nation ;
that these make war with bera king of sodom , and with birsha king of gomorrah , shinab king of admah , and shemeber king of zeboiim , and the king of bela , which be zoar .
all these be join together in the vale of siddim , which be the salt sea .
twelve year they serve chedorlaomer , and in the thirteenth year they rebel .
and in the fourteenth year come chedorlaomer , and the king that be with he , and smite the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim , and the zuzims in ham , and the emim in shaveh kiriathaim ,
and the horites in they mount seir , unto elparan , which be by the wilderness .
and they return , and come to enmishpat , which be kadesh , and smite all the country of the amalekites , and also the amorites , that dwelt in hazezontamar .
and there go out the king of sodom , and the king of gomorrah , and the king of admah , and the king of zeboiim , and the king of bela ( the same be zoar ; ) and they join battle with they in the vale of siddim ;
with chedorlaomer the king of elam , and with tidal king of nation , and amraphel king of shinar , and arioch king of ellasar ; four king with five .
and the vale of siddim be full of slimepit ; and the king of sodom and gomorrah flee , and fall there ; and they that remain flee to the mountain .
and they take all the goods of sodom and gomorrah , and all they victuals , and go they way .
and they take lot , abram 's brother 's son , who dwell in sodom , and he goods , and depart .
and there come one that have escape , and tell abram the hebrew ; for he dwell in the plain of mamre the amorite , brother of eshcol , and brother of aner : and these be confederate with abram .
and when abram hear that he brother be take captive , he arm he trained servant , bear in he own house , three hundred and eighteen , and pursue they unto dan .
and he divide himself against they , he and he servant , by night , and smite they , and pursue they unto hobah , which be on the left hand of damascus .
and he bring back all the goods , and also bring again he brother lot , and he goods , and the woman also , and the people .
and the king of sodom go out to meet he after he return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer , and of the king that be with he , at the valley of shaveh , which be the king 's dale .
and melchizedek king of salem bring forth bread and wine : and he be the priest of the most high god .
and he bless he , and say , blessed be abram of the most high god , possessor of heaven and earth :
and bless be the most high god , which have deliver thine enemy into thy hand .
and he give he tithe of all .
and the king of sodom say unto abram , give i the person , and take the goods to thyself .
and abram say to the king of sodom , i have lift up mine hand unto the lord , the most high god , the possessor of heaven and earth ,
that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet , and that i will not take any thing that be thine , lest thou shouldest say , i have make abram rich :
save only that which the young man have eat , and the portion of the man which go with i , aner , eshcol , and mamre ; let they take they portion .
after these thing the word of the lord come unto abram in a vision , say , fear not , abram : i be thy shield , and thy exceed great reward .
and abram say , lord god , what wilt thou give i , see i go childless , and the steward of my house be this eliezer of damascus ?
and abram say , behold , to i thou hast give no seed : and , lo , one bear in my house be mine heir .
and , behold , the word of the lord come unto he , say , this shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
and he bring he forth abroad , and say , look now toward heaven , and tell the star , if thou be able to number they : and he say unto he , so shall thy seed be .
and he believe in the lord ; and he count it to he for righteousness .
and he say unto he , i be the lord that bring thee out of ur of the chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it .
and he say , lord god , whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it ?
and he say unto he , take i a heifer of three year old , and a she goat of three year old , and a ram of three year old , and a turtledove , and a young pigeon .
and he take unto he all these , and divide they in the midst , and lay each piece one against another : but the bird divide he not .
and when the fowl come down upon the carcase , abram drive they away .
and when the sun be go down , a deep sleep fall upon abram ; and , lo , a horror of great darkness fall upon he .
and he say unto abram , know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that be not theirs , and shall serve they ; and they shall afflict they four hundred year ;
and also that nation , whom they shall serve , will i judge : and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
and thou shalt go to thy father in peace ; thou shalt be bury in a good old age .
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again : for the iniquity of the amorites be not yet full .
and it come to pass , that , when the sun go down , and it be dark , behold a smoking furnace , and a burning lamp that pass between those piece .
in the same day the lord make a covenant with abram , say , unto thy seed have i give this land , from the river of egypt unto the great river , the river euphrates :
the kenites , and the kenizzites , and the kadmonites ,
and the hittites , and the perizzites , and the rephaims ,
and the amorites , and the canaanites , and the girgashites , and the jebusites .
now sarai abram 's wife bare he no child : and she have a handmaid , a egyptian , whose name be hagar .
and sarai say unto abram , behold now , the lord have restrain i from bearing : i pray thee , go in unto my maid ; it may be that i may obtain child by she .
and abram hearken to the voice of sarai .
and sarai abram 's wife take hagar she maid the egyptian , after abram have dwell ten year in the land of canaan , and give she to she husband abram to be he wife .
and he go in unto hagar , and she conceive : and when she see that she have conceive , she mistress be despise in she eye .
and sarai say unto abram , my wrong be upon thee : i have give my maid into thy bosom ; and when she see that she have conceive , i be despise in she eye : the lord judge between i and thee .
but abram say unto sarai , behold , thy maid be in thy hand ; do to she as it pleaseth thee .
and when sarai deal hardly with she , she flee from she face .
and the angel of the lord find she by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to shur .
and he say , hagar , sarai 's maid , whence camest thou ? and whither wilt thou go ?
and she say , i flee from the face of my mistress sarai .
and the angel of the lord say unto she , return to thy mistress , and submit thyself under she hand .
and the angel of the lord say unto she , i will multiply thy seed exceedingly , that it shall not be number for multitude .
and the angel of the lord say unto she , behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call he name ishmael ; because the lord have hear thy affliction .
and he will be a wild man ; he hand will be against every man , and every man 's hand against he ; and he shall dwell in the presence of all he brethren .
and she call the name of the lord that speak unto she , thou god seest i : for she say , have i also here look after he that seeth i ?
wherefore the well be call beerlahairoi ; behold , it be between kadesh and bered .
and hagar bare abram a son : and abram call he son 's name , which hagar bare , ishmael .
and abram be fourscore and six year old , when hagar bare ishmael to abram .
and when abram be ninety year old and nine , the lord appear to abram , and say unto he , i be the almighty god ; walk before i , and be thou perfect .
and i will make my covenant between i and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly .
and abram fall on he face : and god talk with he , say ,
as for i , behold , my covenant be with thee , and thou shalt be a father of many nation .
neither shall thy name any more be call abram , but thy name shall be abraham ; for a father of many nation have i make thee .
and i will make thee exceed fruitful , and i will make nation of thee , and king shall come out of thee .
and i will establish my covenant between i and thee and thy seed after thee in they generation for a everlasting covenant , to be a god unto thee , and to thy seed after thee .
and i will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of canaan , for a everlasting possession ; and i will be they god .
and god say unto abraham , thou shalt keep my covenant therefore , thou , and thy seed after thee in they generation .
this be my covenant , which ye shall keep , between i and you and thy seed after thee ; every man child among you shall be circumcise .
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of you foreskin ; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt i and you .
and he that be eight day old shall be circumcise among you , every man child in you generation , he that be bear in the house , or buy with money of any stranger , which be not of thy seed .
he that be bear in thy house , and he that be buy with thy money , must need be circumcise : and my covenant shall be in you flesh for a everlasting covenant .
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of he foreskin be not circumcise , that soul shall be cut off from he people ; he have broken my covenant .
and god say unto abraham , as for sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call she name sarai , but sarah shall she name be .
and i will bless she , and give thee a son also of she : yea , i will bless she , and she shall be a mother of nation ; king of people shall be of she .
then abraham fall upon he face , and laugh , and say in he heart , shall a child be bear unto he that be a hundred year old ? and shall sarah , that be ninety year old , bear ?
and abraham say unto god , o that ishmael might live before thee !
and god say , sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed ; and thou shalt call he name isaac : and i will establish my covenant with he for a everlasting covenant , and with he seed after he .
and as for ishmael , i have hear thee : behold , i have bless he , and will make he fruitful , and will multiply he exceedingly ; twelve prince shall he beget , and i will make he a great nation .
but my covenant will i establish with isaac , which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year .
and he leave off talk with he , and god go up from abraham .
and abraham take ishmael he son , and all that be bear in he house , and all that be buy with he money , every male among the man of abraham 's house ; and circumcise the flesh of they foreskin in the selfsame day , as god have say unto he .
and abraham be ninety year old and nine , when he be circumcise in the flesh of he foreskin .
and ishmael he son be thirteen year old , when he be circumcise in the flesh of he foreskin .
in the selfsame day be abraham circumcise , and ishmael he son .
and all the man of he house , bear in the house , and buy with money of the stranger , be circumcise with he .
and the lord appear unto he in the plain of mamre : and he sit in the tent door in the heat of the day ;
and he lift up he eye and look , and , lo , three man stand by he : and when he see they , he run to meet they from the tent door , and bow himself toward the ground ,
and say , my lord , if now i have find favour in thy sight , pass not away , i pray thee , from thy servant :
let a little water , i pray you , be fetch , and wash you foot , and rest yourselve under the tree :
and i will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye you heart ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore be ye come to you servant .
and they say , so do , as thou hast say .
and abraham hasten into the tent unto sarah , and say , make ready quickly three measure of fine meal , knead it , and make cake upon the hearth .
and abraham run unto the herd , and fetcht a calf tender and good , and give it unto a young man ; and he hast to dress it .
and he take butter , and milk , and the calf which he have dress , and set it before they ; and he stand by they under the tree , and they do eat .
and they say unto he , where be sarah thy wife ?
and he say , behold , in the tent .
and he say , i will certainly return unto thee accord to the time of life ; and , lo , sarah thy wife shall have a son .
and sarah hear it in the tent door , which be behind he .
now abraham and sarah be old and well stricken in age ; and it cease to be with sarah after the manner of woman .
therefore sarah laugh within herself , say , after i be wax old shall i have pleasure , my lord be old also ?
and the lord say unto abraham , wherefore do sarah laugh , say , shall i of a surety bear a child , which be old ?
be any thing too hard for the lord ?
at the time appoint i will return unto thee , accord to the time of life , and sarah shall have a son .
then sarah deny , say , i laugh not ; for she be afraid .
and he say , nay ; but thou didst laugh .
and the man rise up from thence , and look toward sodom : and abraham go with they to bring they on the way .
and the lord say , shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do ;
see that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nation of the earth shall be bless in he ?
for i know he , that he will command he child and he household after he , and they shall keep the way of the lord , to do justice and judgment ; that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he have speak of he .
and the lord say , because the cry of sodom and gomorrah be great , and because they sin be very grievous ;
i will go down now , and see whether they have do altogether accord to the cry of it , which be come unto i ; and if not , i will know .
and the man turn they face from thence , and go toward sodom : but abraham stand yet before the lord .
and abraham draw near , and say , wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked ?
peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city : wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that be therein ?
that be far from thee to do after this manner , to slay the righteous with the wicked : and that the righteous should be as the wicked , that be far from thee : shall not the judge of all the earth do right ?
and the lord say , if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city , then i will spare all the place for they sake .
and abraham answer and say , behold now , i have take upon i to speak unto the lord , which be but dust and ash :
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous : wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five ?
and he say , if i find there forty and five , i will not destroy it .
and he speak unto he yet again , and say , peradventure there shall be forty find there .
and he say , i will not do it for forty 's sake .
and he say unto he , oh let not the lord be angry , and i will speak : peradventure there shall thirty be find there .
and he say , i will not do it , if i find thirty there .
and he say , behold now , i have take upon i to speak unto the lord : peradventure there shall be twenty find there .
and he say , i will not destroy it for twenty 's sake .
and he say , oh let not the lord be angry , and i will speak yet but this once : peradventure ten shall be find there .
and he say , i will not destroy it for ten 's sake .
and the lord go he way , as soon as he have leave commune with abraham : and abraham return unto he place .
and there come two angel to sodom at even ; and lot sit in the gate of sodom : and lot see they rise up to meet they ; and he bow himself with he face toward the ground ;
and he say , behold now , my lord , turn in , i pray you , into you servant 's house , and tarry all night , and wash you foot , and ye shall rise up early , and go on you way .
and they say , nay ; but we will abide in the street all night .
and he press upon they greatly ; and they turn in unto he , and enter into he house ; and he make they a feast , and do bake unleavened bread , and they do eat .
but before they lay down , the man of the city , even the man of sodom , compass the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and they call unto lot , and say unto he , where be the man which come in to thee this night ? bring they out unto we , that we may know they .
and lot go out at the door unto they , and shut the door after he ,
and say , i pray you , brethren , do not so wickedly .
behold now , i have two daughter which have not know man ; let i , i pray you , bring they out unto you , and do ye to they as be good in you eye : only unto these man do nothing ; for therefore come they under the shadow of my roof .
and they say , stand back .
and they say again , this one fellow come in to sojourn , and he will need be a judge : now will we deal worse with thee , than with they .
and they press sore upon the man , even lot , and come near to break the door .
but the man put forth they hand , and pull lot into the house to they , and shut to the door .
and they smite the man that be at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they weary themselves to find the door .
and the man say unto lot , hast thou here any besides ? son in law , and thy son , and thy daughter , and whatsoever thou hast in the city , bring they out of this place :
for we will destroy this place , because the cry of they be waxen great before the face of the lord ; and the lord have send we to destroy it .
and lot go out , and spake unto he son in law , which marry he daughter , and say , up , get you out of this place ; for the lord will destroy this city .
but he seem as one that mock unto he son in law .
and when the morning arise , then the angel hasten lot , say , arise , take thy wife , and thy two daughter , which be here ; lest thou be consume in the iniquity of the city .
and while he linger , the man lay hold upon he hand , and upon the hand of he wife , and upon the hand of he two daughter ; the lord be merciful unto he : and they bring he forth , and set he without the city .
and it come to pass , when they have bring they forth abroad , that he say , escape for thy life ; look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain , lest thou be consume .
and lot say unto they , oh , not so , my lord :
behold now , thy servant have find grace in thy sight , and thou hast magnify thy mercy , which thou hast shew unto i in save my life ; and i can not escape to the mountain , lest some evil take i , and i die :
behold now , this city be near to flee unto , and it be a little one : oh , let i escape thither , ( be it not a little one ? ) and my soul shall live .
and he say unto he , see , i have accept thee concern this thing also , that i will not overthrow this city , for the which thou hast speak .
haste thee , escape thither ; for i can not do anything till thou be come thither .
therefore the name of the city be call zoar .
the sun be rise upon the earth when lot enter into zoar .
then the lord rain upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven ;
and he overthrow those city , and all the plain , and all the inhabitant of the city , and that which grow upon the ground .
but he wife look back from behind he , and she become a pillar of salt .
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stand before the lord :
and he look toward sodom and gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country go up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it come to pass , when god destroy the city of the plain , that god remember abraham , and send lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrow the city in the which lot dwelt .
and lot go up out of zoar , and dwelt in the mountain , and he two daughter with he ; for he fear to dwell in zoar : and he dwell in a cave , he and he two daughter .
and the firstborn say unto the younger , we father be old , and there be not a man in the earth to come in unto we after the manner of all the earth :
come , let we make we father drink wine , and we will lie with he , that we may preserve seed of we father .
and they make they father drink wine that night : and the firstborn go in , and lay with she father ; and he perceive not when she lay down , nor when she arise .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that the firstborn say unto the younger , behold , i lay yesternight with my father : let we make he drink wine this night also ; and go thou in , and lie with he , that we may preserve seed of we father .
and they make they father drink wine that night also : and the younger arise , and lay with he ; and he perceive not when she lay down , nor when she arise .
thus be both the daughter of lot with child by they father .
and the first bear bare a son , and call he name moab : the same be the father of the moabites unto this day .
and the younger , she also bare a son , and call he name benammi : the same be the father of the child of ammon unto this day .
and abraham journey from thence toward the south country , and dwell between kadesh and shur , and sojourn in gerar .
and abraham say of sarah he wife , she be my sister : and abimelech king of gerar send , and take sarah .
but god come to abimelech in a dream by night , and say to he , behold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast take ; for she be a man 's wife .
but abimelech have not come near she : and he say , lord , wilt thou slay also a righteous nation ?
said he not unto i , she be my sister ? and she , even she herself say , he be my brother : in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hand have i do this .
and god say unto he in a dream , yea , i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart ; for i also withhold thee from sin against i : therefore suffer i thee not to touch she .
now therefore restore the man he wife ; for he be a prophet , and he shall pray for thee , and thou shalt live : and if thou restore she not , know thou that thou shalt surely die , thou , and all that be thine .
therefore abimelech rise early in the morning , and call all he servant , and tell all these thing in they ear : and the man be sore afraid .
then abimelech call abraham , and say unto he , what hast thou do unto we ? and what have i offend thee , that thou hast bring on i and on my kingdom a great sin ? thou hast do deed unto i that ought not to be do .
and abimelech say unto abraham , what sawest thou , that thou hast do this thing ?
and abraham say , because i think , surely the fear of god be not in this place ; and they will slay i for my wife 's sake .
and yet indeed she be my sister ; she be the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she become my wife .
and it come to pass , when god cause i to wander from my father 's house , that i say unto she , this be thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto i ; at every place whither we shall come , say of i , he be my brother .
and abimelech take sheep , and ox , and manservant , and womenservant , and give they unto abraham , and restore he sarah he wife .
and abimelech say , behold , my land be before thee : dwell where it pleaseth thee .
and unto sarah he say , behold , i have give thy brother a thousand piece of silver : behold , he be to thee a covering of the eye , unto all that be with thee , and with all other : thus she be reprove .
so abraham pray unto god : and god heal abimelech , and he wife , and he maidservant ; and they bare child .
for the lord have fast close up all the womb of the house of abimelech , because of sarah abraham 's wife .
and the lord visit sarah as he have say , and the lord do unto sarah as he have speak .
for sarah conceive , and bare abraham a son in he old age , at the set time of which god have speak to he .
and abraham call the name of he son that be bear unto he , whom sarah bare to he , isaac .
and abraham circumcise he son isaac be eight day old , as god have command he .
and abraham be a hundred year old , when he son isaac be bear unto he .
and sarah say , god have make i to laugh , so that all that hear will laugh with i .
and she say , who would have say unto abraham , that sarah should have give child suck ? for i have bear he a son in he old age .
and the child grow , and be wean : and abraham make a great feast the same day that isaac be wean .
and sarah see the son of hagar the egyptian , which she have bear unto abraham , mock .
wherefore she say unto abraham , cast out this bondwoman and she son : for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with isaac .
and the thing be very grievous in abraham 's sight because of he son .
and god say unto abraham , let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad , and because of thy bondwoman ; in all that sarah have say unto thee , hearken unto she voice ; for in isaac shall thy seed be call .
and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation , because he be thy seed .
and abraham rise up early in the morning , and take bread , and a bottle of water , and give it unto hagar , put it on she shoulder , and the child , and send she away : and she depart , and wander in the wilderness of beersheba .
and the water be spend in the bottle , and she cast the child under one of the shrub .
and she go , and sit she down over against he a good way off , as it be a bow shot : for she say , let i not see the death of the child .
and she sit over against he , and lift up she voice , and weep .
and god hear the voice of the lad ; and the angel of god call to hagar out of heaven , and say unto she , what aileth thee , hagar ? fear not ; for god have hear the voice of the lad where he be .
arise , lift up the lad , and hold he in thine hand ; for i will make he a great nation .
and god open she eye , and she see a well of water ; and she go , and fill the bottle with water , and give the lad drink .
and god be with the lad ; and he grow , and dwelt in the wilderness , and become a archer .
and he dwell in the wilderness of paran : and he mother take he a wife out of the land of egypt .
and it come to pass at that time , that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of he host spake unto abraham , say , god be with thee in all that thou doest :
now therefore swear unto i here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with i , nor with my son , nor with my son 's son : but accord to the kindness that i have do unto thee , thou shalt do unto i , and to the land wherein thou hast sojourn .
and abraham say , i will swear .
and abraham reprove abimelech because of a well of water , which abimelech 's servant have violently take away .
and abimelech say , i wot not who have do this thing : neither do thou tell i , neither yet hear i of it , but to day .
and abraham take sheep and ox , and give they unto abimelech ; and both of they make a covenant .
and abraham set seven ewe lamb of the flock by themselves .
and abimelech say unto abraham , what mean these seven ewe lamb which thou hast set by themselves ?
and he say , for these seven ewe lamb shalt thou take of my hand , that they may be a witness unto i , that i have dig this well .
wherefore he call that place beersheba ; because there they sware both of they .
thus they make a covenant at beersheba : then abimelech rise up , and phichol the chief captain of he host , and they return into the land of the philistines .
and abraham plant a grove in beersheba , and call there on the name of the lord , the everlasting god .
and abraham sojourn in the philistine ' land many day .
and it come to pass after these thing , that god do tempt abraham , and say unto he , abraham : and he say , behold , here i be .
and he say , take now thy son , thine only son isaac , whom thou lovest , and get thee into the land of moriah ; and offer he there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountain which i will tell thee of .
and abraham rise up early in the morning , and saddle he ass , and take two of he young man with he , and isaac he son , and cleave the wood for the burnt offering , and rise up , and go unto the place of which god have tell he .
then on the third day abraham lift up he eye , and see the place afar off .
and abraham say unto he young man , abide ye here with the ass ; and i and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you .
and abraham take the wood of the burnt offering , and lay it upon isaac he son ; and he take the fire in he hand , and a knife ; and they go both of they together .
and isaac spake unto abraham he father , and say , my father : and he say , here be i , my son .
and he say , behold the fire and the wood : but where be the lamb for a burnt offering ?
and abraham say , my son , god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering : so they go both of they together .
and they come to the place which god have tell he of ; and abraham build a altar there , and lay the wood in order , and bind isaac he son , and lay he on the altar upon the wood .
and abraham stretch forth he hand , and take the knife to slay he son .
and the angel of the lord call unto he out of heaven , and say , abraham , abraham : and he say , here be i.
and he say , lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto he : for now i know that thou fearest god , see thou hast not withhold thy son , thine only son from i .
and abraham lift up he eye , and look , and behold behind he a ram catch in a thicket by he horn : and abraham go and take the ram , and offer he up for a burnt offering in the stead of he son .
and abraham call the name of that place jehovahjireh : as it be say to this day , in the mount of the lord it shall be see .
and the angel of the lord call unto abraham out of heaven the second time ,
and say , by myself have i swear , saith the lord , for because thou hast do this thing , and hast not withhold thy son , thine only son :
that in blessing i will bless thee , and in multiply i will multiply thy seed as the star of the heaven , and as the sand which be upon the sea shore ; and thy seed shall possess the gate of he enemy ;
and in thy seed shall all the nation of the earth be bless ; because thou hast obey my voice .
so abraham return unto he young man , and they rise up and go together to beersheba ; and abraham dwelt at beersheba .
and it come to pass after these thing , that it be tell abraham , say , behold , milcah , she have also bear child unto thy brother nahor ;
huz he firstborn , and buz he brother , and kemuel the father of aram ,
and chesed , and hazo , and pildash , and jidlaph , and bethuel .
and bethuel beget rebekah : these eight milcah do bear to nahor , abraham 's brother .
and he concubine , whose name be reumah , she bare also tebah , and gaham , and thahash , and maachah .
and sarah be a hundred and seven and twenty year old : these be the year of the life of sarah .
and sarah die in kirjatharba ; the same be hebron in the land of canaan : and abraham come to mourn for sarah , and to weep for she .
and abraham stand up from before he dead , and spake unto the son of heth , say ,
i be a stranger and a sojourner with you : give i a possession of a buryingplace with you , that i may bury my dead out of my sight .
and the child of heth answer abraham , say unto he ,
hear we , my lord : thou art a mighty prince among we : in the choice of we sepulchre bury thy dead ; none of we shall withhold from thee he sepulchre , but that thou mayest bury thy dead .
and abraham stand up , and bow himself to the people of the land , even to the child of heth .
and he commune with they , say , if it be you mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear i , and intreat for i to ephron the son of zohar ,
that he may give i the cave of machpelah , which he have , which be in the end of he field ; for as much money as it be worth he shall give it i for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you .
and ephron dwelt among the child of heth : and ephron the hittite answer abraham in the audience of the child of heth , even of all that go in at the gate of he city , say ,
nay , my lord , hear i : the field give i thee , and the cave that be therein , i give it thee ; in the presence of the son of my people give i it thee : bury thy dead .
and abraham bow down himself before the people of the land .
and he speak unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land , say , but if thou wilt give it , i pray thee , hear i : i will give thee money for the field ; take it of i , and i will bury my dead there .
and ephron answer abraham , say unto he ,
my lord , hearken unto i : the land be worth four hundred shekel of silver ; what be that betwixt i and thee ? bury therefore thy dead .
and abraham hearken unto ephron ; and abraham weigh to ephron the silver , which he have name in the audience of the son of heth , four hundred shekel of silver , current money with the merchant .
and the field of ephron , which be in machpelah , which be before mamre , the field , and the cave which be therein , and all the tree that be in the field , that be in all the border round about , be make sure
unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the child of heth , before all that go in at the gate of he city .
and after this , abraham bury sarah he wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre : the same be hebron in the land of canaan .
and the field , and the cave that be therein , be make sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the son of heth .
and abraham be old , and well stricken in age : and the lord have bless abraham in all thing .
and abraham say unto he eldest servant of he house , that rule over all that he have , put , i pray thee , thy hand under my thigh :
and i will make thee swear by the lord , the god of heaven , and the god of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughter of the canaanites , among whom i dwell :
but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son isaac .
and the servant say unto he , peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow i unto this land : must i need bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest ?
and abraham say unto he , beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again .
the lord god of heaven , which take i from my father 's house , and from the land of my kindred , and which speak unto i , and that sware unto i , say , unto thy seed will i give this land ; he shall send he angel before thee , and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence .
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again .
and the servant put he hand under the thigh of abraham he master , and sware to he concern that matter .
and the servant take ten camel of the camel of he master , and depart ; for all the goods of he master be in he hand : and he arise , and go to mesopotamia , unto the city of nahor .
and he make he camel to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that woman go out to draw water .
and he say , o lord god of my master abraham , i pray thee , send i good speed this day , and shew kindness unto my master abraham .
behold , i stand here by the well of water ; and the daughter of the man of the city come out to draw water :
and let it come to pass , that the damsel to whom i shall say , let down thy pitcher , i pray thee , that i may drink ; and she shall say , drink , and i will give thy camel drink also : let the same be she that thou hast appoint for thy servant isaac ; and thereby shall i know that thou hast shew kindness unto my master .
and it come to pass , before he have do speaking , that , behold , rebekah come out , who be bear to bethuel , son of milcah , the wife of nahor , abraham 's brother , with she pitcher upon she shoulder .
and the damsel be very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither have any man know she : and she go down to the well , and fill she pitcher , and come up .
and the servant run to meet she , and say , let i , i pray thee , drink a little water of thy pitcher .
and she say , drink , my lord : and she hast , and let down she pitcher upon she hand , and give he drink .
and when she have do give he drink , she say , i will draw water for thy camel also , until they have do drinking .
and she hast , and empty she pitcher into the trough , and run again unto the well to draw water , and draw for all he camel .
and the man wonder at she hold he peace , to wit whether the lord have make he journey prosperous or not .
and it come to pass , as the camel have do drinking , that the man take a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelet for she hand of ten shekel weight of gold ;
and say , whose daughter art thou ? tell i , i pray thee : be there room in thy father 's house for we to lodge in ?
and she say unto he , i be the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah , which she bare unto nahor .
she say moreover unto he , we have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in .
and the man bow down he head , and worship the lord .
and he say , blessed be the lord god of my master abraham , who have not leave destitute my master of he mercy and he truth : i be in the way , the lord lead i to the house of my master 's brethren .
and the damsel run , and tell they of she mother 's house these thing .
and rebekah have a brother , and he name be laban : and laban run out unto the man , unto the well .
and it come to pass , when he see the earring and bracelet upon he sister 's hand , and when he hear the word of rebekah he sister , say , thus speak the man unto i ; that he come unto the man ; and , behold , he stand by the camel at the well .
and he say , come in , thou bless of the lord ; wherefore standest thou without ? for i have prepare the house , and room for the camel .
and the man come into the house : and he ungird he camel , and give straw and provender for the camel , and water to wash he foot , and the man 's foot that be with he .
and there be set meat before he to eat : but he say , i will not eat , until i have tell mine errand .
and he say , speak on .
and he say , i be abraham 's servant .
and the lord have bless my master greatly ; and he be become great : and he have give he flock , and herd , and silver , and gold , and manservant , and maidservant , and camel , and ass .
and sarah my master 's wife bare a son to my master when she be old : and unto he have he give all that he have .
and my master make i swear , say , thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughter of the canaanites , in whose land i dwell :
but thou shalt go unto my father 's house , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son .
and i say unto my master , peradventure the woman will not follow i .
and he say unto i , the lord , before whom i walk , will send he angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father 's house :
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath , when thou comest to my kindred ; and if they give not thee one , thou shalt be clear from my oath .
and i come this day unto the well , and say , o lord god of my master abraham , if now thou do prosper my way which i go :
behold , i stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water , and i say to she , give i , i pray thee , a little water of thy pitcher to drink ;
and she say to i , both drink thou , and i will also draw for thy camel : let the same be the woman whom the lord have appoint out for my master 's son .
and before i have do speaking in mine heart , behold , rebekah come forth with she pitcher on she shoulder ; and she go down unto the well , and draw water : and i say unto she , let i drink , i pray thee .
and she make haste , and let down she pitcher from she shoulder , and say , drink , and i will give thy camel drink also : so i drink , and she make the camel drink also .
and i ask she , and say , whose daughter art thou ?
and she say , the daughter of bethuel , nahor 's son , whom milcah bare unto he : and i put the earring upon she face , and the bracelet upon she hand .
and i bow down my head , and worship the lord , and bless the lord god of my master abraham , which have lead i in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter unto he son .
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell i : and if not , tell i ; that i may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
then laban and bethuel answer and say , the thing proceedeth from the lord : we can not speak unto thee bad or good .
behold , rebekah be before thee , take she , and go , and let she be thy master 's son 's wife , as the lord have speak .
and it come to pass , that , when abraham 's servant hear they word , he worship the lord , bow himself to the earth .
and the servant bring forth jewel of silver , and jewel of gold , and raiment , and give they to rebekah : he give also to she brother and to she mother precious thing .
and they do eat and drink , he and the man that be with he , and tarry all night ; and they rise up in the morning , and he say , send i away unto my master .
and she brother and she mother say , let the damsel abide with we a few day , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
and he say unto they , hinder i not , see the lord have prosper my way ; send i away that i may go to my master .
and they say , we will call the damsel , and enquire at she mouth .
and they call rebekah , and say unto she , wilt thou go with this man ?
and she say , i will go .
and they send away rebekah they sister , and she nurse , and abraham 's servant , and he man .
and they bless rebekah , and say unto she , thou art we sister , be thou the mother of thousand of million , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate they .
and rebekah arise , and she damsel , and they ride upon the camel , and follow the man : and the servant take rebekah , and go he way .
and isaac come from the way of the well lahairous ; for he dwell in the south country .
and isaac go out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lift up he eye , and see , and , behold , the camel be come .
and rebekah lift up she eye , and when she see isaac , she light off the camel .
for she have say unto the servant , what man be this that walketh in the field to meet we ?
and the servant have say , it be my master : therefore she take a vail , and cover herself .
and the servant tell isaac all thing that he have do .
and isaac bring she into he mother sarah 's tent , and take rebekah , and she become he wife ; and he love she : and isaac be comfort after he mother 's death .
then again abraham take a wife , and she name be keturah .
and she bare he zimran , and jokshan , and medan , and midian , and ishbak , and shuah .
and jokshan beget sheba , and dedan .
and the son of dedan be asshurim , and letushim , and leummim .
and the son of midian ; ephah , and epher , and hanoch , and abidah , and eldaah .
all these be the child of keturah .
and abraham give all that he have unto isaac .
but unto the son of the concubine , which abraham have , abraham give gift , and send they away from isaac he son , while he yet live , eastward , unto the east country .
and these be the day of the year of abraham 's life which he live , a hundred threescore and fifteen year .
then abraham give up the ghost , and die in a good old age , a old man , and full of year ; and be gather to he people .
and he son isaac and ishmael bury he in the cave of machpelah , in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite , which be before mamre ;
the field which abraham purchase of the son of heth : there be abraham bury , and sarah he wife .
and it come to pass after the death of abraham , that god bless he son isaac ; and isaac dwelt by the well lahairous .
now these be the generation of ishmael , abraham 's son , whom hagar the egyptian , sarah 's handmaid , bare unto abraham :
and these be the name of the son of ishmael , by they name , accord to they generation : the firstborn of ishmael , nebajoth ; and kedar , and adbeel , and mibsam ,
and mishma , and dumah , and massa ,
hadar , and tema , jetur , naphish , and kedemah :
these be the son of ishmael , and these be they name , by they town , and by they castle ; twelve prince accord to they nation .
and these be the year of the life of ishmael , a hundred and thirty and seven year : and he give up the ghost and die ; and be gather unto he people .
and they dwell from havilah unto shur , that be before egypt , as thou goest toward assyria : and he die in the presence of all he brethren .
and these be the generation of isaac , abraham 's son : abraham beget isaac :
and isaac be forty year old when he take rebekah to wife , the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram , the sister to laban the syrian .
and isaac intreat the lord for he wife , because she be barren : and the lord be intreat of he , and rebekah he wife conceive .
and the child struggle together within she ; and she say , if it be so , why be i thus ?
and she go to enquire of the lord .
and the lord say unto she , two nation be in thy womb , and two manner of people shall be separate from thy bowels ; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people ; and the elder shall serve the younger .
and when she day to be deliver be fulfil , behold , there be twin in she womb .
and the first come out red , all over like a hairy garment ; and they call he name esau .
and after that come he brother out , and he hand take hold on esau 's heel ; and he name be call jacob : and isaac be threescore year old when she bare they .
and the boy grow : and esau be a cunning hunter , a man of the field ; and jacob be a plain man , dwelling in tent .
and isaac love esau , because he do eat of he venison : but rebekah love jacob .
and jacob sod pottage : and esau come from the field , and he be faint :
and esau say to jacob , feed i , i pray thee , with that same red pottage ; for i be faint : therefore be he name call edom .
and jacob say , sell i this day thy birthright .
and esau say , behold , i be at the point to die : and what profit shall this birthright do to i ?
and jacob say , swear to i this day ; and he sware unto he : and he sell he birthright unto jacob .
then jacob give esau bread and pottage of lentile ; and he do eat and drink , and rise up , and go he way : thus esau despise he birthright .
and there be a famine in the land , beside the first famine that be in the day of abraham .
and isaac go unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar .
and the lord appear unto he , and say , go not down into egypt ; dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of :
sojourn in this land , and i will be with thee , and will bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto thy seed , i will give all these country , and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father ;
and i will make thy seed to multiply as the star of heaven , and will give unto thy seed all these country ; and in thy seed shall all the nation of the earth be bless ;
because that abraham obey my voice , and keep my charge , my commandment , my statute , and my law .
and isaac dwelt in gerar :
and the man of the place ask he of he wife ; and he say , she be my sister : for he fear to say , she be my wife ; lest , say he , the man of the place should kill i for rebekah ; because she be fair to look upon .
and it come to pass , when he have be there a long time , that abimelech king of the philistines look out at a window , and see , and , behold , isaac be sport with rebekah he wife .
and abimelech call isaac , and say , behold , of a surety she be thy wife : and how saidst thou , she be my sister ?
and isaac say unto he , because i say , lest i die for she .
and abimelech say , what be this thou hast do unto we ? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife , and thou shouldest have bring guiltiness upon we .
and abimelech charge all he people , say , he that toucheth this man or he wife shall surely be put to death .
then isaac sow in that land , and receive in the same year a hundredfold : and the lord bless he .
and the man wax great , and go forward , and grow until he become very great :
for he have possession of flock , and possession of herd , and great store of servant : and the philistines envy he .
for all the well which he father 's servant have dig in the day of abraham he father , the philistines have stop they , and fill they with earth .
and abimelech say unto isaac , go from we ; for thou art much mightier than we .
and isaac depart thence , and pitch he tent in the valley of gerar , and dwelt there .
and isaac dig again the well of water , which they have dig in the day of abraham he father ; for the philistines have stop they after the death of abraham : and he call they name after the name by which he father have call they .
and isaac 's servant dig in the valley , and find there a well of spring water .
and the herdman of gerar do strive with isaac 's herdman , say , the water be ours : and he call the name of the well esek ; because they strive with he .
and they dig another well , and strove for that also : and he call the name of it sitnah .
and he remove from thence , and dig another well ; and for that they strive not : and he call the name of it rehoboth ; and he say , for now the lord have make room for we , and we shall be fruitful in the land .
and he go up from thence to beersheba .
and the lord appear unto he the same night , and say , i be the god of abraham thy father : fear not , for i be with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant abraham 's sake .
and he build a altar there , and call upon the name of the lord , and pitch he tent there : and there isaac 's servant dig a well .
then abimelech go to he from gerar , and ahuzzath one of he friend , and phichol the chief captain of he army .
and isaac say unto they , wherefore come ye to i , see ye hate i , and have send i away from you ?
and they say , we see certainly that the lord be with thee : and we say , let there be now a oath betwixt we , even betwixt we and thee , and let we make a covenant with thee ;
that thou wilt do we no hurt , as we have not touch thee , and as we have do unto thee nothing but good , and have send thee away in peace : thou art now the bless of the lord .
and he make they a feast , and they do eat and drink .
and they rise up betime in the morning , and sware one to another : and isaac send they away , and they depart from he in peace .
and it come to pass the same day , that isaac 's servant come , and tell he concern the well which they have dig , and say unto he , we have find water .
and he call it shebah : therefore the name of the city be beersheba unto this day .
and esau be forty year old when he take to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite , and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite :
which be a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah .
and it come to pass , that when isaac be old , and he eye be dim , so that he could not see , he call esau he eldest son , and say unto he , my son : and he say unto he , behold , here be i.
and he say , behold now , i be old , i know not the day of my death :
now therefore take , i pray thee , thy weapon , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take i some venison ;
and make i savoury meat , such as i love , and bring it to i , that i may eat ; that my soul may bless thee before i die .
and rebekah hear when isaac spake to esau he son .
and esau go to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
and rebekah spake unto jacob she son , say , behold , i hear thy father speak unto esau thy brother , say ,
bring i venison , and make i savoury meat , that i may eat , and bless thee before the lord before my death .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice accord to that which i command thee .
go now to the flock , and fetch i from thence two good kid of the goat ; and i will make they savoury meat for thy father , such as he loveth :
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before he death .
and jacob say to rebekah he mother , behold , esau my brother be a hairy man , and i be a smooth man :
my father peradventure will feel i , and i shall seem to he as a deceiver ; and i shall bring a curse upon i , and not a blessing .
and he mother say unto he , upon i be thy curse , my son : only obey my voice , and go fetch i they .
and he go , and fetch , and bring they to he mother : and he mother make savoury meat , such as he father love .
and rebekah take goodly raiment of she eldest son esau , which be with she in the house , and put they upon jacob she younger son :
and she put the skin of the kid of the goat upon he hand , and upon the smooth of he neck :
and she give the savoury meat and the bread , which she have prepare , into the hand of she son jacob .
and he come unto he father , and say , my father : and he say , here be i ; who art thou , my son ?
and jacob say unto he father , i be esau thy first bear ; i have do accord as thou badest i : arise , i pray thee , sit and eat of my venison , that thy soul may bless i .
and isaac say unto he son , how be it that thou hast find it so quickly , my son ?
and he say , because the lord thy god bring it to i .
and isaac say unto jacob , come near , i pray thee , that i may feel thee , my son , whether thou be my very son esau or not .
and jacob go near unto isaac he father ; and he feel he , and say , the voice be jacob 's voice , but the hand be the hand of esau .
and he discern he not , because he hand be hairy , as he brother esau 's hand : so he bless he .
and he say , art thou my very son esau ?
and he say , i be .
and he say , bring it near to i , and i will eat of my son 's venison , that my soul may bless thee .
and he bring it near to he , and he do eat : and he bring he wine , and he drink .
and he father isaac say unto he , come near now , and kiss i , my son .
and he come near , and kiss he : and he smell the smell of he raiment , and bless he , and say , see , the smell of my son be as the smell of a field which the lord have bless :
therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven , and the fatness of the earth , and plenty of corn and wine :
let people serve thee , and nation bow down to thee : be lord over thy brethren , and let thy mother 's son bow down to thee : curse be every one that curseth thee , and bless be he that blesseth thee .
and it come to pass , as soon as isaac have make a end of blessing jacob , and jacob be yet scarce go out from the presence of isaac he father , that esau he brother come in from he hunting .
and he also have make savoury meat , and bring it unto he father , and say unto he father , let my father arise , and eat of he son 's venison , that thy soul may bless i .
and isaac he father say unto he , who art thou ?
and he say , i be thy son , thy firstborn esau .
and isaac tremble very exceedingly , and say , who ? where be he that have take venison , and bring it i , and i have eat of all before thou camest , and have bless he ? yea , and he shall be bless .
and when esau hear the word of he father , he cry with a great and exceed bitter cry , and say unto he father , bless i , even i also , o my father .
and he say , thy brother come with subtilty , and have take away thy blessing .
and he say , be not he rightly name jacob ? for he have supplant i these two time : he take away my birthright ; and , behold , now he have take away my blessing .
and he say , hast thou not reserve a blessing for i ?
and isaac answer and say unto esau , behold , i have make he thy lord , and all he brethren have i give to he for servant ; and with corn and wine have i sustain he : and what shall i do now unto thee , my son ?
and esau say unto he father , hast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless i , even i also , o my father .
and esau lift up he voice , and weep .
and isaac he father answer and say unto he , behold , thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break he yoke from off thy neck .
and esau hate jacob because of the blessing wherewith he father bless he : and esau say in he heart , the day of mourning for my father be at hand ; then will i slay my brother jacob .
and these word of esau she elder son be tell to rebekah : and she send and call jacob she younger son , and say unto he , behold , thy brother esau , as touching thee , doth comfort himself , purpose to kill thee .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to laban my brother to haran ;
and tarry with he a few day , until thy brother 's fury turn away ;
until thy brother 's anger turn away from thee , and he forget that which thou hast do to he : then i will send , and fetch thee from thence : why should i be deprive also of you both in one day ?
and rebekah say to isaac , i be weary of my life because of the daughter of heth : if jacob take a wife of the daughter of heth , such as these which be of the daughter of the land , what good shall my life do i ?
and isaac call jacob , and bless he , and charge he , and say unto he , thou shalt not take a wife of the daughter of canaan .
arise , go to padanaram , to the house of bethuel thy mother 's father ; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughter of laban thy mother 's brother .
and god almighty bless thee , and make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a multitude of people ;
and give thee the blessing of abraham , to thee , and to thy seed with thee ; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger , which god give unto abraham .
and isaac send away jacob : and he go to padanaram unto laban , son of bethuel the syrian , the brother of rebekah , jacob 's and esau 's mother .
when esau see that isaac have bless jacob , and send he away to padanaram , to take he a wife from thence ; and that as he bless he he give he a charge , say , thou shalt not take a wife of the daughter of canaan ;
and that jacob obey he father and he mother , and be go to padanaram ;
and esau see that the daughter of canaan please not isaac he father ;
then go esau unto ishmael , and take unto the wife which he have mahalath the daughter of ishmael abraham 's son , the sister of nebajoth , to be he wife .
and jacob go out from beersheba , and go toward haran .
and he light upon a certain place , and tarry there all night , because the sun be set ; and he take of the stone of that place , and put they for he pillow , and lay down in that place to sleep .
and he dream , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reach to heaven : and behold the angel of god ascend and descend on it .
and , behold , the lord stand above it , and say , i be the lord god of abraham thy father , and the god of isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will i give it , and to thy seed ;
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in thee and in thy seed shall all the family of the earth be bless .
and , behold , i be with thee , and will keep thee in all place whither thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for i will not leave thee , until i have do that which i have speak to thee of .
and jacob awake out of he sleep , and he say , surely the lord be in this place ; and i know it not .
and he be afraid , and say , how dreadful be this place ! this be none other but the house of god , and this be the gate of heaven .
and jacob rise up early in the morning , and take the stone that he have put for he pillow , and set it up for a pillar , and pour oil upon the top of it .
and he call the name of that place bethel : but the name of that city be call luz at the first .
and jacob vow a vow , say , if god will be with i , and will keep i in this way that i go , and will give i bread to eat , and raiment to put on ,
so that i come again to my father 's house in peace ; then shall the lord be my god :
and this stone , which i have set for a pillar , shall be god 's house : and of all that thou shalt give i i will surely give the tenth unto thee .
then jacob go on he journey , and come into the land of the people of the east .
and he look , and behold a well in the field , and , lo , there be three flock of sheep lie by it ; for out of that well they water the flock : and a great stone be upon the well 's mouth .
and thither be all the flock gather : and they roll the stone from the well 's mouth , and water the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in he place .
and jacob say unto they , my brethren , whence be ye ?
and they say , of haran be we .
and he say unto they , know ye laban the son of nahor ?
and they say , we know he .
and he say unto they , be he well ?
and they say , he be well : and , behold , rachel he daughter cometh with the sheep .
and he say , lo , it be yet high day , neither be it time that the cattle should be gather together : water ye the sheep , and go and feed they .
and they say , we can not , until all the flock be gather together , and till they roll the stone from the well 's mouth ; then we water the sheep .
and while he yet speak with they , rachel come with she father 's sheep : for she keep they .
and it come to pass , when jacob see rachel the daughter of laban he mother 's brother , and the sheep of laban he mother 's brother , that jacob go near , and roll the stone from the well 's mouth , and water the flock of laban he mother 's brother .
and jacob kiss rachel , and lift up he voice , and weep .
and jacob tell rachel that he be she father 's brother , and that he be rebekah 's son : and she run and tell she father .
and it come to pass , when laban hear the tiding of jacob he sister 's son , that he run to meet he , and embrace he , and kiss he , and bring he to he house .
and he tell laban all these thing .
and laban say to he , surely thou art my bone and my flesh .
and he abode with he the space of a month .
and laban say unto jacob , because thou art my brother , shouldest thou therefore serve i for nought ? tell i , what shall thy wages be ?
and laban have two daughter : the name of the elder be leah , and the name of the younger be rachel .
leah be tender eye ; but rachel be beautiful and well favoured .
and jacob love rachel ; and say , i will serve thee seven year for rachel thy younger daughter .
and laban say , it be better that i give she to thee , than that i should give she to another man : abide with i .
and jacob serve seven year for rachel ; and they seem unto he but a few day , for the love he have to she .
and jacob say unto laban , give i my wife , for my day be fulfil , that i may go in unto she .
and laban gather together all the man of the place , and make a feast .
and it come to pass in the evening , that he take leah he daughter , and bring she to he ; and he go in unto she .
and laban give unto he daughter leah zilpah he maid for a handmaid .
and it come to pass , that in the morning , behold , it be leah : and he say to laban , what be this thou hast do unto i ? do not i serve with thee for rachel ? wherefore then hast thou beguile i ?
and laban say , it must not be so do in we country , to give the younger before the firstborn .
fulfil she week , and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with i yet seven other year .
and jacob do so , and fulfil she week : and he give he rachel he daughter to wife also .
and laban give to rachel he daughter bilhah he handmaid to be she maid .
and he go in also unto rachel , and he love also rachel more than leah , and serve with he yet seven other year .
and when the lord see that leah be hate , he open she womb : but rachel be barren .
and leah conceive , and bare a son , and she call he name reuben : for she say , surely the lord have look upon my affliction ; now therefore my husband will love i .
and she conceive again , and bare a son ; and say , because the lord have hear that i be hate , he have therefore give i this son also : and she call he name simeon .
and she conceive again , and bare a son ; and say , now this time will my husband be join unto i , because i have bear he three son : therefore be he name call levi .
and she conceive again , and bare a son : and she say , now will i praise the lord : therefore she call he name judah ; and leave bearing .
and when rachel see that she bare jacob no child , rachel envy she sister ; and say unto jacob , give i child , or else i die .
and jacob 's anger be kindle against rachel : and he say , be i in god 's stead , who have withhold from thee the fruit of the womb ?
and she say , behold my maid bilhah , go in unto she ; and she shall bear upon my knee , that i may also have child by she .
and she give he bilhah she handmaid to wife : and jacob go in unto she .
and bilhah conceive , and bare jacob a son .
and rachel say , god have judge i , and have also hear my voice , and have give i a son : therefore call she he name dan .

and zilpah leah 's maid bare jacob a son .
and leah say , a troop cometh : and she call he name gad .
and zilpah leah 's maid bare jacob a second son .
and leah say , happy be i , for the daughter will call i bless : and she call he name asher .
and reuben go in the day of wheat harvest , and find mandrake in the field , and bring they unto he mother leah .
then rachel say to leah , give i , i pray thee , of thy son 's mandrake .
and she say unto she , be it a small matter that thou hast take my husband ? and wouldest thou take away my son 's mandrake also ?
and rachel say , therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son 's mandrake .
and jacob come out of the field in the evening , and leah go out to meet he , and say , thou must come in unto i ; for surely i have hire thee with my son 's mandrake .
and he lay with she that night .
and god hearken unto leah , and she conceive , and bare jacob the fifth son .
and leah say , god have give i my hire , because i have give my maiden to my husband : and she call he name issachar .
and leah conceive again , and bare jacob the sixth son .

and afterwards she bare a daughter , and call she name dinah .
and god remember rachel , and god hearken to she , and open she womb .
and she conceive , and bare a son ; and say , god have take away my reproach :
and she call he name joseph ; and say , the lord shall add to i another son .
and it come to pass , when rachel have bear joseph , that jacob say unto laban , send i away , that i may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
give i my wife and my child , for whom i have serve thee , and let i go : for thou knowest my service which i have do thee .
and laban say unto he , i pray thee , if i have find favour in thine eye , tarry : for i have learn by experience that the lord have bless i for thy sake .
and he say , appoint i thy wages , and i will give it .
and he say unto he , thou knowest how i have serve thee , and how thy cattle be with i .
for it be little which thou hadst before i come , and it be now increase unto a multitude ; and the lord have bless thee since my come : and now when shall i provide for mine own house also ?
and he say , what shall i give thee ?
and jacob say , thou shalt not give i any thing : if thou wilt do this thing for i , i will again feed and keep thy flock .
i will pass through all thy flock to day , remove from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle , and all the brown cattle among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goat : and of such shall be my hire .
so shall my righteousness answer for i in time to come , when it shall come for my hire before thy face : every one that be not speckled and spot among the goat , and brown among the sheep , that shall be count steal with i .
and laban say , behold , i would it might be accord to thy word .
and he remove that day the he goat that be ringstraked and spotted , and all the she goat that be speckled and spotted , and every one that have some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and give they into the hand of he son .
and he set three day ' journey betwixt himself and jacob : and jacob feed the rest of laban 's flock .
and jacob take he rod of green poplar , and of the hazel and chestnut tree ; and pill white strake in they , and make the white appear which be in the rod .
and he set the rod which he have pill before the flock in the gutter in the water trough when the flock come to drink , that they should conceive when they come to drink .
and the flock conceive before the rod , and bring forth cattle ringstrake , speckled , and spot .
and jacob do separate the lamb , and set the face of the flock toward the ringstraked , and all the brown in the flock of laban ; and he put he own flock by themselves , and put they not unto laban 's cattle .
and it come to pass , whensoever the stronger cattle do conceive , that jacob lay the rod before the eye of the cattle in the gutter , that they might conceive among the rod .
but when the cattle be feeble , he put they not in : so the feebler be laban 's , and the stronger jacob 's .
and the man increase exceedingly , and have much cattle , and maidservant , and manservant , and camel , and ass .
and he hear the word of laban 's son , say , jacob have take away all that be we father 's ; and of that which be we father 's have he get all this glory .
and jacob behold the countenance of laban , and , behold , it be not toward he as before .
and the lord say unto jacob , return unto the land of thy father , and to thy kindred ; and i will be with thee .
and jacob send and call rachel and leah to the field unto he flock ,
and say unto they , i see you father 's countenance , that it be not toward i as before ; but the god of my father have be with i .
and ye know that with all my power i have serve you father .
and you father have deceive i , and change my wages ten time ; but god suffer he not to hurt i .
if he say thus , the speckled shall be thy wages ; then all the cattle bare speckled : and if he say thus , the ringstraked shall be thy hire ; then bare all the cattle ringstrake .
thus god have take away the cattle of you father , and give they to i .
and it come to pass at the time that the cattle conceive , that i lift up mine eye , and see in a dream , and , behold , the ram which leap upon the cattle be ringstraked , speckled , and grisle .
and the angel of god speak unto i in a dream , say , jacob : and i say , here be i.
and he say , lift up now thine eye , and see , all the ram which leap upon the cattle be ringstraked , speckled , and grisle : for i have see all that laban doeth unto thee .
i be the god of bethel , where thou anointedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow unto i : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kindred .
and rachel and leah answer and say unto he , be there yet any portion or inheritance for we in we father 's house ?
be we not count of he stranger ? for he have sell we , and have quite devour also we money .
for all the riches which god have take from we father , that be ours , and we child 's : now then , whatsoever god have say unto thee , do .
then jacob rise up , and set he son and he wife upon camel ;
and he carry away all he cattle , and all he goods which he have get , the cattle of he get , which he have get in padanaram , for to go to isaac he father in the land of canaan .
and laban go to shear he sheep : and rachel have steal the image that be she father 's .
and jacob steal away unawares to laban the syrian , in that he tell he not that he flee .
so he flee with all that he have ; and he rise up , and pass over the river , and set he face toward the mount gilead .
and it be tell laban on the third day that jacob be flee .
and he take he brethren with he , and pursue after he seven day ' journey ; and they overtake he in the mount gilead .
and god come to laban the syrian in a dream by night , and say unto he , take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad .
then laban overtook jacob .
now jacob have pitch he tent in the mount : and laban with he brethren pitch in the mount of gilead .
and laban say to jacob , what hast thou do , that thou hast steal away unaware to i , and carry away my daughter , as captive take with the sword ?
wherefore didst thou flee away secretly , and steal away from i ; and do not tell i , that i might have send thee away with mirth , and with song , with tabret , and with harp ?
and hast not suffer i to kiss my son and my daughter ? thou hast now do foolishly in so do .
it be in the power of my hand to do you hurt : but the god of you father speak unto i yesternight , say , take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad .
and now , though thou wouldest need be go , because thou sore longedst after thy father 's house , yet wherefore hast thou steal my god ?
and jacob answer and say to laban , because i be afraid : for i say , peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughter from i .
with whomsoever thou findest thy god , let he not live : before we brethren discern thou what be thine with i , and take it to thee .
for jacob know not that rachel have steal they .
and laban go into jacob 's tent , and into leah 's tent , and into the two maidservant ' tent ; but he find they not .
then go he out of leah 's tent , and enter into rachel 's tent .
now rachel have take the image , and put they in the camel 's furniture , and sit upon they .
and laban search all the tent , but find they not .
and she say to she father , let it not displease my lord that i can not rise up before thee ; for the custom of woman be upon i .
and he search , but find not the image .
and jacob be wroth , and chode with laban : and jacob answer and say to laban , what be my trespass ? what be my sin , that thou hast so hotly pursue after i ?
whereas thou hast search all my stuff , what hast thou find of all thy household stuff ? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren , that they may judge betwixt we both .
this twenty year have i be with thee ; thy ewe and thy she goat have not cast they young , and the ram of thy flock have i not eat .
that which be tear of beast i bring not unto thee ; i bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether steal by day , or steal by night .
thus i be ; in the day the drought consume i , and the frost by night ; and my sleep depart from mine eye .
thus have i be twenty year in thy house ; i serve thee fourteen year for thy two daughter , and six year for thy cattle : and thou hast change my wages ten time .
except the god of my father , the god of abraham , and the fear of isaac , have be with i , surely thou hadst send i away now empty .
god have see mine affliction and the labour of my hand , and rebuke thee yesternight .
and laban answer and say unto jacob , these daughter be my daughter , and these child be my child , and these cattle be my cattle , and all that thou seest be mine : and what can i do this day unto these my daughter , or unto they child which they have bear ?
now therefore come thou , let we make a covenant , i and thou ; and let it be for a witness between i and thee .
and jacob take a stone , and set it up for a pillar .
and jacob say unto he brethren , gather stone ; and they take stone , and make a heap : and they do eat there upon the heap .
and laban call it jegarsahadutha : but jacob call it galeed .
and laban say , this heap be a witness between i and thee this day .
therefore be the name of it call galeed ;
and mizpah ; for he say , the lord watch between i and thee , when we be absent one from another .
if thou shalt afflict my daughter , or if thou shalt take other wife beside my daughter , no man be with we ; see , god be witness betwixt i and thee .
and laban say to jacob , behold this heap , and behold this pillar , which i have cast betwixt i and thee :
this heap be witness , and this pillar be witness , that i will not pass over this heap to thee , and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto i , for harm .
the god of abraham , and the god of nahor , the god of they father , judge betwixt we .
and jacob sware by the fear of he father isaac .
then jacob offer sacrifice upon the mount , and call he brethren to eat bread : and they do eat bread , and tarry all night in the mount .
and early in the morning laban rise up , and kiss he son and he daughter , and bless they : and laban depart , and return unto he place .
and jacob go on he way , and the angel of god meet he .
and when jacob see they , he say , this be god 's host : and he call the name of that place mahanaim .
and jacob send messenger before he to esau he brother unto the land of seir , the country of edom .
and he command they , say , thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau ; thy servant jacob saith thus , i have sojourn with laban , and stay there until now :
and i have oxen , and ass , flock , and manservant , and womenservant : and i have send to tell my lord , that i may find grace in thy sight .
and the messenger return to jacob , say , we come to thy brother esau , and also he cometh to meet thee , and four hundred man with he .
then jacob be greatly afraid and distressed : and he divide the people that be with he , and the flock , and herd , and the camel , into two band ;
and say , if esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the other company which be leave shall escape .
and jacob say , o god of my father abraham , and god of my father isaac , the lord which saidst unto i , return unto thy country , and to thy kindred , and i will deal well with thee :
i be not worthy of the least of all the mercy , and of all the truth , which thou hast shew unto thy servant ; for with my staff i pass over this jordan ; and now i be become two band .
deliver i , i pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of esau : for i fear he , lest he will come and smite i , and the mother with the child .
and thou saidst , i will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which can not be number for multitude .
and he lodge there that same night ; and take of that which come to he hand a present for esau he brother ;
two hundred she goat , and twenty he goat , two hundred ewe , and twenty ram ,
thirty milch camel with they colt , forty kine , and ten bull , twenty she ass , and ten foal .
and he deliver they into the hand of he servant , every drive by themselves ; and say unto he servant , pass over before i , and put a space betwixt drive and drive .
and he command the foremost , say , when esau my brother meeteth thee , and asketh thee , say , whose art thou ? and whither goest thou ? and whose be these before thee ?
then thou shalt say , they be thy servant jacob 's ; it be a present send unto my lord esau : and , behold , also he be behind we .
and so command he the second , and the third , and all that follow the drove , say , on this manner shall ye speak unto esau , when ye find he .
and say ye moreover , behold , thy servant jacob be behind we .
for he say , i will appease he with the present that goeth before i , and afterward i will see he face ; peradventure he will accept of i .
so go the present over before he : and himself lodge that night in the company .
and he rise up that night , and take he two wife , and he two womenservant , and he eleven son , and pass over the ford jabbok .
and he take they , and send they over the brook , and send over that he have .
and jacob be leave alone ; and there wrestle a man with he until the breaking of the day .
and when he see that he prevail not against he , he touch the hollow of he thigh ; and the hollow of jacob 's thigh be out of joint , as he wrestle with he .
and he say , let i go , for the day breaketh .
and he say , i will not let thee go , except thou bless i .
and he say unto he , what be thy name ?
and he say , jacob .
and he say , thy name shall be call no more jacob , but israel : for as a prince hast thou power with god and with man , and hast prevail .
and jacob ask he , and say , tell i , i pray thee , thy name .
and he say , wherefore be it that thou dost ask after my name ?
and he bless he there .
and jacob call the name of the place peniel : for i have see god face to face , and my life be preserve .
and as he pass over penuel the sun rise upon he , and he halt upon he thigh .
therefore the child of israel eat not of the sinew which shrink , which be upon the hollow of the thigh , unto this day : because he touch the hollow of jacob 's thigh in the sinew that shrink .
and jacob lift up he eye , and look , and , behold , esau come , and with he four hundred man .
and he divide the child unto leah , and unto rachel , and unto the two handmaid .
and he put the handmaid and they child foremost , and leah and she child after , and rachel and joseph hindermost .
and he pass over before they , and bow himself to the ground seven time , until he come near to he brother .
and esau run to meet he , and embrace he , and fall on he neck , and kiss he : and they weep .
and he lift up he eye , and see the woman and the child ; and say , who be those with thee ?
and he say , the child which god have graciously give thy servant .
then the handmaiden come near , they and they child , and they bow themselves .
and leah also with she child come near , and bow themselves : and after come joseph near and rachel , and they bow themselves .
and he say , what meanest thou by all this drive which i meet ?
and he say , these be to find grace in the sight of my lord .
and esau say , i have enough , my brother ; keep that thou hast unto thyself .
and jacob say , nay , i pray thee , if now i have find grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore i have see thy face , as though i have see the face of god , and thou wast please with i .
take , i pray thee , my blessing that be bring to thee ; because god have deal graciously with i , and because i have enough .
and he urge he , and he take it .
and he say , let we take we journey , and let we go , and i will go before thee .
and he say unto he , my lord knoweth that the child be tender , and the flock and herd with young be with i : and if man should overdrive they one day , all the flock will die .
let my lord , i pray thee , pass over before he servant : and i will lead on softly , accord as the cattle that goeth before i and the child be able to endure , until i come unto my lord unto seir .
and esau say , let i now leave with thee some of the folk that be with i .
and he say , what needeth it ? let i find grace in the sight of my lord .
so esau return that day on he way unto seir .
and jacob journey to succoth , and build he a house , and make booth for he cattle : therefore the name of the place be call succoth .
and jacob come to shalem , a city of shechem , which be in the land of canaan , when he come from padanaram ; and pitch he tent before the city .
and he buy a parcel of a field , where he have spread he tent , at the hand of the child of hamor , shechem 's father , for a hundred piece of money .
and he erect there a altar , and call it eleloheisrael .
and dinah the daughter of leah , which she bare unto jacob , go out to see the daughter of the land .
and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite , prince of the country , see she , he take she , and lay with she , and defile she .
and he soul cleave unto dinah the daughter of jacob , and he love the damsel , and spake kindly unto the damsel .
and shechem speak unto he father hamor , say , get i this damsel to wife .
and jacob hear that he have defile dinah he daughter : now he son be with he cattle in the field : and jacob hold he peace until they be come .
and hamor the father of shechem go out unto jacob to commune with he .
and the son of jacob come out of the field when they hear it : and the man be grieve , and they be very wroth , because he have work folly in israel in lie with jacob 's daughter ; which thing ought not to be do .
and hamor commune with they , say , the soul of my son shechem longeth for you daughter : i pray you give she he to wife .
and make ye marriage with we , and give you daughter unto we , and take we daughter unto you .
and ye shall dwell with we : and the land shall be before you ; dwell and trade ye therein , and get you possession therein .
and shechem say unto she father and unto she brethren , let i find grace in you eye , and what ye shall say unto i i will give .
ask i never so much dowry and gift , and i will give accord as ye shall say unto i : but give i the damsel to wife .
and the son of jacob answer shechem and hamor he father deceitfully , and say , because he have defile dinah they sister :
and they say unto they , we can not do this thing , to give we sister to one that be uncircumcised ; for that be a reproach unto we :
but in this will we consent unto you : if ye will be as we be , that every male of you be circumcise ;
then will we give we daughter unto you , and we will take you daughter to we , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if ye will not hearken unto we , to be circumcise ; then will we take we daughter , and we will be go .
and they word pleased hamor , and shechem hamor 's son .
and the young man defer not to do the thing , because he have delight in jacob 's daughter : and he be more honourable than all the house of he father .
and hamor and shechem he son come unto the gate of they city , and commune with the man of they city , say ,
these man be peaceable with we ; therefore let they dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it be large enough for they ; let we take they daughter to we for wife , and let we give they we daughter .
only herein will the man consent unto we for to dwell with we , to be one people , if every male among we be circumcise , as they be circumcise .
shall not they cattle and they substance and every beast of theirs be ours ? only let we consent unto they , and they will dwell with we .
and unto hamor and unto shechem he son hearken all that go out of the gate of he city ; and every male be circumcise , all that go out of the gate of he city .
and it come to pass on the third day , when they be sore , that two of the son of jacob , simeon and levi , dinah 's brethren , take each man he sword , and come upon the city boldly , and slew all the male .
and they slew hamor and shechem he son with the edge of the sword , and take dinah out of shechem 's house , and go out .
the son of jacob come upon the slay , and spoil the city , because they have defile they sister .
they take they sheep , and they ox , and they ass , and that which be in the city , and that which be in the field ,
and all they wealth , and all they little one , and they wife take they captive , and spoil even all that be in the house .
and jacob say to simeon and levi , ye have trouble i to make i to stink among the inhabitant of the land , among the canaanites and the perizzites : and i be few in number , they shall gather themselves together against i , and slay i ; and i shall be destroy , i and my house .
and they say , should he deal with we sister as with a harlot ?
and god say unto jacob , arise , go up to bethel , and dwell there : and make there a altar unto god , that appear unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother .
then jacob say unto he household , and to all that be with he , put away the strange god that be among you , and be clean , and change you garment :
and let we arise , and go up to bethel ; and i will make there a altar unto god , who answer i in the day of my distress , and be with i in the way which i go .
and they give unto jacob all the strange god which be in they hand , and all they earring which be in they ear ; and jacob hide they under the oak which be by shechem .
and they journey : and the terror of god be upon the city that be round about they , and they do not pursue after the son of jacob .
so jacob come to luz , which be in the land of canaan , that be , bethel , he and all the people that be with he .
and he build there a altar , and call the place elbethel : because there god appear unto he , when he flee from the face of he brother .
but deborah rebekah 's nurse die , and she be bury beneath bethel under a oak : and the name of it be call allonbachuth .
and god appear unto jacob again , when he come out of padanaram , and bless he .
and god say unto he , thy name be jacob : thy name shall not be call any more jacob , but israel shall be thy name : and he call he name israel .
and god say unto he , i be god almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nation shall be of thee , and king shall come out of thy loin ;
and the land which i give abraham and isaac , to thee i will give it , and to thy seed after thee will i give the land .
and god go up from he in the place where he talk with he .
and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talk with he , even a pillar of stone : and he pour a drink offering thereon , and he pour oil thereon .
and jacob call the name of the place where god spake with he , bethel .
and they journey from bethel ; and there be but a little way to come to ephrath : and rachel travail , and she have hard labour .
and it come to pass , when she be in hard labour , that the midwife say unto she , fear not ; thou shalt have this son also .
and it come to pass , as she soul be in depart , ( for she die ) that she call he name benoni : but he father call he benjamin .
and rachel die , and be bury in the way to ephrath , which be bethlehem .
and jacob set a pillar upon she grave : that be the pillar of rachel 's grave unto this day .
and israel journey , and spread he tent beyond the tower of edar .
and it come to pass , when israel dwelt in that land , that reuben go and lay with bilhah he father 's concubine : and israel hear it .

joseph , be seventeen year old , be feed the flock with he brethren ; and the lad be with the son of bilhah , and with the son of zilpah , he father 's wife : and joseph bring unto he father they evil report .
now israel love joseph more than all he child , because he be the son of he old age : and he make he a coat of many colour .
and when he brethren see that they father love he more than all he brethren , they hate he , and could not speak peaceably unto he .
and joseph dream a dream , and he tell it he brethren : and they hate he yet the more .
and he say unto they , hear , i pray you , this dream which i have dream :
for , behold , we be bind sheaf in the field , and , lo , my sheaf arise , and also stand upright ; and , behold , you sheaf stand round about , and make obeisance to my sheaf .
and he brethren say to he , shalt thou indeed reign over we ? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over we ?
and they hate he yet the more for he dream , and for he word .
and he dream yet another dream , and tell it he brethren , and say , behold , i have dream a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven star make obeisance to i .
and he tell it to he father , and to he brethren : and he father rebuke he , and say unto he , what be this dream that thou hast dream ?
shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth ?
and he brethren envy he ; but he father observe the say .
and he brethren go to feed they father 's flock in shechem .
and israel say unto joseph , do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem ? come , and i will send thee unto they .
and he say to he , here be i.
and he say to he , go , i pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren , and well with the flock ; and bring i word again .
so he send he out of the vale of hebron , and he come to shechem .
and a certain man find he , and , behold , he be wander in the field : and the man ask he , say , what seekest thou ?
and he say , i seek my brethren : tell i , i pray thee , where they feed they flock .
and the man say , they be depart hence ; for i hear they say , let we go to dothan .
and joseph go after he brethren , and find they in dothan .
and when they see he afar off , even before he come near unto they , they conspire against he to slay he .
and they say one to another , behold , this dreamer cometh .
come now therefore , and let we slay he , and cast he into some pit , and we will say , some evil beast have devour he : and we shall see what will become of he dream .
and reuben hear it , and he deliver he out of they hand ; and say , let we not kill he .
and reuben say unto they , shed no blood , but cast he into this pit that be in the wilderness , and lay no hand upon he ; that he might rid he out of they hand , to deliver he to he father again .
and it come to pass , when joseph be come unto he brethren , that they stript joseph out of he coat , he coat of many colour that be on he ;
and they take he , and cast he into a pit : and the pit be empty , there be no water in it .
and they sit down to eat bread : and they lift up they eye and look , and , behold , a company of ishmeelites come from gilead with they camel bear spicery and balm and myrrh , go to carry it down to egypt .
and judah say unto he brethren , what profit be it if we slay we brother , and conceal he blood ?
come , and let we sell he to the ishmeelites , and let not we hand be upon he ; for he be we brother and we flesh .
and he brethren be content .
then there pass by midianites merchantman ; and they draw and lift up joseph out of the pit , and sell joseph to the ishmeelites for twenty piece of silver : and they bring joseph into egypt .
and reuben return unto the pit ; and , behold , joseph be not in the pit ; and he rent he clothes .
and he return unto he brethren , and say , the child be not ; and i , whither shall i go ?
and they take joseph 's coat , and kill a kid of the goat , and dip the coat in the blood ;
and they send the coat of many colour , and they bring it to they father ; and say , this have we find : know now whether it be thy son 's coat or no. .
and he know it , and say , it be my son 's coat ; a evil beast have devour he ; joseph be without doubt rent in piece .
and jacob rent he clothes , and put sackcloth upon he loin , and mourn for he son many day .
and all he son and all he daughter rise up to comfort he ; but he refuse to be comfort ; and he say , for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning .
thus he father weep for he .
and the midianites sell he into egypt unto potiphar , a officer of pharaoh 's , and captain of the guard .
and it come to pass at that time , that judah go down from he brethren , and turn in to a certain adullamite , whose name be hirah .
and judah see there a daughter of a certain canaanite , whose name be shuah ; and he take she , and go in unto she .
and she conceive , and bare a son ; and he call he name er .
and she conceive again , and bare a son ; and she call he name onan .
and she yet again conceive , and bare a son ; and call he name shelah : and he be at chezib , when she bare he .
and judah take a wife for er he firstborn , whose name be tamar .
and er , judah 's firstborn , be wicked in the sight of the lord ; and the lord slew he .
and judah say unto onan , go in unto thy brother 's wife , and marry she , and raise up seed to thy brother .
and onan know that the seed should not be he ; and it come to pass , when he go in unto he brother 's wife , that he spill it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to he brother .
and the thing which he do displeased the lord : wherefore he slew he also .
then say judah to tamar he daughter in law , remain a widow at thy father 's house , till shelah my son be grow : for he say , lest peradventure he die also , as he brethren do .
and tamar go and dwelt in she father 's house .
and in process of time the daughter of shuah judah 's wife die ; and judah be comfort , and go up unto he sheepshearer to timnath , he and he friend hirah the adullamite .
and it be tell tamar , say , behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear he sheep .
and she put she widow 's garment off from she , and cover she with a vail , and wrap herself , and sit in a open place , which be by the way to timnath ; for she see that shelah be grow , and she be not give unto he to wife .
when judah see she , he think she to be a harlot ; because she have cover she face .
and he turn unto she by the way , and say , go to , i pray thee , let i come in unto thee ; ( for he know not that she be he daughter in law . )
and she say , what wilt thou give i , that thou mayest come in unto i ?
and he say , i will send thee a kid from the flock .
and she say , wilt thou give i a pledge , till thou send it ?
and he say , what pledge shall i give thee ?
and she say , thy signet , and thy bracelet , and thy staff that be in thine hand .
and he give it she , and come in unto she , and she conceive by he .
and she arise , and go away , and lay by she vail from she , and put on the garment of she widowhood .
and judah send the kid by the hand of he friend the adullamite , to receive he pledge from the woman 's hand : but he find she not .
then he ask the man of that place , say , where be the harlot , that be openly by the way side ?
and they say , there be no harlot in this place .
and he return to judah , and say , i can not find she ; and also the man of the place say , that there be no harlot in this place .
and judah say , let she take it to she , lest we be shame : behold , i send this kid , and thou hast not find she .
and it come to pass about three month after , that it be tell judah , say , tamar thy daughter in law have play the harlot ; and also , behold , she be with child by whoredom .
and judah say , bring she forth , and let she be burn .
when she be bring forth , she send to she father in law , say , by the man , whose these be , be i with child : and she say , discern , i pray thee , whose be these , the signet , and bracelet , and staff .
and judah acknowledge they , and say , she have be more righteous than i ; because that i give she not to shelah my son .
and he know she again no more .
and it come to pass in the time of she travail , that , behold , twin be in she womb .
and it come to pass , when she travail , that the one put out he hand : and the midwife take and bind upon he hand a scarlet thread , say , this come out first .
and it come to pass , as he draw back he hand , that , behold , he brother come out : and she say , how hast thou break forth ? this breach be upon thee : therefore he name be call pharez .
and afterward come out he brother , that have the scarlet thread upon he hand : and he name be call zarah .
and joseph be bring down to egypt ; and potiphar , a officer of pharaoh , captain of the guard , a egyptian , buy he of the hand of the ishmeelites , which have bring he down thither .
and the lord be with joseph , and he be a prosperous man ; and he be in the house of he master the egyptian .
and he master see that the lord be with he , and that the lord make all that he do to prosper in he hand .
and joseph find grace in he sight , and he serve he : and he make he overseer over he house , and all that he have he put into he hand .
and it come to pass from the time that he have make he overseer in he house , and over all that he have , that the lord bless the egyptian 's house for joseph 's sake ; and the blessing of the lord be upon all that he have in the house , and in the field .
and he leave all that he have in joseph 's hand ; and he know not ought he have , save the bread which he do eat .
and joseph be a goodly person , and well favoured .
and it come to pass after these thing , that he master 's wife cast she eye upon joseph ; and she say , lie with i .
but he refuse , and say unto he master 's wife , behold , my master wotteth not what be with i in the house , and he have commit all that he have to my hand ;
there be none greater in this house than i ; neither have he keep back any thing from i but thee , because thou art he wife : how then can i do this great wickedness , and sin against god ?
and it come to pass , as she speak to joseph day by day , that he hearken not unto she , to lie by she , or to be with she .
and it come to pass about this time , that joseph go into the house to do he business ; and there be none of the man of the house there within .
and she catch he by he garment , say , lie with i : and he leave he garment in she hand , and flee , and get he out .
and it come to pass , when she see that he have leave he garment in she hand , and be flee forth ,
that she call unto the man of she house , and spake unto they , say , see , he have bring in a hebrew unto we to mock we ; he come in unto i to lie with i , and i cry with a loud voice :
and it come to pass , when he hear that i lift up my voice and cry , that he leave he garment with i , and flee , and get he out .
and she lay up he garment by she , until he lord come home .
and she speak unto he accord to these word , say , the hebrew servant , which thou hast bring unto we , come in unto i to mock i :
and it come to pass , as i lift up my voice and cry , that he leave he garment with i , and flee out .
and it come to pass , when he master hear the word of he wife , which she speak unto he , say , after this manner do thy servant to i ; that he wrath be kindle .
and joseph 's master take he , and put he into the prison , a place where the king 's prisoner be bind : and he be there in the prison .
but the lord be with joseph , and shew he mercy , and give he favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
and the keeper of the prison commit to joseph 's hand all the prisoner that be in the prison ; and whatsoever they do there , he be the doer of it .
the keeper of the prison look not to any thing that be under he hand ; because the lord be with he , and that which he do , the lord make it to prosper .
and it come to pass after these thing , that the butler of the king of egypt and he baker have offend they lord the king of egypt .
and pharaoh be wroth against two of he officer , against the chief of the butler , and against the chief of the baker .
and he put they in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where joseph be bind .
and the captain of the guard charge joseph with they , and he serve they : and they continue a season in ward .
and they dream a dream both of they , each man he dream in one night , each man accord to the interpretation of he dream , the butler and the baker of the king of egypt , which be bind in the prison .
and joseph come in unto they in the morning , and look upon they , and , behold , they be sad .
and he ask pharaoh 's officer that be with he in the ward of he lord 's house , say , wherefore look ye so sadly to day ?
and they say unto he , we have dream a dream , and there be no interpreter of it .
and joseph say unto they , do not interpretation belong to god ? tell i they , i pray you .
and the chief butler tell he dream to joseph , and say to he , in my dream , behold , a vine be before i ;
and in the vine be three branch : and it be as though it bud , and she blossom shoot forth ; and the cluster thereof bring forth ripe grape :
and pharaoh 's cup be in my hand : and i take the grape , and press they into pharaoh 's cup , and i give the cup into pharaoh 's hand .
and joseph say unto he , this be the interpretation of it : the three branch be three day :
yet within three day shall pharaoh lift up thine head , and restore thee unto thy place : and thou shalt deliver pharaoh 's cup into he hand , after the former manner when thou wast he butler .
but think on i when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , i pray thee , unto i , and make mention of i unto pharaoh , and bring i out of this house :
for indeed i be steal away out of the land of the hebrews : and here also have i do nothing that they should put i into the dungeon .
when the chief baker see that the interpretation be good , he say unto joseph , i also be in my dream , and , behold , i have three white basket on my head :
and in the uppermost basket there be of all manner of bakemeat for pharaoh ; and the bird do eat they out of the basket upon my head .
and joseph answer and say , this be the interpretation thereof : the three basket be three day :
yet within three day shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the bird shall eat thy flesh from off thee .
and it come to pass the third day , which be pharaoh 's birthday , that he make a feast unto all he servant : and he lift up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among he servant .
and he restore the chief butler unto he butlership again ; and he give the cup into pharaoh 's hand :
but he hang the chief baker : as joseph have interpret to they .
yet do not the chief butler remember joseph , but forgat he .
and it come to pass at the end of two full year , that pharaoh dream : and , behold , he stand by the river .
and , behold , there come up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatflesh ; and they feed in a meadow .
and , behold , seven other kine come up after they out of the river , ill favoured and leanflesh ; and stand by the other kine upon the brink of the river .
and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine do eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine .
so pharaoh awake .
and he sleep and dream the second time : and , behold , seven ear of corn come up upon one stalk , rank and good .
and , behold , seven thin ear and blast with the east wind spring up after they .
and the seven thin ear devour the seven rank and full ear .
and pharaoh awake , and , behold , it be a dream .
and it come to pass in the morning that he spirit be trouble ; and he send and call for all the magician of egypt , and all the wise man thereof : and pharaoh tell they he dream ; but there be none that could interpret they unto pharaoh .
then speak the chief butler unto pharaoh , say , i do remember my fault this day :
pharaoh be wroth with he servant , and put i in ward in the captain of the guard 's house , both i and the chief baker :
and we dream a dream in one night , i and he ; we dream each man accord to the interpretation of he dream .
and there be there with we a young man , a hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard ; and we tell he , and he interpret to we we dream ; to each man accord to he dream he do interpret .
and it come to pass , as he interpret to we , so it be ; i he restore unto mine office , and he he hang .
then pharaoh send and call joseph , and they bring he hastily out of the dungeon : and he shave himself , and change he raiment , and come in unto pharaoh .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , i have dream a dream , and there be none that can interpret it : and i have hear say of thee , that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it .
and joseph answer pharaoh , say , it be not in i : god shall give pharaoh a answer of peace .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , in my dream , behold , i stand upon the bank of the river :
and , behold , there come up out of the river seven kine , fatfleshed and well favour ; and they feed in a meadow :
and , behold , seven other kine come up after they , poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed , such as i never see in all the land of egypt for badness :
and the lean and the ill favoured kine do eat up the first seven fat kine :
and when they have eat they up , it could not be know that they have eat they ; but they be still ill favoured , as at the beginning .
so i awake .
and i see in my dream , and , behold , seven ear come up in one stalk , full and good :
and , behold , seven ear , wither , thin , and blast with the east wind , spring up after they :
and the thin ear devour the seven good ear : and i tell this unto the magician ; but there be none that could declare it to i .
and joseph say unto pharaoh , the dream of pharaoh be one : god have shewed pharaoh what he be about to do .
the seven good kine be seven year ; and the seven good ear be seven year : the dream be one .
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that come up after they be seven year ; and the seven empty ear blast with the east wind shall be seven year of famine .
this be the thing which i have speak unto pharaoh : what god be about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh .
behold , there come seven year of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt :
and there shall arise after they seven year of famine ; and all the plenty shall be forget in the land of egypt ; and the famine shall consume the land ;
and the plenty shall not be know in the land by reason of that famine follow ; for it shall be very grievous .
and for that the dream be double unto pharaoh twice ; it be because the thing be establish by god , and god will shortly bring it to pass .
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise , and set he over the land of egypt .
let pharaoh do this , and let he appoint officer over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous year .
and let they gather all the food of those good year that come , and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh , and let they keep food in the city .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven year of famine , which shall be in the land of egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
and the thing be good in the eye of pharaoh , and in the eye of all he servant .
and pharaoh say unto he servant , can we find such a one as this be , a man in whom the spirit of god be ?
and pharaoh say unto joseph , forasmuch as god have shewed thee all this , there be none so discreet and wise as thou art :
thou shalt be over my house , and accord unto thy word shall all my people be rule : only in the throne will i be greater than thou .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , see , i have set thee over all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh take off he ring from he hand , and put it upon joseph 's hand , and array he in vesture of fine linen , and put a gold chain about he neck ;
and he make he to ride in the second chariot which he have ; and they cry before he , bow the knee : and he make he ruler over all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , i be pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift up he hand or foot in all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh call joseph 's name zaphnathpaaneah ; and he give he to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on .
and joseph go out over all the land of egypt .
and joseph be thirty year old when he stand before pharaoh king of egypt .
and joseph go out from the presence of pharaoh , and go throughout all the land of egypt .
and in the seven plenteous year the earth bring forth by handful .
and he gather up all the food of the seven year , which be in the land of egypt , and lay up the food in the city : the food of the field , which be round about every city , lay he up in the same .
and joseph gather corn as the sand of the sea , very much , until he leave numbering ; for it be without number .
and unto joseph be bear two son before the year of famine come , which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto he .
and joseph call the name of the firstborn manasseh : for god , say he , have make i forget all my toil , and all my father 's house .
and the name of the second call he ephraim : for god have cause i to be fruitful in the land of my affliction .
and the seven year of plenteousness , that be in the land of egypt , be end .
and the seven year of dearth begin to come , accord as joseph have say : and the dearth be in all land ; but in all the land of egypt there be bread .
and when all the land of egypt be famish , the people cry to pharaoh for bread : and pharaoh say unto all the egyptians , go unto joseph ; what he saith to you , do .
and the famine be over all the face of the earth : and joseph open all the storehouse , and sell unto the egyptians ; and the famine wax sore in the land of egypt .
and all country come into egypt to joseph for to buy corn ; because that the famine be so sore in all land .
now when jacob see that there be corn in egypt , jacob say unto he son , why do ye look one upon another ?
and he say , behold , i have hear that there be corn in egypt : get you down thither , and buy for we from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
and joseph 's ten brethren go down to buy corn in egypt .
but benjamin , joseph 's brother , jacob send not with he brethren ; for he say , lest peradventure mischief befall he .
and the son of israel come to buy corn among those that come : for the famine be in the land of canaan .
and joseph be the governor over the land , and he it be that sell to all the people of the land : and joseph 's brethren come , and bow down themselves before he with they face to the earth .
and joseph see he brethren , and he know they , but make himself strange unto they , and spake roughly unto they ; and he say unto they , whence come ye ?
and they say , from the land of canaan to buy food .
and joseph know he brethren , but they know not he .
and joseph remember the dream which he dream of they , and say unto they , ye be spy ; to see the nakedness of the land ye be come .
and they say unto he , nay , my lord , but to buy food be thy servant come .
we be all one man 's son ; we be true man , thy servant be no spy .
and he say unto they , nay , but to see the nakedness of the land ye be come .
and they say , thy servant be twelve brethren , the son of one man in the land of canaan ; and , behold , the youngest be this day with we father , and one be not .
and joseph say unto they , that be it that i speak unto you , say , ye be spy :
hereby ye shall be prove : by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence , except you youngest brother come hither .
send one of you , and let he fetch you brother , and ye shall be keep in prison , that you word may be prove , whether there be any truth in you : or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye be spy .
and he put they all together into ward three day .
and joseph say unto they the third day , this do , and live ; for i fear god :
if ye be true man , let one of you brethren be bind in the house of you prison : go ye , carry corn for the famine of you house :
but bring you youngest brother unto i ; so shall you word be verify , and ye shall not die .
and they do so .
and they say one to another , we be verily guilty concern we brother , in that we see the anguish of he soul , when he beseech we , and we would not hear ; therefore be this distress come upon we .
and reuben answer they , say , spake i not unto you , say , do not sin against the child ; and ye would not hear ? therefore , behold , also he blood be require .
and they know not that joseph understand they ; for he speak unto they by a interpreter .
and he turn himself about from they , and weep ; and return to they again , and commune with they , and take from they simeon , and bind he before they eye .
then joseph command to fill they sack with corn , and to restore every man 's money into he sack , and to give they provision for the way : and thus do he unto they .
and they lade they ass with the corn , and depart thence .
and as one of they open he sack to give he ass provender in the inn , he espy he money ; for , behold , it be in he sack 's mouth .
and he say unto he brethren , my money be restore ; and , lo , it be even in my sack : and they heart fail they , and they be afraid , say one to another , what be this that god have do unto we ?
and they come unto jacob they father unto the land of canaan , and tell he all that befall unto they ; say ,
the man , who be the lord of the land , spake roughly to we , and take we for spy of the country .
and we say unto he , we be true man ; we be no spy :
we be twelve brethren , son of we father ; one be not , and the youngest be this day with we father in the land of canaan .
and the man , the lord of the country , say unto we , hereby shall i know that ye be true man ; leave one of you brethren here with i , and take food for the famine of you household , and be go :
and bring you youngest brother unto i : then shall i know that ye be no spy , but that ye be true man : so will i deliver you you brother , and ye shall traffick in the land .
and it come to pass as they empty they sack , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money be in he sack : and when both they and they father see the bundle of money , they be afraid .
and jacob they father say unto they , i have ye bereaved of my child : joseph be not , and simeon be not , and ye will take benjamin away : all these thing be against i .
and reuben spake unto he father , say , slay my two son , if i bring he not to thee : deliver he into my hand , and i will bring he to thee again .
and he say , my son shall not go down with you ; for he brother be dead , and he be leave alone : if mischief befall he by the way in the which ye go , then shall ye bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave .
and the famine be sore in the land .
and it come to pass , when they have eat up the corn which they have bring out of egypt , they father say unto they , go again , buy we a little food .
and judah spake unto he , say , the man do solemnly protest unto we , say , ye shall not see my face , except you brother be with you .
if thou wilt send we brother with we , we will go down and buy thee food :
but if thou wilt not send he , we will not go down : for the man say unto we , ye shall not see my face , except you brother be with you .
and israel say , wherefore deal ye so ill with i , as to tell the man whether ye have yet a brother ?
and they say , the man ask we straitly of we state , and of we kindred , say , be you father yet alive ? have ye another brother ? and we tell he accord to the tenor of these word : could we certainly know that he would say , bring you brother down ?
and judah say unto israel he father , send the lad with i , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and thou , and also we little one .
i will be surety for he ; of my hand shalt thou require he : if i bring he not unto thee , and set he before thee , then let i bear the blame for ever :
for except we have linger , surely now we have return this second time .
and they father israel say unto they , if it must be so now , do this ; take of the best fruit in the land in you vessel , and carry down the man a present , a little balm , and a little honey , spice , and myrrh , nut , and almond :
and take double money in you hand ; and the money that be bring again in the mouth of you sack , carry it again in you hand ; peradventure it be a oversight :
take also you brother , and arise , go again unto the man :
and god almighty give you mercy before the man , that he may send away you other brother , and benjamin .
if i be bereave of my child , i be bereaved .
and the man take that present , and they take double money in they hand , and benjamin ; and rise up , and go down to egypt , and stand before joseph .
and when joseph see benjamin with they , he say to the ruler of he house , bring these man home , and slay , and make ready ; for these man shall dine with i at noon .
and the man do as joseph bid ; and the man bring the man into joseph 's house .
and the man be afraid , because they be bring into joseph 's house ; and they say , because of the money that be return in we sack at the first time be we bring in ; that he may seek occasion against we , and fall upon we , and take we for bondman , and we ass .
and they come near to the steward of joseph 's house , and they commune with he at the door of the house ,
and say , o sir , we come indeed down at the first time to buy food :
and it come to pass , when we come to the inn , that we open we sack , and , behold , every man 's money be in the mouth of he sack , we money in full weight : and we have bring it again in we hand .
and other money have we bring down in we hand to buy food : we can not tell who put we money in we sack .
and he say , peace be to you , fear not : you god , and the god of you father , have give you treasure in you sack : i have you money .
and he bring simeon out unto they .
and the man bring the man into joseph 's house , and give they water , and they wash they foot ; and he give they ass provender .
and they make ready the present against joseph come at noon : for they hear that they should eat bread there .
and when joseph come home , they bring he the present which be in they hand into the house , and bow themselves to he to the earth .
and he ask they of they welfare , and say , be you father well , the old man of whom ye spake ?
be he yet alive ?
and they answer , thy servant we father be in good health , he be yet alive .
and they bow down they head , and make obeisance .
and he lift up he eye , and see he brother benjamin , he mother 's son , and say , be this you younger brother , of whom ye spake unto i ?
and he say , god be gracious unto thee , my son .
and joseph make haste ; for he bowels do yearn upon he brother : and he seek where to weep ; and he enter into he chamber , and weep there .
and he wash he face , and go out , and refrain himself , and say , set on bread .
and they set on for he by himself , and for they by themselves , and for the egyptians , which do eat with he , by themselves : because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews ; for that be a abomination unto the egyptians .
and they sit before he , the firstborn accord to he birthright , and the youngest accord to he youth : and the man marvel one at another .
and he take and send mess unto they from before he : but benjamin 's mess be five time so much as any of theirs .
and they drink , and be merry with he .
and he command the steward of he house , say , fill the man 's sack with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man 's money in he sack 's mouth .
and put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack 's mouth of the youngest , and he corn money .
and he do accord to the word that joseph have speak .
as soon as the morning be light , the man be send away , they and they ass .
and when they be go out of the city , and not yet far off , joseph say unto he steward , up , follow after the man ; and when thou dost overtake they , say unto they , wherefore have ye reward evil for good ?
be not this it in which my lord drinketh , and whereby indeed he divineth ? ye have do evil in so do .
and he overtake they , and he speak unto they these same word .
and they say unto he , wherefore saith my lord these word ?
god forbid that thy servant should do accord to this thing :
behold , the money , which we find in we sack ' mouth , we bring again unto thee out of the land of canaan : how then should we steal out of thy lord 's house silver or gold ?
with whomsoever of thy servant it be find , both let he die , and we also will be my lord 's bondman .
and he say , now also let it be accord unto you word : he with whom it be find shall be my servant ; and ye shall be blameless .
then they speedily take down every man he sack to the ground , and open every man he sack .
and he search , and begin at the eldest , and leave at the youngest : and the cup be find in benjamin 's sack .
then they rent they clothes , and laded every man he ass , and return to the city .
and judah and he brethren come to joseph 's house ; for he be yet there : and they fall before he on the ground .
and joseph say unto they , what deed be this that ye have do ? wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine ?
and judah say , what shall we say unto my lord ? what shall we speak ? or how shall we clear ourselves ?
god have find out the iniquity of thy servant : behold , we be my lord 's servant , both we , and he also with whom the cup be find .
and he say , god forbid that i should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup be find , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto you father .
then judah come near unto he , and say , oh my lord , let thy servant , i pray thee , speak a word in my lord 's ear , and let not thine anger burn against thy servant : for thou art even as pharaoh .
my lord ask he servant , say , have ye a father , or a brother ?
and we say unto my lord , we have a father , a old man , and a child of he old age , a little one ; and he brother be dead , and he alone be leave of he mother , and he father loveth he .
and thou saidst unto thy servant , bring he down unto i , that i may set mine eye upon he .
and we say unto my lord , the lad can not leave he father : for if he should leave he father , he father would die .
and thou saidst unto thy servant , except you youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more .
and it come to pass when we come up unto thy servant my father , we tell he the word of my lord .
and we father say , go again , and buy we a little food .
and we say , we can not go down : if we youngest brother be with we , then will we go down : for we may not see the man 's face , except we youngest brother be with we .
and thy servant my father say unto we , ye know that my wife bare i two son :
and the one go out from i , and i say , surely he be tear in piece ; and i see he not since :
and if ye take this also from i , and mischief befall he , ye shall bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave .
now therefore when i come to thy servant my father , and the lad be not with we ; see that he life be bind up in the lad 's life ;
it shall come to pass , when he seeth that the lad be not with we , that he will die : and thy servant shall bring down the gray hair of thy servant we father with sorrow to the grave .
for thy servant become surety for the lad unto my father , say , if i bring he not unto thee , then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever .
now therefore , i pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with he brethren .
for how shall i go up to my father , and the lad be not with i ? lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father .
then joseph could not refrain himself before all they that stand by he ; and he cry , cause every man to go out from i .
and there stand no man with he , while joseph make himself known unto he brethren .
and he weep aloud : and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh hear .
and joseph say unto he brethren , i be joseph ; doth my father yet live ?
and he brethren could not answer he ; for they be trouble at he presence .
and joseph say unto he brethren , come near to i , i pray you .
and they come near .
and he say , i be joseph you brother , whom ye sell into egypt .
now therefore be not grieve , nor angry with yourselve , that ye sell i hither : for god do send i before you to preserve life .
for these two year have the famine be in the land : and yet there be five year , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
and god send i before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth , and to save you life by a great deliverance .
so now it be not you that send i hither , but god : and he have make i a father to pharaoh , and lord of all he house , and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt .
haste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto he , thus saith thy son joseph , god have make i lord of all egypt : come down unto i , tarry not :
and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen , and thou shalt be near unto i , thou , and thy child , and thy child 's child , and thy flock , and thy herd , and all that thou hast :
and there will i nourish thee ; for yet there be five year of famine ; lest thou , and thy household , and all that thou hast , come to poverty .
and , behold , you eye see , and the eye of my brother benjamin , that it be my mouth that speaketh unto you .
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt , and of all that ye have see ; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither .
and he fall upon he brother benjamin 's neck , and weep ; and benjamin weep upon he neck .
moreover he kiss all he brethren , and weep upon they : and after that he brethren talk with he .
and the fame thereof be hear in pharaoh 's house , say , joseph 's brethren be come : and it pleased pharaoh well , and he servant .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , say unto thy brethren , this do ye ; lade you beast , and go , get you unto the land of canaan ;
and take you father and you household , and come unto i : and i will give you the good of the land of egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
now thou art command , this do ye ; take you wagon out of the land of egypt for you little one , and for you wife , and bring you father , and come .
also regard not you stuff ; for the good of all the land of egypt be yours .
and the child of israel do so : and joseph give they wagon , accord to the commandment of pharaoh , and give they provision for the way .
to all of they he give each man change of raiment ; but to benjamin he give three hundred piece of silver , and five change of raiment .
and to he father he send after this manner ; ten ass laden with the good thing of egypt , and ten she ass laden with corn and bread and meat for he father by the way .
so he send he brethren away , and they depart : and he say unto they , see that ye fall not out by the way .
and they go up out of egypt , and come into the land of canaan unto jacob they father ,
and tell he , say , joseph be yet alive , and he be governor over all the land of egypt .
and jacob 's heart faint , for he believe they not .
and they tell he all the word of joseph , which he have say unto they : and when he see the wagon which joseph have send to carry he , the spirit of jacob they father revive :
and israel say , it be enough ; joseph my son be yet alive : i will go and see he before i die .
and israel take he journey with all that he have , and come to beersheba , and offer sacrifice unto the god of he father isaac .
and god speak unto israel in the vision of the night , and say , jacob , jacob .
and he say , here be i.
and he say , i be god , the god of thy father : fear not to go down into egypt ; for i will there make of thee a great nation :
i will go down with thee into egypt ; and i will also surely bring thee up again : and joseph shall put he hand upon thine eye .
and jacob rise up from beersheba : and the son of israel carry jacob they father , and they little one , and they wife , in the wagon which pharaoh have send to carry he .
and they take they cattle , and they goods , which they have get in the land of canaan , and come into egypt , jacob , and all he seed with he :
he son , and he son ' son with he , he daughter , and he son ' daughter , and all he seed bring he with he into egypt .
and these be the name of the child of israel , which come into egypt , jacob and he son : reuben , jacob 's firstborn .

and the son of issachar ; tola , and phuvah , and job , and shimron .
and the son of zebulun ; sered , and elon , and jahleel .
these be the son of leah , which she bare unto jacob in padanaram , with he daughter dinah : all the soul of he son and he daughter be thirty and three .
and the son of gad ; ziphion , and haggi , shuni , and ezbon , eri , and arodi , and areli .
and the son of asher ; jimnah , and ishuah , and isui , and beriah , and serah they sister : and the son of beriah ; heber , and malchiel .
these be the son of zilpah , whom laban give to leah he daughter , and these she bare unto jacob , even sixteen soul .

and the son of joseph , which be bear he in egypt , be two soul : all the soul of the house of jacob , which come into egypt , be threescore and ten .
and he send judah before he unto joseph , to direct he face unto goshen ; and they come into the land of goshen .
and joseph make ready he chariot , and go up to meet israel he father , to goshen , and present himself unto he ; and he fall on he neck , and weep on he neck a good while .
and israel say unto joseph , now let i die , since i have see thy face , because thou art yet alive .
and joseph say unto he brethren , and unto he father 's house , i will go up , and shew pharaoh , and say unto he , my brethren , and my father 's house , which be in the land of canaan , be come unto i ;
and the man be shepherd , for they trade have be to feed cattle ; and they have bring they flock , and they herd , and all that they have .
and it shall come to pass , when pharaoh shall call you , and shall say , what be you occupation ?
that ye shall say , thy servant ' trade have be about cattle from we youth even until now , both we , and also we father : that ye may dwell in the land of goshen ; for every shepherd be a abomination unto the egyptians .
then joseph come and tell pharaoh , and say , my father and my brethren , and they flock , and they herd , and all that they have , be come out of the land of canaan ; and , behold , they be in the land of goshen .
and he take some of he brethren , even five man , and present they unto pharaoh .
and pharaoh say unto he brethren , what be you occupation ?
and they say unto pharaoh , thy servant be shepherd , both we , and also we father .
they say moreover unto pharaoh , for to sojourn in the land be we come ; for thy servant have no pasture for they flock ; for the famine be sore in the land of canaan : now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servant dwell in the land of goshen .
and pharaoh speak unto joseph , say , thy father and thy brethren be come unto thee :
the land of egypt be before thee ; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell ; in the land of goshen let they dwell : and if thou knowest any man of activity among they , then make they ruler over my cattle .
and joseph bring in jacob he father , and set he before pharaoh : and jacob bless pharaoh .
and pharaoh say unto jacob , how old art thou ?
and jacob say unto pharaoh , the day of the year of my pilgrimage be a hundred and thirty year : few and evil have the day of the year of my life be , and have not attain unto the day of the year of the life of my father in the day of they pilgrimage .
and jacob bless pharaoh , and go out from before pharaoh .
and joseph place he father and he brethren , and give they a possession in the land of egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of rameses , as pharaoh have command .
and joseph nourish he father , and he brethren , and all he father 's household , with bread , accord to they family .
and there be no bread in all the land ; for the famine be very sore , so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan faint by reason of the famine .
and joseph gather up all the money that be find in the land of egypt , and in the land of canaan , for the corn which they buy : and joseph bring the money into pharaoh 's house .
and when money fail in the land of egypt , and in the land of canaan , all the egyptians come unto joseph , and say , give we bread : for why should we die in thy presence ? for the money faileth .
and joseph say , give you cattle ; and i will give you for you cattle , if money fail .
and they bring they cattle unto joseph : and joseph give they bread in exchange for horse , and for the flock , and for the cattle of the herd , and for the ass : and he feed they with bread for all they cattle for that year .
when that year be end , they come unto he the second year , and say unto he , we will not hide it from my lord , how that we money be spend ; my lord also have we herd of cattle ; there be not ought left in the sight of my lord , but we body , and we land :
wherefore shall we die before thine eye , both we and we land ? buy we and we land for bread , and we and we land will be servant unto pharaoh : and give we seed , that we may live , and not die , that the land be not desolate .
and joseph buy all the land of egypt for pharaoh ; for the egyptians sell every man he field , because the famine prevail over they : so the land become pharaoh 's .
and as for the people , he remove they to city from one end of the border of egypt even to the other end thereof .
only the land of the priest buy he not ; for the priest have a portion assign they of pharaoh , and do eat they portion which pharaoh give they : wherefore they sell not they land .
then joseph say unto the people , behold , i have buy you this day and you land for pharaoh : lo , here be seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
and it shall come to pass in the increase , that ye shall give the fifth part unto pharaoh , and four part shall be you own , for seed of the field , and for you food , and for they of you household , and for food for you little one .
and they say , thou hast save we life : let we find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be pharaoh 's servant .
and joseph make it a law over the land of egypt unto this day , that pharaoh should have the fifth part ; except the land of the priest only , which become not pharaoh 's .
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt , in the country of goshen ; and they have possession therein , and grow , and multiply exceedingly .
and jacob live in the land of egypt seventeen year : so the whole age of jacob be a hundred forty and seven year .
and the time draw nigh that israel must die : and he call he son joseph , and say unto he , if now i have find grace in thy sight , put , i pray thee , thy hand under my thigh , and deal kindly and truly with i ; bury i not , i pray thee , in egypt :
but i will lie with my father , and thou shalt carry i out of egypt , and bury i in they buryingplace .
and he say , i will do as thou hast say .
and he say , swear unto i .
and he sware unto he .
and israel bow himself upon the bed 's head .
and it come to pass after these thing , that one tell joseph , behold , thy father be sick : and he take with he he two son , manasseh and ephraim .
and one tell jacob , and say , behold , thy son joseph cometh unto thee : and israel strengthen himself , and sit upon the bed .
and jacob say unto joseph , god almighty appear unto i at luz in the land of canaan , and bless i ,
and say unto i , behold , i will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and i will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for a everlasting possession .
and now thy two son , ephraim and manasseh , which be bear unto thee in the land of egypt before i come unto thee into egypt , be mine ; as reuben and simeon , they shall be mine .
and thy issue , which thou begettest after they , shall be thine , and shall be call after the name of they brethren in they inheritance .
and as for i , when i come from padan , rachel die by i in the land of canaan in the way , when yet there be but a little way to come unto ephrath : and i bury she there in the way of ephrath ; the same be bethlehem .
and israel behold joseph 's son , and say , who be these ?
and joseph say unto he father , they be my son , whom god have give i in this place .
and he say , bring they , i pray thee , unto i , and i will bless they .
now the eye of israel be dim for age , so that he could not see .
and he bring they near unto he ; and he kiss they , and embrace they .
and israel say unto joseph , i have not think to see thy face : and , lo , god have shew i also thy seed .
and joseph bring they out from between he knee , and he bow himself with he face to the earth .
and joseph take they both , ephraim in he right hand toward israel 's left hand , and manasseh in he left hand toward israel 's right hand , and bring they near unto he .
and israel stretch out he right hand , and lay it upon ephraim 's head , who be the younger , and he left hand upon manasseh 's head , guide he hand wittingly ; for manasseh be the firstborn .
and he bless joseph , and say , god , before whom my father abraham and isaac do walk , the god which feed i all my life long unto this day ,
the angel which redeem i from all evil , bless the lad ; and let my name be name on they , and the name of my father abraham and isaac ; and let they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
and when joseph see that he father lay he right hand upon the head of ephraim , it displeased he : and he hold up he father 's hand , to remove it from ephraim 's head unto manasseh 's head .
and joseph say unto he father , not so , my father : for this be the firstborn ; put thy right hand upon he head .
and he father refuse , and say , i know it , my son , i know it : he also shall become a people , and he also shall be great : but truly he younger brother shall be greater than he , and he seed shall become a multitude of nation .
and he bless they that day , say , in thee shall israel bless , say , god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh : and he set ephraim before manasseh .
and israel say unto joseph , behold , i die : but god shall be with you , and bring you again unto the land of you father .
moreover i have give to thee one portion above thy brethren , which i take out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow .
and jacob call unto he son , and say , gather yourselve together , that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last day .
gather yourselve together , and hear , ye son of jacob ; and hearken unto israel you father .
reuben , thou art my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity , and the excellency of power :
unstable as water , thou shalt not excel ; because thou wentest up to thy father 's bed ; then defiledst thou it : he go up to my couch .
simeon and levi be brethren ; instrument of cruelty be in they habitation .
o my soul , come not thou into they secret ; unto they assembly , mine honour , be not thou unite : for in they anger they slew a man , and in they selfwill they dig down a wall .
curse be they anger , for it be fierce ; and they wrath , for it be cruel : i will divide they in jacob , and scatter they in israel .
judah , thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise : thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemy ; thy father 's child shall bow down before thee .
judah be a lion 's whelp : from the prey , my son , thou art go up : he stoop down , he couch as a lion , and as a old lion ; who shall rouse he up ?
the sceptre shall not depart from judah , nor a lawgiver from between he foot , until shiloh come ; and unto he shall the gathering of the people be .
bind he foal unto the vine , and he ass 's colt unto the choice vine ; he wash he garment in wine , and he clothes in the blood of grape :
he eye shall be red with wine , and he tooth white with milk .
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ; and he shall be for a haven of ship ; and he border shall be unto zidon .
issachar be a strong ass couch down between two burden :
and he see that rest be good , and the land that it be pleasant ; and bow he shoulder to bear , and become a servant unto tribute .
dan shall judge he people , as one of the tribe of israel .
dan shall be a serpent by the way , a adder in the path , that biteth the horse heel , so that he rider shall fall backward .
i have wait for thy salvation , o lord .
gad , a troop shall overcome he : but he shall overcome at the last .
out of asher he bread shall be fat , and he shall yield royal dainty .
naphtali be a hind let loose : he giveth goodly word .
joseph be a fruitful bough , even a fruitful bough by a well ; whose branch run over the wall :
the archer have sorely grieve he , and shot at he , and hate he :
but he bow abode in strength , and the arm of he hand be make strong by the hand of the mighty god of jacob ; ( from thence be the shepherd , the stone of israel : )
even by the god of thy father , who shall help thee ; and by the almighty , who shall bless thee with blessing of heaven above , blessing of the deep that lieth under , blessing of the breast , and of the womb :
the blessing of thy father have prevail above the blessing of my progenitor unto the utmost bind of the everlasting hill : they shall be on the head of joseph , and on the crown of the head of he that be separate from he brethren .
benjamin shall ravin as a wolf : in the morning he shall devour the prey , and at night he shall divide the spoil .
all these be the twelve tribe of israel : and this be it that they father spake unto they , and bless they ; every one accord to he blessing he bless they .
and he charge they , and say unto they , i be to be gather unto my people : bury i with my father in the cave that be in the field of ephron the hittite ,
in the cave that be in the field of machpelah , which be before mamre , in the land of canaan , which abraham buy with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace .
there they bury abraham and sarah he wife ; there they bury isaac and rebekah he wife ; and there i bury leah .
the purchase of the field and of the cave that be therein be from the child of heth .
and when jacob have make a end of command he son , he gather up he foot into the bed , and yield up the ghost , and be gather unto he people .
and joseph fall upon he father 's face , and weep upon he , and kiss he .
and joseph command he servant the physician to embalm he father : and the physician embalm israel .
and forty day be fulfil for he ; for so be fulfil the day of those which be embalm : and the egyptians mourn for he threescore and ten day .
and when the day of he mourning be past , joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh , say , if now i have find grace in you eye , speak , i pray you , in the ear of pharaoh , say ,
my father make i swear , say , lo , i die : in my grave which i have dig for i in the land of canaan , there shalt thou bury i .
now therefore let i go up , i pray thee , and bury my father , and i will come again .
and pharaoh say , go up , and bury thy father , accord as he make thee swear .
and joseph go up to bury he father : and with he go up all the servant of pharaoh , the elder of he house , and all the elder of the land of egypt ,
and all the house of joseph , and he brethren , and he father 's house : only they little one , and they flock , and they herd , they leave in the land of goshen .
and there go up with he both chariot and horseman : and it be a very great company .
and they come to the threshingfloor of atad , which be beyond jordan , and there they mourn with a great and very sore lamentation : and he make a mourning for he father seven day .
and when the inhabitant of the land , the canaanites , see the mourning in the floor of atad , they say , this be a grievous mourning to the egyptians : wherefore the name of it be call abelmizraim , which be beyond jordan .
and he son do unto he accord as he command they :
for he son carry he into the land of canaan , and bury he in the cave of the field of machpelah , which abraham buy with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite , before mamre .
and joseph return into egypt , he , and he brethren , and all that go up with he to bury he father , after he have bury he father .
and when joseph 's brethren see that they father be dead , they say , joseph will peradventure hate we , and will certainly requite we all the evil which we do unto he .
and they send a messenger unto joseph , say , thy father do command before he die , say ,
so shall ye say unto joseph , forgive , i pray thee now , the trespass of thy brethren , and they sin ; for they do unto thee evil : and now , we pray thee , forgive the trespass of the servant of the god of thy father .
and joseph weep when they speak unto he .
and he brethren also go and fall down before he face ; and they say , behold , we be thy servant .
and joseph say unto they , fear not : for be i in the place of god ?
but as for you , ye think evil against i ; but god mean it unto good , to bring to pass , as it be this day , to save much people alive .
now therefore fear ye not : i will nourish you , and you little one .
and he comfort they , and spake kindly unto they .
and joseph dwelt in egypt , he , and he father 's house : and joseph live a hundred and ten year .
and joseph see ephraim 's child of the third generation : the child also of machir the son of manasseh be bring up upon joseph 's knee .
and joseph say unto he brethren , i die : and god will surely visit you , and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob .
and joseph take a oath of the child of israel , say , god will surely visit you , and ye shall carry up my bone from hence .
so joseph die , be a hundred and ten year old : and they embalm he , and he be put in a coffin in egypt .
now these be the name of the child of israel , which come into egypt ; every man and he household come with jacob .
reuben , simeon , levi , and judah ,
issachar , zebulun , and benjamin ,
dan , and naphtali , gad , and asher .
and all the soul that come out of the loin of jacob be seventy soul : for joseph be in egypt already .
and joseph die , and all he brethren , and all that generation .
and the child of israel be fruitful , and increase abundantly , and multiply , and wax exceed mighty ; and the land be fill with they .
now there arise up a new king over egypt , which know not joseph .
and he say unto he people , behold , the people of the child of israel be more and mightier than we :
come on , let we deal wisely with they ; lest they multiply , and it come to pass , that , when there falleth out any war , they join also unto we enemy , and fight against we , and so get they up out of the land .
therefore they do set over they taskmaster to afflict they with they burden .
and they build for pharaoh treasure city , pithom and raamses .
but the more they afflict they , the more they multiply and grow .
and they be grieve because of the child of israel .
and the egyptians make the child of israel to serve with rigour :
and they make they life bitter with hard bondage , in morter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all they service , wherein they make they serve , be with rigour .
and the king of egypt speak to the hebrew midwife , of which the name of the one be shiphrah , and the name of the other puah :
and he say , when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew woman , and see they upon the stool ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill he : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
but the midwife fear god , and do not as the king of egypt command they , but save the man child alive .
and the king of egypt call for the midwife , and say unto they , why have ye do this thing , and have save the man child alive ?
and the midwife say unto pharaoh , because the hebrew woman be not as the egyptian woman ; for they be lively , and be deliver ere the midwife come in unto they .
therefore god deal well with the midwife : and the people multiply , and wax very mighty .
and it come to pass , because the midwife fear god , that he make they house .
and pharaoh charge all he people , say , every son that be bear ye shall cast into the river , and every daughter ye shall save alive .
and there go a man of the house of levi , and take to wife a daughter of levi .
and the woman conceive , and bare a son : and when she see he that he be a goodly child , she hide he three month .
and when she could not longer hide he , she take for he a ark of bulrush , and daub it with slime and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she lay it in the flag by the river 's brink .
and he sister stand afar off , to wit what would be do to he .
and the daughter of pharaoh come down to wash herself at the river ; and she maiden walk along by the river 's side ; and when she see the ark among the flag , she send she maid to fetch it .
and when she have open it , she see the child : and , behold , the babe weep .
and she have compassion on he , and say , this be one of the hebrews ' child .
then say he sister to pharaoh 's daughter , shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew woman , that she may nurse the child for thee ?
and pharaoh 's daughter say to she , go .
and the maid go and call the child 's mother .
and pharaoh 's daughter say unto she , take this child away , and nurse it for i , and i will give thee thy wages .
and the woman take the child , and nurse it .
and the child grow , and she bring he unto pharaoh 's daughter , and he become she son .
and she call he name mose : and she say , because i draw he out of the water .
and it come to pass in those day , when moses be grow , that he go out unto he brethren , and look on they burden : and he spy a egyptian smite a hebrew , one of he brethren .
and he look this way and that way , and when he see that there be no man , he slew the egyptian , and hide he in the sand .
and when he go out the second day , behold , two man of the hebrews strive together : and he say to he that do the wrong , wherefore smitest thou thy fellow ?
and he say , who make thee a prince and a judge over we ? intendest thou to kill i , as thou killedst the egyptian ?
and moses fear , and say , surely this thing be know .
now when pharaoh hear this thing , he seek to slay moses .
but moses flee from the face of pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of midian : and he sit down by a well .
now the priest of midian have seven daughter : and they come and draw water , and fill the trough to water they father 's flock .
and the shepherd come and drive they away : but moses stand up and help they , and water they flock .
and when they come to reuel they father , he say , how be it that ye be come so soon to day ?
and they say , a egyptian deliver we out of the hand of the shepherd , and also draw water enough for we , and water the flock .
and he say unto he daughter , and where be he ? why be it that ye have leave the man ? call he , that he may eat bread .
and moses be content to dwell with the man : and he give moses zipporah he daughter .
and she bare he a son , and he call he name gershom : for he say , i have be a stranger in a strange land .
and it come to pass in process of time , that the king of egypt die : and the child of israel sigh by reason of the bondage , and they cry , and they cry come up unto god by reason of the bondage .
and god hear they groaning , and god remember he covenant with abraham , with isaac , and with jacob .
and god look upon the child of israel , and god have respect unto they .
now mose keep the flock of jethro he father in law , the priest of midian : and he lead the flock to the backside of the desert , and come to the mountain of god , even to horeb .
and the angel of the lord appear unto he in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he look , and , behold , the bush burn with fire , and the bush be not consume .
and moses say , i will now turn aside , and see this great sight , why the bush be not burnt .
and when the lord see that he turn aside to see , god call unto he out of the midst of the bush , and say , moses , moses .
and he say , here be i.
and he say , draw not nigh hither : put off thy shoe from off thy foot , for the place whereon thou standest be holy ground .
moreover he say , i be the god of thy father , the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob .
and moses hide he face ; for he be afraid to look upon god .
and the lord say , i have surely see the affliction of my people which be in egypt , and have hear they cry by reason of they taskmaster ; for i know they sorrow ;
and i be come down to deliver they out of the hand of the egyptians , and to bring they up out of that land unto a good land and a large , unto a land flow with milk and honey ; unto the place of the canaanites , and the hittites , and the amorites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites .
now therefore , behold , the cry of the child of israel be come unto i : and i have also see the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress they .
come now therefore , and i will send thee unto pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the child of israel out of egypt .
and moses say unto god , who be i , that i should go unto pharaoh , and that i should bring forth the child of israel out of egypt ?
and he say , certainly i will be with thee ; and this shall be a token unto thee , that i have send thee : when thou hast bring forth the people out of egypt , ye shall serve god upon this mountain .
and moses say unto god , behold , when i come unto the child of israel , and shall say unto they , the god of you father have send i unto you ; and they shall say to i , what be he name ? what shall i say unto they ?
and god say unto mose , i be that i be : and he say , thus shalt thou say unto the child of israel , i be have send i unto you .
and god say moreover unto mose , thus shalt thou say unto the child of israel , the lord god of you father , the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob , have send i unto you : this be my name for ever , and this be my memorial unto all generation .
go , and gather the elder of israel together , and say unto they , the lord god of you father , the god of abraham , of isaac , and of jacob , appear unto i , say , i have surely visit you , and see that which be do to you in egypt :
and i have say , i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites , and the hittites , and the amorites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , unto a land flow with milk and honey .
and they shall hearken to thy voice : and thou shalt come , thou and the elder of israel , unto the king of egypt , and ye shall say unto he , the lord god of the hebrews have meet with we : and now let we go , we beseech thee , three day ' journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to the lord we god .
and i be sure that the king of egypt will not let you go , no , not by a mighty hand .
and i will stretch out my hand , and smite egypt with all my wonder which i will do in the midst thereof : and after that he will let you go .
and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
but every woman shall borrow of she neighbour , and of she that sojourneth in she house , jewel of silver , and jewel of gold , and raiment : and ye shall put they upon you son , and upon you daughter ; and ye shall spoil the egyptians .
and mose answer and say , but , behold , they will not believe i , nor hearken unto my voice : for they will say , the lord have not appear unto thee .
and the lord say unto he , what be that in thine hand ?
and he say , a rod .
and he say , cast it on the ground .
and he cast it on the ground , and it become a serpent ; and moses flee from before it .
and the lord say unto moses , put forth thine hand , and take it by the tail .
and he put forth he hand , and catch it , and it become a rod in he hand :
that they may believe that the lord god of they father , the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob , have appear unto thee .
and the lord say furthermore unto he , put now thine hand into thy bosom .
and he put he hand into he bosom : and when he take it out , behold , he hand be leprous as snow .
and he say , put thine hand into thy bosom again .
and he put he hand into he bosom again ; and pluck it out of he bosom , and , behold , it be turn again as he other flesh .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two sign , neither hearken unto thy voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour it upon the dry land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land .
and moses say unto the lord , o my lord , i be not eloquent , neither heretofore , nor since thou hast speak unto thy servant : but i be slow of speech , and of a slow tongue .
and the lord say unto he , who have make man 's mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the see , or the blind ? have not i the lord ?
now therefore go , and i will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt say .
and he say , o my lord , send , i pray thee , by the hand of he whom thou wilt send .
and the anger of the lord be kindle against moses , and he say , be not aaron the levite thy brother ?
i know that he can speak well .
and also , behold , he cometh forth to meet thee : and when he seeth thee , he will be glad in he heart .
and thou shalt speak unto he , and put word in he mouth : and i will be with thy mouth , and with he mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to he instead of god .
and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand , wherewith thou shalt do sign .
and moses go and return to jethro he father in law , and say unto he , let i go , i pray thee , and return unto my brethren which be in egypt , and see whether they be yet alive .
and jethro say to moses , go in peace .
and the lord say unto mose in midian , go , return into egypt : for all the man be dead which seek thy life .
and moses take he wife and he son , and set they upon a ass , and he return to the land of egypt : and moses take the rod of god in he hand .
and the lord say unto mose , when thou goest to return into egypt , see that thou do all those wonder before pharaoh , which i have put in thine hand : but i will harden he heart , that he shall not let the people go .
and thou shalt say unto pharaoh , thus saith the lord , israel be my son , even my firstborn :
and i say unto thee , let my son go , that he may serve i : and if thou refuse to let he go , behold , i will slay thy son , even thy firstborn .
and it come to pass by the way in the inn , that the lord meet he , and seek to kill he .
then zipporah take a sharp stone , and cut off the foreskin of she son , and cast it at he foot , and say , surely a bloody husband art thou to i .
so he let he go : then she say , a bloody husband thou art , because of the circumcision .
and the lord say to aaron , go into the wilderness to meet moses .
and he go , and meet he in the mount of god , and kiss he .
and moses tell aaron all the word of the lord who have send he , and all the sign which he have command he .
and moses and aaron go and gather together all the elder of the child of israel :
and aaron speak all the word which the lord have speak unto mose , and do the sign in the sight of the people .
and the people believe : and when they hear that the lord have visit the child of israel , and that he have look upon they affliction , then they bow they head and worship .
and afterward moses and aaron go in , and tell pharaoh , thus saith the lord god of israel , let my people go , that they may hold a feast unto i in the wilderness .
and pharaoh say , who be the lord , that i should obey he voice to let israel go ?
i know not the lord , neither will i let israel go .
and they say , the god of the hebrews have meet with we : let we go , we pray thee , three day ' journey into the desert , and sacrifice unto the lord we god ; lest he fall upon we with pestilence , or with the sword .
and the king of egypt say unto they , wherefore do ye , moses and aaron , let the people from they work ? get you unto you burden .
and pharaoh say , behold , the people of the land now be many , and ye make they rest from they burden .
and pharaoh command the same day the taskmaster of the people , and they officer , say ,
ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as heretofore : let they go and gather straw for themselves .
and the tale of the brick , which they do make heretofore , ye shall lay upon they ; ye shall not diminish ought thereof : for they be idle ; therefore they cry , say , let we go and sacrifice to we god .
let there more work be lay upon the man , that they may labour therein ; and let they not regard vain word .
and the taskmaster of the people go out , and they officer , and they speak to the people , say , thus saith pharaoh , i will not give you straw .
go ye , get you straw where ye can find it : yet not ought of you work shall be diminish .
so the people be scatter abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble instead of straw .
and the taskmaster hast they , say , fulfil you work , you daily task , as when there be straw .
and the officer of the child of israel , which pharaoh 's taskmaster have set over they , be beat , and demand , wherefore have ye not fulfil you task in make brick both yesterday and to day , as heretofore ?
then the officer of the child of israel come and cry unto pharaoh , say , wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servant ?
there be no straw give unto thy servant , and they say to we , make brick : and , behold , thy servant be beat ; but the fault be in thine own people .
but he say , ye be idle , ye be idle : therefore ye say , let we go and do sacrifice to the lord .
go therefore now , and work ; for there shall no straw be give you , yet shall ye deliver the tale of brick .
and the officer of the child of israel do see that they be in evil case , after it be say , ye shall not minish ought from you brick of you daily task .
and they meet moses and aaron , who stand in the way , as they come forth from pharaoh :
and they say unto they , the lord look upon you , and judge ; because ye have make we savour to be abhor in the eye of pharaoh , and in the eye of he servant , to put a sword in they hand to slay we .
and moses return unto the lord , and say , lord , wherefore hast thou so evil entreat this people ? why be it that thou hast send i ?
for since i come to pharaoh to speak in thy name , he have do evil to this people ; neither hast thou deliver thy people at all .
then the lord say unto mose , now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh : for with a strong hand shall he let they go , and with a strong hand shall he drive they out of he land .
and god speak unto mose , and say unto he , i be the lord :
and i appear unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob , by the name of god almighty , but by my name jehovah be i not know to they .
and i have also establish my covenant with they , to give they the land of canaan , the land of they pilgrimage , wherein they be stranger .
and i have also hear the groaning of the child of israel , whom the egyptians keep in bondage ; and i have remember my covenant .
wherefore say unto the child of israel , i be the lord , and i will bring you out from under the burden of the egyptians , and i will rid you out of they bondage , and i will redeem you with a stretch out arm , and with great judgment :
and i will take you to i for a people , and i will be to you a god : and ye shall know that i be the lord you god , which bringeth you out from under the burden of the egyptians .
and i will bring you in unto the land , concern the which i do swear to give it to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob ; and i will give it you for a heritage : i be the lord .
and moses spake so unto the child of israel : but they hearken not unto mose for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
go in , speak unto pharaoh king of egypt , that he let the child of israel go out of he land .
and moses spake before the lord , say , behold , the child of israel have not hearken unto i ; how then shall pharaoh hear i , who be of uncircumcised lip ?
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , and give they a charge unto the child of israel , and unto pharaoh king of egypt , to bring the child of israel out of the land of egypt .

and it come to pass on the day when the lord speak unto mose in the land of egypt ,
that the lord speak unto mose , say , i be the lord : speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto thee .
and moses say before the lord , behold , i be of uncircumcised lip , and how shall pharaoh hearken unto i ?
and the lord say unto mose , see , i have make thee a god to pharaoh : and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet .
thou shalt speak all that i command thee : and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh , that he send the child of israel out of he land .
and i will harden pharaoh 's heart , and multiply my sign and my wonder in the land of egypt .
but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that i may lay my hand upon egypt , and bring forth mine army , and my people the child of israel , out of the land of egypt by great judgment .
and the egyptians shall know that i be the lord , when i stretch forth mine hand upon egypt , and bring out the child of israel from among they .
and moses and aaron do as the lord command they , so do they .
and moses be fourscore year old , and aaron fourscore and three year old , when they speak unto pharaoh .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
when pharaoh shall speak unto you , say , shew a miracle for you : then thou shalt say unto aaron , take thy rod , and cast it before pharaoh , and it shall become a serpent .
and moses and aaron go in unto pharaoh , and they do so as the lord have command : and aaron cast down he rod before pharaoh , and before he servant , and it become a serpent .
then pharaoh also call the wise man and the sorcerer : now the magician of egypt , they also do in like manner with they enchantment .
for they cast down every man he rod , and they become serpent : but aaron 's rod swallow up they rod .
and he harden pharaoh 's heart , that he hearken not unto they ; as the lord have say .
and the lord say unto mose , pharaoh 's heart be harden , he refuseth to let the people go .
get thee unto pharaoh in the morning ; lo , he goeth out unto the water ; and thou shalt stand by the river 's brink against he come ; and the rod which be turn to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand .
and thou shalt say unto he , the lord god of the hebrews have send i unto thee , say , let my people go , that they may serve i in the wilderness : and , behold , hitherto thou wouldest not hear .
thus saith the lord , in this thou shalt know that i be the lord : behold , i will smite with the rod that be in mine hand upon the water which be in the river , and they shall be turn to blood .
and the fish that be in the river shall die , and the river shall stink ; and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river .
and the lord speak unto mose , say unto aaron , take thy rod , and stretch out thine hand upon the water of egypt , upon they stream , upon they river , and upon they pond , and upon all they pool of water , that they may become blood ; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of egypt , both in vessel of wood , and in vessel of stone .
and moses and aaron do so , as the lord command ; and he lift up the rod , and smite the water that be in the river , in the sight of pharaoh , and in the sight of he servant ; and all the water that be in the river be turn to blood .
and the fish that be in the river die ; and the river stank , and the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there be blood throughout all the land of egypt .
and the magician of egypt do so with they enchantment : and pharaoh 's heart be harden , neither do he hearken unto they ; as the lord have say .
and pharaoh turn and go into he house , neither do he set he heart to this also .
and all the egyptians dig round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
and seven day be fulfil , after that the lord have smite the river .
and the lord speak unto mose , go unto pharaoh , and say unto he , thus saith the lord , let my people go , that they may serve i .
and if thou refuse to let they go , behold , i will smite all thy border with frog :
and the river shall bring forth frog abundantly , which shall go up and come into thine house , and into thy bedchamber , and upon thy bed , and into the house of thy servant , and upon thy people , and into thine oven , and into thy kneadingtrough :
and the frog shall come up both on thee , and upon thy people , and upon all thy servant .
and the lord speak unto mose , say unto aaron , stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the stream , over the river , and over the pond , and cause frog to come up upon the land of egypt .
and aaron stretch out he hand over the water of egypt ; and the frog come up , and cover the land of egypt .
and the magician do so with they enchantment , and bring up frog upon the land of egypt .
then pharaoh call for mose and aaron , and say , intreat the lord , that he may take away the frog from i , and from my people ; and i will let the people go , that they may do sacrifice unto the lord .
and moses say unto pharaoh , glory over i : when shall i intreat for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy people , to destroy the frog from thee and thy house , that they may remain in the river only ?
and he say , to morrow .
and he say , be it accord to thy word : that thou mayest know that there be none like unto the lord we god .
and the frog shall depart from thee , and from thy house , and from thy servant , and from thy people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and moses and aaron go out from pharaoh : and moses cry unto the lord because of the frog which he have bring against pharaoh .
and the lord do accord to the word of moses ; and the frog die out of the house , out of the village , and out of the field .
and they gather they together upon heap : and the land stank .
but when pharaoh see that there be respite , he harden he heart , and hearken not unto they ; as the lord have say .
and the lord say unto mose , say unto aaron , stretch out thy rod , and smite the dust of the land , that it may become louse throughout all the land of egypt .
and they do so ; for aaron stretch out he hand with he rod , and smite the dust of the earth , and it become louse in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land become louse throughout all the land of egypt .
and the magician do so with they enchantment to bring forth louse , but they could not : so there be louse upon man , and upon beast .
then the magician say unto pharaoh , this be the finger of god : and pharaoh 's heart be harden , and he hearken not unto they ; as the lord have say .
and the lord say unto mose , rise up early in the morning , and stand before pharaoh ; lo , he cometh forth to the water ; and say unto he , thus saith the lord , let my people go , that they may serve i .
else , if thou wilt not let my people go , behold , i will send swarm of fly upon thee , and upon thy servant , and upon thy people , and into thy house : and the house of the egyptians shall be full of swarm of fly , and also the ground whereon they be .
and i will sever in that day the land of goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarm of fly shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that i be the lord in the midst of the earth .
and i will put a division between my people and thy people : to morrow shall this sign be .
and the lord do so ; and there come a grievous swarm of fly into the house of pharaoh , and into he servant ' house , and into all the land of egypt : the land be corrupt by reason of the swarm of fly .
and pharaoh call for moses and for aaron , and say , go ye , sacrifice to you god in the land .
and moses say , it be not meet so to do ; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord we god : lo , shall we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before they eye , and will they not stone we ?
we will go three day ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to the lord we god , as he shall command we .
and pharaoh say , i will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the lord you god in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : intreat for i .
and moses say , behold , i go out from thee , and i will intreat the lord that the swarm of fly may depart from pharaoh , from he servant , and from he people , to morrow : but let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not let the people go to sacrifice to the lord .
and moses go out from pharaoh , and intreat the lord .
and the lord do accord to the word of moses ; and he remove the swarm of fly from pharaoh , from he servant , and from he people ; there remain not one .
and pharaoh harden he heart at this time also , neither would he let the people go .
then the lord say unto mose , go in unto pharaoh , and tell he , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , let my people go , that they may serve i .
for if thou refuse to let they go , and wilt hold they still ,
behold , the hand of the lord be upon thy cattle which be in the field , upon the horse , upon the ass , upon the camel , upon the ox , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very grievous murrain .
and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that be the child 's of israel .
and the lord appoint a set time , say , to morrow the lord shall do this thing in the land .
and the lord do that thing on the morrow , and all the cattle of egypt die : but of the cattle of the child of israel die not one .
and pharaoh send , and , behold , there be not one of the cattle of the israelites dead .
and the heart of pharaoh be harden , and he do not let the people go .
and the lord say unto mose and unto aaron , take to you handful of ash of the furnace , and let mose sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of pharaoh .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt , and shall be a boil break forth with blain upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of egypt .
and they take ash of the furnace , and stand before pharaoh ; and moses sprinkle it up toward heaven ; and it become a boil break forth with blain upon man , and upon beast .
and the magician could not stand before mose because of the boil ; for the boil be upon the magician , and upon all the egyptians .
and the lord harden the heart of pharaoh , and he hearken not unto they ; as the lord have speak unto mose .
and the lord say unto mose , rise up early in the morning , and stand before pharaoh , and say unto he , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , let my people go , that they may serve i .
for i will at this time send all my plague upon thine heart , and upon thy servant , and upon thy people ; that thou mayest know that there be none like i in all the earth .
for now i will stretch out my hand , that i may smite thee and thy people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
and in very deed for this cause have i raise thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declare throughout all the earth .
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people , that thou wilt not let they go ?
behold , to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as have not be in egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
send therefore now , and gather thy cattle , and all that thou hast in the field ; for upon every man and beast which shall be find in the field , and shall not be bring home , the hail shall come down upon they , and they shall die .
he that fear the word of the lord among the servant of pharaoh make he servant and he cattle flee into the house :
and he that regard not the word of the lord leave he servant and he cattle in the field .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch forth thine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of egypt , upon man , and upon beast , and upon every herb of the field , throughout the land of egypt .
and moses stretch forth he rod toward heaven : and the lord send thunder and hail , and the fire run along upon the ground ; and the lord rain hail upon the land of egypt .
so there be hail , and fire mingle with the hail , very grievous , such as there be none like it in all the land of egypt since it become a nation .
and the hail smite throughout all the land of egypt all that be in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smite every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
only in the land of goshen , where the child of israel be , be there no hail .
and pharaoh send , and call for mose and aaron , and say unto they , i have sin this time : the lord be righteous , and i and my people be wicked .
intreat the lord ( for it be enough ) that there be no more mighty thundering and hail ; and i will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
and moses say unto he , as soon as i be go out of the city , i will spread abroad my hand unto the lord ; and the thunder shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that thou mayest know how that the earth be the lord 's .
but as for thee and thy servant , i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god .
and the flax and the barley be smitten : for the barley be in the ear , and the flax be boll .
but the wheat and the rie be not smitten : for they be not grow up .
and moses go out of the city from pharaoh , and spread abroad he hand unto the lord : and the thunder and hail cease , and the rain be not pour upon the earth .
and when pharaoh see that the rain and the hail and the thunder be cease , he sin yet more , and harden he heart , he and he servant .
and the heart of pharaoh be harden , neither would he let the child of israel go ; as the lord have speak by moses .
and the lord say unto mose , go in unto pharaoh : for i have harden he heart , and the heart of he servant , that i might shew these my sign before he :
and that thou mayest tell in the ear of thy son , and of thy son 's son , what thing i have work in egypt , and my sign which i have do among they ; that ye may know how that i be the lord .
and moses and aaron come in unto pharaoh , and say unto he , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before i ? let my people go , that they may serve i .
else , if thou refuse to let my people go , behold , to morrow will i bring the locust into thy coast :
and they shall cover the face of the earth , that one can not be able to see the earth : and they shall eat the residue of that which be escape , which remaineth unto you from the hail , and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field :
and they shall fill thy house , and the house of all thy servant , and the house of all the egyptians ; which neither thy father , nor thy father ' father have see , since the day that they be upon the earth unto this day .
and he turn himself , and go out from pharaoh .
and pharaoh 's servant say unto he , how long shall this man be a snare unto we ? let the man go , that they may serve the lord they god : knowest thou not yet that egypt be destroy ?
and moses and aaron be bring again unto pharaoh : and he say unto they , go , serve the lord you god : but who be they that shall go ?
and moses say , we will go with we young and with we old , with we son and with we daughter , with we flock and with we herd will we go ; for we must hold a feast unto the lord .
and he say unto they , let the lord be so with you , as i will let you go , and you little one : look to it ; for evil be before you .
not so : go now ye that be man , and serve the lord ; for that ye do desire .
and they be drive out from pharaoh 's presence .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch out thine hand over the land of egypt for the locust , that they may come up upon the land of egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail have leave .
and moses stretch forth he rod over the land of egypt , and the lord bring a east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it be morning , the east wind bring the locust .
and the locust go up over all the land of egypt , and rest in all the coast of egypt : very grievous be they ; before they there be no such locust as they , neither after they shall be such .
for they cover the face of the whole earth , so that the land be darken ; and they do eat every herb of the land , and all the fruit of the tree which the hail have leave : and there remain not any green thing in the tree , or in the herb of the field , through all the land of egypt .
then pharaoh call for mose and aaron in haste ; and he say , i have sin against the lord you god , and against you .
now therefore forgive , i pray thee , my sin only this once , and intreat the lord you god , that he may take away from i this death only .
and he go out from pharaoh , and intreat the lord .
and the lord turn a mighty strong west wind , which take away the locust , and cast they into the red sea ; there remain not one locust in all the coast of egypt .
but the lord harden pharaoh 's heart , so that he would not let the child of israel go .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch out thine hand toward heaven , that there may be darkness over the land of egypt , even darkness which may be feel .
and moses stretch forth he hand toward heaven ; and there be a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three day :
they see not one another , neither rise any from he place for three day : but all the child of israel have light in they dwelling .
and pharaoh call unto mose , and say , go ye , serve the lord ; only let you flock and you herd be stay : let you little one also go with you .
and moses say , thou must give we also sacrifice and burnt offering , that we may sacrifice unto the lord we god .
we cattle also shall go with we ; there shall not a hoof be leave behind ; for thereof must we take to serve the lord we god ; and we know not with what we must serve the lord , until we come thither .
but the lord harden pharaoh 's heart , and he would not let they go .
and pharaoh say unto he , get thee from i , take heed to thyself , see my face no more ; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die .
and moses say , thou hast speak well , i will see thy face again no more .
and the lord say unto mose , yet will i bring one plague more upon pharaoh , and upon egypt ; afterwards he will let you go hence : when he shall let you go , he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether .
speak now in the ear of the people , and let every man borrow of he neighbour , and every woman of she neighbour , jewel of silver , and jewel of gold .
and the lord give the people favour in the sight of the egyptians .
moreover the man moses be very great in the land of egypt , in the sight of pharaoh 's servant , and in the sight of the people .
and moses say , thus saith the lord , about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt :
and all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die , from the first bear of pharaoh that sitteth upon he throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that be behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of beast .
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt , such as there be none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
but against any of the child of israel shall not a dog move he tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the lord doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel .
and all these thy servant shall come down unto i , and bow down themselves unto i , say , get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that i will go out .
and he go out from pharaoh in a great anger .
and the lord say unto mose , pharaoh shall not hearken unto you ; that my wonder may be multiply in the land of egypt .
and moses and aaron do all these wonder before pharaoh : and the lord harden pharaoh 's heart , so that he would not let the child of israel go out of he land .
and the lord speak unto mose and aaron in the land of egypt , say ,
this month shall be unto you the beginning of month : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
speak ye unto all the congregation of israel , say , in the tenth day of this month they shall take to they every man a lamb , accord to the house of they father , a lamb for a house :
and if the household be too little for the lamb , let he and he neighbour next unto he house take it accord to the number of the soul ; every man accord to he eating shall make you count for the lamb .
you lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goat :
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side post and on the upper door post of the house , wherein they shall eat it .
and they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; and with bitter herb they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roast with fire ; he head with he leg , and with the purtenance thereof .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with you loin gird , you shoe on you foot , and you staff in you hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste : it be the lord 's passover .
for i will pass through the land of egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the god of egypt i will execute judgment : i be the lord .
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the house where ye be : and when i see the blood , i will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when i smite the land of egypt .
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout you generation ; ye shall keep it a feast by a ordinance for ever .
seven day shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of you house : for whosoever eateth leaven bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from israel .
and in the first day there shall be a holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be do in they , save that which every man must eat , that only may be do of you .
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this selfsame day have i bring you army out of the land of egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in you generation by a ordinance for ever .
in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at even , ye shall eat unleavened bread , until the one and twentieth day of the month at even .
seven day shall there be no leaven find in you house : for whosoever eateth that which be leaven , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel , whether he be a stranger , or bear in the land .
ye shall eat nothing leaven ; in all you habitation shall ye eat unleavened bread .
then moses call for all the elder of israel , and say unto they , draw out and take you a lamb accord to you family , and kill the passover .
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that be in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side post with the blood that be in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of he house until the morning .
for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians ; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel , and on the two side post , the lord will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto you house to smite you .
and ye shall observe this thing for a ordinance to thee and to thy son for ever .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you , accord as he have promise , that ye shall keep this service .
and it shall come to pass , when you child shall say unto you , what mean ye by this service ?
that ye shall say , it be the sacrifice of the lord 's passover , who pass over the house of the child of israel in egypt , when he smite the egyptians , and deliver we house .
and the people bow the head and worship .
and the child of israel go away , and do as the lord have command moses and aaron , so do they .
and it come to pass , that at midnight the lord smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt , from the firstborn of pharaoh that sit on he throne unto the firstborn of the captive that be in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of cattle .
and pharaoh rise up in the night , he , and all he servant , and all the egyptians ; and there be a great cry in egypt ; for there be not a house where there be not one dead .
and he call for moses and aaron by night , and say , rise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the child of israel ; and go , serve the lord , as ye have say .
also take you flock and you herd , as ye have say , and be go ; and bless i also .
and the egyptians be urgent upon the people , that they might send they out of the land in haste ; for they say , we be all dead man .
and the people take they dough before it be leaven , they kneadingtrough be bind up in they clothes upon they shoulder .
and the child of israel do accord to the word of moses ; and they borrow of the egyptians jewel of silver , and jewel of gold , and raiment :
and the lord give the people favour in the sight of the egyptians , so that they lend unto they such thing as they require .
and they spoil the egyptians .
and the child of israel journey from rameses to succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that be man , beside child .
and a mixed multitude go up also with they ; and flock , and herd , even very much cattle .
and they baked unleavened cake of the dough which they bring forth out of egypt , for it be not leaven ; because they be thrust out of egypt , and could not tarry , neither have they prepare for themselves any victual .
now the sojourning of the child of israel , who dwell in egypt , be four hundred and thirty year .
and it come to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty year , even the selfsame day it come to pass , that all the host of the lord go out from the land of egypt .
it be a night to be much observe unto the lord for bring they out from the land of egypt : this be that night of the lord to be observe of all the child of israel in they generation .
and the lord say unto mose and aaron , this be the ordinance of the passover : there shall no stranger eat thereof :
but every man 's servant that be buy for money , when thou hast circumcise he , then shall he eat thereof .
a foreigner and a hire servant shall not eat thereof .
in one house shall it be eat ; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
all the congregation of israel shall keep it .
and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee , and will keep the passover to the lord , let all he male be circumcise , and then let he come near and keep it ; and he shall be as one that be bear in the land : for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof .
one law shall be to he that be homeborn , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you .
thus do all the child of israel ; as the lord command moses and aaron , so do they .
and it come to pass the selfsame day , that the lord do bring the child of israel out of the land of egypt by they army .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
sanctify unto i all the firstborn , whatsoever openeth the womb among the child of israel , both of man and of beast : it be mine .
and moses say unto the people , remember this day , in which ye come out from egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the lord bring you out from this place : there shall no leavened bread be eat .
this day come ye out in the month abib .
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites , and the hittites , and the amorites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , which he sware unto thy father to give thee , a land flow with milk and honey , that thou shalt keep this service in this month .
seven day thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord .
unleavened bread shall be eat seven day ; and there shall no leavened bread be see with thee , neither shall there be leaven see with thee in all thy quarter .
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day , say , this be do because of that which the lord do unto i when i come forth out of egypt .
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eye , that the lord 's law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hand have the lord bring thee out of egypt .
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in he season from year to year .
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites , as he sware unto thee and to thy father , and shall give it thee ,
that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the matrix , and every firstle that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the male shall be the lord 's .
and every firstling of a ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb ; and if thou wilt not redeem it , then thou shalt break he neck : and all the firstborn of man among thy child shalt thou redeem .
and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come , say , what be this ? that thou shalt say unto he , by strength of hand the lord bring we out from egypt , from the house of bondage :
and it come to pass , when pharaoh would hardly let we go , that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt , both the firstborn of man , and the firstborn of beast : therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the matrix , be male ; but all the firstborn of my child i redeem .
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand , and for frontlet between thine eye : for by strength of hand the lord bring we forth out of egypt .
and it come to pass , when pharaoh have let the people go , that god lead they not through the way of the land of the philistines , although that be near ; for god say , lest peradventure the people repent when they see war , and they return to egypt :
but god lead the people about , through the way of the wilderness of the red sea : and the child of israel go up harness out of the land of egypt .
and moses take the bone of joseph with he : for he have straitly swear the child of israel , say , god will surely visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bone away hence with you .
and they take they journey from succoth , and encamp in etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
and the lord go before they by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead they the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give they light ; to go by day and night :
he take not away the pillar of the cloud by day , nor the pillar of fire by night , from before the people .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , that they turn and encamp before pihahiroth , between migdol and the sea , over against baalzephon : before it shall ye encamp by the sea .
for pharaoh will say of the child of israel , they be entangled in the land , the wilderness have shut they in .
and i will harden pharaoh 's heart , that he shall follow after they ; and i will be honour upon pharaoh , and upon all he host ; that the egyptians may know that i be the lord .
and they do so .
and it be tell the king of egypt that the people flee : and the heart of pharaoh and of he servant be turn against the people , and they say , why have we do this , that we have let israel go from serve we ?
and he make ready he chariot , and take he people with he :
and he take six hundred choose chariot , and all the chariot of egypt , and captain over every one of they .
and the lord harden the heart of pharaoh king of egypt , and he pursue after the child of israel : and the child of israel go out with a high hand .
but the egyptians pursue after they , all the horse and chariot of pharaoh , and he horseman , and he army , and overtake they encamp by the sea , beside pihahiroth , before baalzephon .
and when pharaoh draw nigh , the child of israel lift up they eye , and , behold , the egyptians march after they ; and they be sore afraid : and the child of israel cry out unto the lord .
and they say unto mose , because there be no grave in egypt , hast thou take we away to die in the wilderness ? wherefore hast thou deal thus with we , to carry we forth out of egypt ?
be not this the word that we do tell thee in egypt , say , let we alone , that we may serve the egyptians ?
for it have be better for we to serve the egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
and moses say unto the people , fear ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the lord , which he will shew to you to day : for the egyptians whom ye have see to day , ye shall see they again no more for ever .
the lord shall fight for you , and ye shall hold you peace .
and the lord say unto moses , wherefore criest thou unto i ? speak unto the child of israel , that they go forward :
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the child of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and i , behold , i will harden the heart of the egyptians , and they shall follow they : and i will get i honour upon pharaoh , and upon all he host , upon he chariot , and upon he horseman .
and the egyptians shall know that i be the lord , when i have get i honour upon pharaoh , upon he chariot , and upon he horseman .
and the angel of god , which go before the camp of israel , remove and go behind they ; and the pillar of the cloud go from before they face , and stand behind they :
and it come between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel ; and it be a cloud and darkness to they , but it give light by night to these : so that the one come not near the other all the night .
and moses stretch out he hand over the sea ; and the lord cause the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and make the sea dry land , and the water be divide .
and the child of israel go into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the water be a wall unto they on they right hand , and on they leave .
and the egyptians pursue , and go in after they to the midst of the sea , even all pharaoh 's horse , he chariot , and he horseman .
and it come to pass , that in the morning watch the lord look unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and trouble the host of the egyptians ,
and take off they chariot wheel , that they drave they heavily : so that the egyptians say , let we flee from the face of israel ; for the lord fighteth for they against the egyptians .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch out thine hand over the sea , that the water may come again upon the egyptians , upon they chariot , and upon they horseman .
and moses stretch forth he hand over the sea , and the sea return to he strength when the morning appear ; and the egyptians flee against it ; and the lord overthrow the egyptians in the midst of the sea .
and the water return , and cover the chariot , and the horseman , and all the host of pharaoh that come into the sea after they ; there remain not so much as one of they .
but the child of israel walk upon dry land in the midst of the sea ; and the water be a wall unto they on they right hand , and on they leave .
thus the lord save israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians ; and israel see the egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
and israel see that great work which the lord do upon the egyptians : and the people fear the lord , and believe the lord , and he servant mose .
then sing moses and the child of israel this song unto the lord , and spake , say , i will sing unto the lord , for he have triumph gloriously : the horse and he rider have he throw into the sea .
the lord be my strength and song , and he be become my salvation : he be my god , and i will prepare he a habitation ; my father 's god , and i will exalt he .
the lord be a man of war : the lord be he name .
pharaoh 's chariot and he host have he cast into the sea : he choose captain also be drown in the red sea .
the depths have cover they : they sink into the bottom as a stone .
thy right hand , o lord , be become glorious in power : thy right hand , o lord , have dash in piece the enemy .
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrow they that rise up against thee : thou sentest forth thy wrath , which consume they as stubble .
and with the blast of thy nostril the water be gather together , the flood stand upright as a heap , and the depths be congeal in the heart of the sea .
the enemy say , i will pursue , i will overtake , i will divide the spoil ; my lust shall be satisfy upon they ; i will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy they .
thou didst blow with thy wind , the sea cover they : they sink as lead in the mighty water .
who be like unto thee , o lord , among the god ? who be like thee , glorious in holiness , fearful in praise , do wonder ?
thou stretchedst out thy right hand , the earth swallow they .
thou in thy mercy hast lead forth the people which thou hast redeem : thou hast guide they in thy strength unto thy holy habitation .
the people shall hear , and be afraid : sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitant of palestina .
then the duke of edom shall be amaze ; the mighty man of moab , tremble shall take hold upon they ; all the inhabitant of canaan shall melt away .
fear and dread shall fall upon they ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till thy people pass over , o lord , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchase .
thou shalt bring they in , and plant they in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , o lord , which thou hast make for thee to dwell in , in the sanctuary , o lord , which thy hand have establish .
the lord shall reign for ever and ever .
for the horse of pharaoh go in with he chariot and with he horseman into the sea , and the lord bring again the water of the sea upon they ; but the child of israel go on dry land in the midst of the sea .
and miriam the prophetess , the sister of aaron , take a timbrel in she hand ; and all the woman go out after she with timbrel and with dance .
and miriam answer they , sing ye to the lord , for he have triumph gloriously ; the horse and he rider have he throw into the sea .
so mose bring israel from the red sea , and they go out into the wilderness of shur ; and they go three day in the wilderness , and find no water .
and when they come to marah , they could not drink of the water of marah , for they be bitter : therefore the name of it be call marah .
and the people murmur against moses , say , what shall we drink ?
and he cry unto the lord ; and the lord shew he a tree , which when he have cast into the water , the water be make sweet : there he make for they a statute and a ordinance , and there he prove they ,
and say , if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god , and wilt do that which be right in he sight , and wilt give ear to he commandment , and keep all he statute , i will put none of these disease upon thee , which i have bring upon the egyptians : for i be the lord that healeth thee .
and they come to elim , where be twelve well of water , and threescore and ten palm tree : and they encamp there by the water .
and they take they journey from elim , and all the congregation of the child of israel come unto the wilderness of sin , which be between elim and sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after they depart out of the land of egypt .
and the whole congregation of the child of israel murmur against moses and aaron in the wilderness :
and the child of israel say unto they , would to god we have die by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt , when we sit by the flesh pot , and when we do eat bread to the full ; for ye have bring we forth into this wilderness , to kill this whole assembly with hunger .
then say the lord unto moses , behold , i will rain bread from heaven for you ; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day , that i may prove they , whether they will walk in my law , or no. .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and moses and aaron say unto all the child of israel , at even , then ye shall know that the lord have bring you out from the land of egypt :
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the lord ; for that he heareth you murmuring against the lord : and what be we , that ye murmur against we ?
and moses say , this shall be , when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat , and in the morning bread to the full ; for that the lord heareth you murmuring which ye murmur against he : and what be we ? you murmuring be not against we , but against the lord .
and moses spake unto aaron , say unto all the congregation of the child of israel , come near before the lord : for he have hear you murmuring .
and it come to pass , as aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the child of israel , that they look toward the wilderness , and , behold , the glory of the lord appear in the cloud .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
i have hear the murmuring of the child of israel : speak unto they , say , at even ye shall eat flesh , and in the morning ye shall be fill with bread ; and ye shall know that i be the lord you god .
and it come to pass , that at even the quail come up , and cover the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when the dew that lay be go up , behold , upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing , as small as the hoar frost on the ground .
and when the child of israel see it , they say one to another , it be manna : for they wist not what it be .
and moses say unto they , this be the bread which the lord have give you to eat .
this be the thing which the lord have command , gather of it every man accord to he eating , a omer for every man , accord to the number of you person ; take ye every man for they which be in he tent .
and the child of israel do so , and gather , some more , some less .
and when they do mete it with a omer , he that gather much have nothing over , and he that gather little have no lack ; they gather every man accord to he eating .
and moses say , let no man leave of it till the morning .
notwithstanding they hearken not unto mose ; but some of they leave of it until the morning , and it breed worm , and stank : and moses be wroth with they .
and they gather it every morning , every man accord to he eating : and when the sun wax hot , it melt .
and it come to pass , that on the sixth day they gather twice as much bread , two omer for one man : and all the ruler of the congregation come and tell moses .
and he say unto they , this be that which the lord have say , to morrow be the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord : bake that which ye will bake to day , and seethe that ye will seethe ; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be keep until the morning .
and they lay it up till the morning , as moses bid : and it do not stink , neither be there any worm therein .
and moses say , eat that to day ; for to day be a sabbath unto the lord : to day ye shall not find it in the field .
six day ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which be the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
and it come to pass , that there go out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather , and they find none .
and the lord say unto mose , how long refuse ye to keep my commandment and my law ?
see , for that the lord have give you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two day ; abide ye every man in he place , let no man go out of he place on the seventh day .
so the people rest on the seventh day .
and the house of israel call the name thereof manna : and it be like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it be like wafer make with honey .
and moses say , this be the thing which the lord commandeth , fill a omer of it to be keep for you generation ; that they may see the bread wherewith i have feed you in the wilderness , when i bring you forth from the land of egypt .
and moses say unto aaron , take a pot , and put a omer full of manna therein , and lay it up before the lord , to be keep for you generation .
as the lord command moses , so aaron lay it up before the testimony , to be keep .
and the child of israel do eat manna forty year , until they come to a land inhabit ; they do eat manna , until they come unto the border of the land of canaan .
now a omer be the tenth part of a ephah .
and all the congregation of the child of israel journey from the wilderness of sin , after they journey , accord to the commandment of the lord , and pitch in rephidim : and there be no water for the people to drink .
wherefore the people do chide with mose , and say , give we water that we may drink .
and moses say unto they , why chide ye with i ? wherefore do ye tempt the lord ?
and the people thirst there for water ; and the people murmur against moses , and say , wherefore be this that thou hast bring we up out of egypt , to kill we and we child and we cattle with thirst ?
and moses cry unto the lord , say , what shall i do unto this people ? they be almost ready to stone i .
and the lord say unto mose , go on before the people , and take with thee of the elder of israel ; and thy rod , wherewith thou smotest the river , take in thine hand , and go .
behold , i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink .
and moses do so in the sight of the elder of israel .
and he call the name of the place massah , and meribah , because of the chiding of the child of israel , and because they tempt the lord , say , be the lord among we , or not ?
then come amalek , and fight with israel in rephidim .
and moses say unto joshua , choose we out man , and go out , fight with amalek : to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in mine hand .
so joshua do as moses have say to he , and fight with amalek : and moses , aaron , and hur go up to the top of the hill .
and it come to pass , when moses hold up he hand , that israel prevail : and when he let down he hand , amalek prevail .
but moses ' hand be heavy ; and they take a stone , and put it under he , and he sit thereon ; and aaron and hur stay up he hand , the one on the one side , and the other on the other side ; and he hand be steady until the go down of the sun .
and joshua discomfited amalek and he people with the edge of the sword .
and the lord say unto mose , write this for a memorial in a book , and rehearse it in the ear of joshua : for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven .
and moses build a altar , and call the name of it jehovahnissus :
for he say , because the lord have swear that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation .
when jethro , the priest of midian , moses ' father in law , hear of all that god have do for moses , and for israel he people , and that the lord have bring israel out of egypt ;
then jethro , moses ' father in law , take zipporah , moses ' wife , after he have send she back ,
and she two son ; of which the name of the one be gershom ; for he say , i have be a alien in a strange land :
and the name of the other be eliezer ; for the god of my father , say he , be mine help , and deliver i from the sword of pharaoh :
and jethro , moses ' father in law , come with he son and he wife unto mose into the wilderness , where he encamp at the mount of god :
and he say unto mose , i thy father in law jethro be come unto thee , and thy wife , and she two son with she .
and moses go out to meet he father in law , and do obeisance , and kiss he ; and they ask each other of they welfare ; and they come into the tent .
and moses tell he father in law all that the lord have do unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israel 's sake , and all the travail that have come upon they by the way , and how the lord deliver they .
and jethro rejoice for all the goodness which the lord have do to israel , whom he have deliver out of the hand of the egyptians .
and jethro say , blessed be the lord , who have deliver you out of the hand of the egyptians , and out of the hand of pharaoh , who have deliver the people from under the hand of the egyptians .
now i know that the lord be greater than all god : for in the thing wherein they deal proudly he be above they .
and jethro , moses ' father in law , take a burnt offering and sacrifice for god : and aaron come , and all the elder of israel , to eat bread with mose ' father in law before god .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that mose sit to judge the people : and the people stand by mose from the morning unto the evening .
and when moses ' father in law see all that he do to the people , he say , what be this thing that thou doest to the people ? why sittest thou thyself alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ?
and moses say unto he father in law , because the people come unto i to enquire of god :
when they have a matter , they come unto i ; and i judge between one and another , and i do make they know the statute of god , and he law .
and moses ' father in law say unto he , the thing that thou doest be not good .
thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that be with thee : for this thing be too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
hearken now unto my voice , i will give thee counsel , and god shall be with thee : be thou for the people to god-ward , that thou mayest bring the cause unto god :
and thou shalt teach they ordinance and law , and shalt shew they the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able man , such as fear god , man of truth , hate covetousness ; and place such over they , to be ruler of thousand , and ruler of hundred , ruler of fifty , and ruler of ten :
and let they judge the people at all season : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
if thou shalt do this thing , and god command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to they place in peace .
so mose hearken to the voice of he father in law , and do all that he have say .
and moses choose able man out of all israel , and make they head over the people , ruler of thousand , ruler of hundred , ruler of fifty , and ruler of ten .
and they judge the people at all season : the hard cause they bring unto mose , but every small matter they judge themselves .
and moses let he father in law depart ; and he go he way into he own land .
in the third month , when the child of israel be go forth out of the land of egypt , the same day come they into the wilderness of sinai .
for they be depart from rephidim , and be come to the desert of sinai , and have pitch in the wilderness ; and there israel camp before the mount .
and moses go up unto god , and the lord call unto he out of the mountain , say , thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob , and tell the child of israel ;
ye have see what i do unto the egyptians , and how i bare you on eagle ' wing , and bring you unto myself .
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto i above all people : for all the earth be mine :
and ye shall be unto i a kingdom of priest , and a holy nation .
these be the word which thou shalt speak unto the child of israel .
and moses come and call for the elder of the people , and lay before they face all these word which the lord command he .
and all the people answer together , and say , all that the lord have speak we will do .
and moses return the word of the people unto the lord .
and the lord say unto mose , lo , i come unto thee in a thick cloud , that the people may hear when i speak with thee , and believe thee for ever .
and moses tell the word of the people unto the lord .
and the lord say unto mose , go unto the people , and sanctify they to day and to morrow , and let they wash they clothes ,
and be ready against the third day : for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai .
and thou shalt set bound unto the people round about , say , take heed to yourselve , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death :
there shall not a hand touch it , but he shall surely be stone , or shoot through ; whether it be beast or man , it shall not live : when the trumpet soundeth long , they shall come up to the mount .
and moses go down from the mount unto the people , and sanctify the people ; and they wash they clothes .
and he say unto the people , be ready against the third day : come not at you wife .
and it come to pass on the third day in the morning , that there be thunder and lightning , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceed loud ; so that all the people that be in the camp tremble .
and moses bring forth the people out of the camp to meet with god ; and they stand at the nether part of the mount .
and mount sinai be altogether on a smoke , because the lord descend upon it in fire : and the smoke thereof ascend as the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mount quake greatly .
and when the voice of the trumpet sound long , and wax louder and louder , moses spake , and god answer he by a voice .
and the lord come down upon mount sinai , on the top of the mount : and the lord call moses up to the top of the mount ; and moses go up .
and the lord say unto mose , go down , charge the people , lest they break through unto the lord to gaze , and many of they perish .
and let the priest also , which come near to the lord , sanctify themselves , lest the lord break forth upon they .
and moses say unto the lord , the people can not come up to mount sinai : for thou chargedst we , say , set bound about the mount , and sanctify it .
and the lord say unto he , away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and aaron with thee : but let not the priest and the people break through to come up unto the lord , lest he break forth upon they .
so moses go down unto the people , and spake unto they .
and god speak all these word , say ,
i be the lord thy god , which have bring thee out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondage .
thou shalt have no other god before i .
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that be in heaven above , or that be in the earth beneath , or that be in the water under the earth :
thou shalt not bow down thyself to they , nor serve they : for i the lord thy god be a jealous god , visit the iniquity of the father upon the child unto the third and fourth generation of they that hate i ;
and shew mercy unto thousand of they that love i , and keep my commandment .
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain ; for the lord will not hold he guiltless that taketh he name in vain .
remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy .
six day shalt thou labour , and do all thy work :
but the seventh day be the sabbath of the lord thy god : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that be within thy gate :
for in six day the lord make heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in they be , and rest the seventh day : wherefore the lord bless the sabbath day , and hallowed it .
honour thy father and thy mother : that thy day may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
thou shalt not kill .
thou shalt not commit adultery .
thou shalt not steal .
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour .
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's wife , nor he manservant , nor he maidservant , nor he ox , nor he ass , nor any thing that be thy neighbour 's .
and all the people see the thundering , and the lightning , and the noise of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking : and when the people see it , they remove , and stand afar off .
and they say unto mose , speak thou with we , and we will hear : but let not god speak with we , lest we die .
and moses say unto the people , fear not : for god be come to prove you , and that he fear may be before you face , that ye sin not .
and the people stand afar off , and moses draw near unto the thick darkness where god be .
and the lord say unto mose , thus thou shalt say unto the child of israel , ye have see that i have talk with you from heaven .
ye shall not make with i god of silver , neither shall ye make unto you god of gold .
a altar of earth thou shalt make unto i , and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offering , and thy peace offering , thy sheep , and thine ox : in all place where i record my name i will come unto thee , and i will bless thee .
and if thou wilt make i a altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hew stone : for if thou lift up thy tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
neither shalt thou go up by step unto mine altar , that thy nakedness be not discover thereon .
now these be the judgment which thou shalt set before they .
if thou buy a hebrew servant , six year he shall serve : and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing .
if he come in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he be marry , then he wife shall go out with he .
if he master have give he a wife , and she have bear he son or daughter ; the wife and she child shall be she master 's , and he shall go out by himself .
and if the servant shall plainly say , i love my master , my wife , and my child ; i will not go out free :
then he master shall bring he unto the judge ; he shall also bring he to the door , or unto the door post ; and he master shall bear he ear through with a aul ; and he shall serve he for ever .
and if a man sell he daughter to be a maidservant , she shall not go out as the manservant do .
if she please not she master , who have betroth she to himself , then shall he let she be redeem : to sell she unto a strange nation he shall have no power , see he have deal deceitfully with she .
and if he have betroth she unto he son , he shall deal with she after the manner of daughter .
if he take he another wife ; she food , she raiment , and she duty of marriage , shall he not diminish .
and if he do not these three unto she , then shall she go out free without money .
he that smiteth a man , so that he die , shall be surely put to death .
and if a man lie not in wait , but god deliver he into he hand ; then i will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
but if a man come presumptuously upon he neighbour , to slay he with guile ; thou shalt take he from mine altar , that he may die .
and he that smiteth he father , or he mother , shall be surely put to death .
and he that stealeth a man , and selleth he , or if he be find in he hand , he shall surely be put to death .
and he that curseth he father , or he mother , shall surely be put to death .
and if man strive together , and one smite another with a stone , or with he fist , and he die not , but keepeth he bed :
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon he staff , then shall he that smite he be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of he time , and shall cause he to be thoroughly heal .
and if a man smite he servant , or he maid , with a rod , and he die under he hand ; he shall be surely punish .
notwithstanding , if he continue a day or two , he shall not be punish : for he be he money .
if man strive , and hurt a woman with child , so that she fruit depart from she , and yet no mischief follow : he shall be surely punish , accord as the woman 's husband will lay upon he ; and he shall pay as the judge determine .
and if any mischief follow , then thou shalt give life for life ,
eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ,
burning for burning , wound for wound , stripe for stripe .
and if a man smite the eye of he servant , or the eye of he maid , that it perish ; he shall let he go free for he eye 's sake .
and if he smite out he manservant 's tooth , or he maidservant 's tooth ; he shall let he go free for he tooth 's sake .
if a ox gore a man or a woman , that they die : then the ox shall be surely stone , and he flesh shall not be eat ; but the owner of the ox shall be quit .
but if the ox be wont to push with he horn in time past , and it have be testify to he owner , and he have not keep he in , but that he have kill a man or a woman ; the ox shall be stone , and he owner also shall be put to death .
if there be lay on he a sum of money , then he shall give for the ransom of he life whatsoever be lay upon he .
whether he have gore a son , or have gore a daughter , accord to this judgment shall it be do unto he .
if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant ; he shall give unto they master thirty shekel of silver , and the ox shall be stone .
and if a man shall open a pit , or if a man shall dig a pit , and not cover it , and a ox or a ass fall therein ;
the owner of the pit shall make it good , and give money unto the owner of they ; and the dead beast shall be he .
and if one man 's ox hurt another 's , that he die ; then they shall sell the live ox , and divide the money of it ; and the dead ox also they shall divide .
or if it be know that the ox have use to push in time past , and he owner have not keep he in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be he own .
if a man shall steal a ox , or a sheep , and kill it , or sell it ; he shall restore five ox for a ox , and four sheep for a sheep .
if a thief be find break up , and be smite that he die , there shall no blood be shed for he .
if the sun be rise upon he , there shall be blood shed for he ; for he should make full restitution ; if he have nothing , then he shall be sell for he theft .
if the theft be certainly find in he hand alive , whether it be ox , or ass , or sheep ; he shall restore double .
if a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eat , and shall put in he beast , and shall feed in another man 's field ; of the best of he own field , and of the best of he own vineyard , shall he make restitution .
if fire break out , and catch in thorn , so that the stack of corn , or the standing corn , or the field , be consume therewith ; he that kindle the fire shall surely make restitution .
if a man shall deliver unto he neighbour money or stuff to keep , and it be steal out of the man 's house ; if the thief be find , let he pay double .
if the thief be not find , then the master of the house shall be bring unto the judge , to see whether he have put he hand unto he neighbour 's goods .
for all manner of trespass , whether it be for ox , for ass , for sheep , for raiment , or for any manner of lose thing , which another challengeth to be he , the cause of both party shall come before the judge ; and whom the judge shall condemn , he shall pay double unto he neighbour .
if a man deliver unto he neighbour a ass , or a ox , or a sheep , or any beast , to keep ; and it die , or be hurt , or drive away , no man see it :
then shall a oath of the lord be between they both , that he have not put he hand unto he neighbour 's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
and if it be steal from he , he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof .
if it be tear in piece , then let he bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which be tear .
and if a man borrow ought of he neighbour , and it be hurt , or die , the owner thereof be not with it , he shall surely make it good .
but if the owner thereof be with it , he shall not make it good : if it be a hire thing , it come for he hire .
and if a man entice a maid that be not betroth , and lie with she , he shall surely endow she to be he wife .
if she father utterly refuse to give she unto he , he shall pay money accord to the dowry of virgin .

ye shall keep the sabbath therefore ; for it be holy unto you : every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death : for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among he people .
six day may work be do ; but in the seventh be the sabbath of rest , holy to the lord : whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
wherefore the child of israel shall keep the sabbath , to observe the sabbath throughout they generation , for a perpetual covenant .

and he give unto mose , when he have make a end of commune with he upon mount sinai , two table of testimony , table of stone , write with the finger of god .
and when the people see that mose delay to come down out of the mount , the people gather themselves together unto aaron , and say unto he , up , make we god , which shall go before we ; for as for this moses , the man that bring we up out of the land of egypt , we wot not what be become of he .
and aaron say unto they , break off the golden earring , which be in the ear of you wife , of you son , and of you daughter , and bring they unto i .
and all the people brake off the golden earring which be in they ear , and bring they unto aaron .
and he receive they at they hand , and fashion it with a graving tool , after he have make it a molten calf : and they say , these be thy god , o israel , which bring thee up out of the land of egypt .
and when aaron see it , he build a altar before it ; and aaron make proclamation , and say , to morrow be a feast to the lord .
and they rise up early on the morrow , and offer burnt offering , and bring peace offering ; and the people sit down to eat and to drink , and rise up to play .
and the lord say unto mose , go , get thee down ; for thy people , which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt , have corrupt themselves :
they have turn aside quickly out of the way which i command they : they have make they a molten calf , and have worship it , and have sacrifice thereunto , and say , these be thy god , o israel , which have bring thee up out of the land of egypt .
and the lord say unto mose , i have see this people , and , behold , it be a stiffnecked people :
now therefore let i alone , that my wrath may wax hot against they , and that i may consume they : and i will make of thee a great nation .
and moses beseech the lord he god , and say , lord , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people , which thou hast bring forth out of the land of egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
wherefore should the egyptians speak , and say , for mischief do he bring they out , to slay they in the mountain , and to consume they from the face of the earth ?
turn from thy fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against thy people .
remember abraham , isaac , and israel , thy servant , to whom thou swarest by thine own self , and saidst unto they , i will multiply you seed as the star of heaven , and all this land that i have speak of will i give unto you seed , and they shall inherit it for ever .
and the lord repent of the evil which he think to do unto he people .
and moses turn , and go down from the mount , and the two table of the testimony be in he hand : the table be write on both they side ; on the one side and on the other be they write .
and the table be the work of god , and the writing be the writing of god , grave upon the table .
and when joshua hear the noise of the people as they shout , he say unto mose , there be a noise of war in the camp .
and he say , it be not the voice of they that shout for mastery , neither be it the voice of they that cry for be overcome : but the noise of they that sing do i hear .
and it come to pass , as soon as he come nigh unto the camp , that he see the calf , and the dancing : and moses ' anger wax hot , and he cast the table out of he hand , and brake they beneath the mount .
and he take the calf which they have make , and burn it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and straw it upon the water , and make the child of israel drink of it .
and moses say unto aaron , what do this people unto thee , that thou hast bring so great a sin upon they ?
and aaron say , let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they be set on mischief .
for they say unto i , make we god , which shall go before we : for as for this moses , the man that bring we up out of the land of egypt , we wot not what be become of he .
and i say unto they , whosoever have any gold , let they break it off .
so they give it i : then i cast it into the fire , and there come out this calf .
and when moses see that the people be naked ; ( for aaron have make they naked unto they shame among they enemy : )
then moses stand in the gate of the camp , and say , who be on the lord 's side ? let he come unto i .
and all the son of levi gather themselves together unto he .
and he say unto they , thus saith the lord god of israel , put every man he sword by he side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man he brother , and every man he companion , and every man he neighbour .
and the child of levi do accord to the word of moses : and there fall of the people that day about three thousand man .
for mose have say , consecrate yourselve today to the lord , even every man upon he son , and upon he brother ; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that mose say unto the people , ye have sin a great sin : and now i will go up unto the lord ; peradventure i shall make a atonement for you sin .
and moses return unto the lord , and say , oh , this people have sin a great sin , and have make they god of gold .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive they sin ; and if not , blot i , i pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast write .
and the lord say unto mose , whosoever have sin against i , he will i blot out of my book .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which i have speak unto thee : behold , mine angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit they sin upon they .
and the lord plague the people , because they make the calf , which aaron make .
and the lord say unto mose , depart , and go up hence , thou and the people which thou hast bring up out of the land of egypt , unto the land which i sware unto abraham , to isaac , and to jacob , say , unto thy seed will i give it :
and i will send a angel before thee ; and i will drive out the canaanite , the amorite , and the hittite , and the perizzite , the hivite , and the jebusite :
unto a land flow with milk and honey : for i will not go up in the midst of thee ; for thou art a stiffnecked people : lest i consume thee in the way .
and when the people hear these evil tiding , they mourn : and no man do put on he he ornament .
for the lord have say unto mose , say unto the child of israel , ye be a stiffnecked people : i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment , and consume thee : therefore now put off thy ornament from thee , that i may know what to do unto thee .
and the child of israel strip themselves of they ornament by the mount horeb .
and moses take the tabernacle , and pitch it without the camp , afar off from the camp , and call it the tabernacle of the congregation .
and it come to pass , that every one which seek the lord go out unto the tabernacle of the congregation , which be without the camp .
and it come to pass , when moses go out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rise up , and stand every man at he tent door , and look after moses , until he be go into the tabernacle .
and it come to pass , as moses enter into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descend , and stand at the door of the tabernacle , and the lord talk with mose .
and all the people see the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door : and all the people rise up and worship , every man in he tent door .
and the lord speak unto mose face to face , as a man speaketh unto he friend .
and he turn again into the camp : but he servant joshua , the son of nun , a young man , depart not out of the tabernacle .
and moses say unto the lord , see , thou sayest unto i , bring up this people : and thou hast not let i know whom thou wilt send with i .
yet thou hast say , i know thee by name , and thou hast also find grace in my sight .
now therefore , i pray thee , if i have find grace in thy sight , shew i now thy way , that i may know thee , that i may find grace in thy sight : and consider that this nation be thy people .
and he say , my presence shall go with thee , and i will give thee rest .
and he say unto he , if thy presence go not with i , carry we not up hence .
for wherein shall it be know here that i and thy people have find grace in thy sight ? be it not in that thou goest with we ? so shall we be separate , i and thy people , from all the people that be upon the face of the earth .
and the lord say unto mose , i will do this thing also that thou hast speak : for thou hast find grace in my sight , and i know thee by name .
and he say , i beseech thee , shew i thy glory .
and he say , i will make all my goodness pass before thee , and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee ; and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious , and will shew mercy on whom i will shew mercy .
and he say , thou canst not see my face : for there shall no man see i , and live .
and the lord say , behold , there be a place by i , and thou shalt stand upon a rock :
and it shall come to pass , while my glory passeth by , that i will put thee in a clift of the rock , and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by :
and i will take away mine hand , and thou shalt see my back part : but my face shall not be see .
and the lord say unto mose , hew thee two table of stone like unto the first : and i will write upon these table the word that be in the first table , which thou brakest .
and be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount sinai , and present thyself there to i in the top of the mount .
and no man shall come up with thee , neither let any man be see throughout all the mount ; neither let the flock nor herd feed before that mount .
and he hew two table of stone like unto the first ; and moses rise up early in the morning , and go up unto mount sinai , as the lord have command he , and take in he hand the two table of stone .
and the lord descend in the cloud , and stand with he there , and proclaim the name of the lord .
and the lord pass by before he , and proclaim , the lord , the lord god , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness and truth ,
keep mercy for thousand , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visit the iniquity of the father upon the child , and upon the child 's child , unto the third and to the fourth generation .
and moses make haste , and bow he head toward the earth , and worship .
and he say , if now i have find grace in thy sight , o lord , let my lord , i pray thee , go among we ; for it be a stiffnecked people ; and pardon we iniquity and we sin , and take we for thine inheritance .
and he say , behold , i make a covenant : before all thy people i will do marvel , such as have not be do in all the earth , nor in any nation : and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord : for it be a terrible thing that i will do with thee .
observe thou that which i command thee this day : behold , i drive out before thee the amorite , and the canaanite , and the hittite , and the perizzite , and the hivite , and the jebusite .
take heed to thyself , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
but ye shall destroy they altar , break they image , and cut down they grove :
for thou shalt worship no other god : for the lord , whose name be jealous , be a jealous god :
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land , and they go a whoring after they god , and do sacrifice unto they god , and one call thee , and thou eat of he sacrifice ;
and thou take of they daughter unto thy son , and they daughter go a whoring after they god , and make thy son go a whoring after they god .
thou shalt make thee no molten god .
the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep .
seven day thou shalt eat unleavened bread , as i command thee , in the time of the month abib : for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt .
all that openeth the matrix be mine ; and every firstling among thy cattle , whether ox or sheep , that be male .
but the firstling of a ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb : and if thou redeem he not , then shalt thou break he neck .
all the firstborn of thy son thou shalt redeem .
and none shall appear before i empty .
six day thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
and thou shalt observe the feast of week , of the firstfruit of wheat harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the year 's end .
thrice in the year shall all you menchildren appear before the lord god , the god of israel .
for i will cast out the nation before thee , and enlarge thy border : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be leave unto the morning .
the first of the firstfruit of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god .
thou shalt not seethe a kid in he mother 's milk .
and the lord say unto mose , write thou these word : for after the tenor of these word i have make a covenant with thee and with israel .
and he be there with the lord forty day and forty night ; he do neither eat bread , nor drink water .
and he write upon the table the word of the covenant , the ten commandment .
and it come to pass , when moses come down from mount sinai with the two table of testimony in moses ' hand , when he come down from the mount , that mose wist not that the skin of he face shone while he talk with he .
and when aaron and all the child of israel see moses , behold , the skin of he face shone ; and they be afraid to come nigh he .
and moses call unto they ; and aaron and all the ruler of the congregation return unto he : and moses talk with they .
and afterward all the child of israel come nigh : and he give they in commandment all that the lord have speak with he in mount sinai .
and till moses have do speak with they , he put a vail on he face .
but when moses go in before the lord to speak with he , he take the vail off , until he come out .

if the bright spot be white in the skin of he flesh , and in sight be not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turn white ; then the priest shall shut up he that have the plague seven day :
and the priest shall look on he the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague in he sight be at a stay , and the plague spread not in the skin ; then the priest shall shut he up seven day more :
and the priest shall look on he again the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague be somewhat dark , and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pronounce he clean : it be but a scab : and he shall wash he clothes , and be clean .

then the priest shall consider : and , behold , if the leprosy have cover all he flesh , he shall pronounce he clean that have the plague : it be all turn white : he be clean .
but when raw flesh appeareth in he , he shall be unclean .
and the priest shall see the raw flesh , and pronounce he to be unclean : for the raw flesh be unclean : it be a leprosy .
or if the raw flesh turn again , and be change unto white , he shall come unto the priest ;
and the priest shall see he : and , behold , if the plague be turn into white ; then the priest shall pronounce he clean that have the plague : he be clean .

and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the lord .

and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel , or of the stranger that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut he off from among he people .
for the life of the flesh be in the blood : and i have give it to you upon the altar to make a atonement for you soul : for it be the blood that maketh a atonement for the soul .
therefore i say unto the child of israel , no soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood .
and whatsoever man there be of the child of israel , or of the stranger that sojourn among you , which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eat ; he shall even pour out the blood thereof , and cover it with dust .
for it be the life of all flesh ; the blood of it be for the life thereof : therefore i say unto the child of israel , ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh : for the life of all flesh be the blood thereof : whosoever eateth it shall be cut off .
and every soul that eateth that which die of itself , or that which be tear with beast , whether it be one of you own country , or a stranger , he shall both wash he clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even : then shall he be clean .

neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith : neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto : it be confusion .
defile not ye yourselve in any of these thing : for in all these the nation be defile which i cast out before you :

ye shall therefore keep my statute and my judgment , and shall not commit any of these abomination ; neither any of you own nation , nor any stranger that sojourneth among you :
( for all these abomination have the man of the land do , which be before you , and the land be defile ; )

therefore every one that eateth it shall bear he iniquity , because he have profane the hallowed thing of the lord : and that soul shall be cut off from among he people .
and when ye reap the harvest of you land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest .
and thou shalt not glean thy vineyard , neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard ; thou shalt leave they for the poor and stranger : i be the lord you god .

and they put he in ward , that the mind of the lord might be shew they .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,

and he that killeth a beast shall make it good ; beast for beast .

ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger , as for one of you own country : for i be the lord you god .

and the lord speak unto mose in mount sinai , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye come into the land which i give you , then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord .
six year thou shalt sow thy field , and six year thou shalt prune thy vineyard , and gather in the fruit thereof ;
but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the lord : thou shalt neither sow thy field , nor prune thy vineyard .
that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grape of thy vine undress : for it be a year of rest unto the land .
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hire servant , and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee ,
and for thy cattle , and for the beast that be in thy land , shall all the increase thereof be meat .
and thou shalt number seven sabbath of year unto thee , seven time seven year ; and the space of the seven sabbath of year shall be unto thee forty and nine year .
then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all you land .
and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitant thereof : it shall be a jubile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto he possession , and ye shall return every man unto he family .
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grape in it of thy vine undressed .
for it be the jubile ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto he possession .
and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour , or buyest ought of thy neighbour 's hand , ye shall not oppress one another :
accord to the number of year after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour , and accord unto the number of year of the fruit he shall sell unto thee :
accord to the multitude of year thou shalt increase the price thereof , and accord to the fewness of year thou shalt diminish the price of it : for accord to the number of the year of the fruit doth he sell unto thee .
ye shall not therefore oppress one another ; but thou shalt fear thy god : for i be the lord you god .
wherefore ye shall do my statute , and keep my judgment , and do they ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
and the land shall yield she fruit , and ye shall eat you fill , and dwell therein in safety .
and if ye shall say , what shall we eat the seventh year ? behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in we increase :

and ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until she fruit come in ye shall eat of the old store .
the land shall not be sell for ever : for the land be mine ; for ye be stranger and sojourner with i .
and in all the land of you possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land .
if thy brother be waxen poor , and have sell away some of he possession , and if any of he kin come to redeem it , then shall he redeem that which he brother sell .
and if the man have none to redeem it , and himself be able to redeem it ;
then let he count the year of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sell it ; that he may return unto he possession .
but if he be not able to restore it to he , then that which be sell shall remain in the hand of he that have buy it until the year of jubile : and in the jubile it shall go out , and he shall return unto he possession .
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it be sell ; within a full year may he redeem it .
and if it be not redeem within the space of a full year , then the house that be in the walled city shall be establish for ever to he that buy it throughout he generation : it shall not go out in the jubile .
but the house of the village which have no wall round about they shall be count as the field of the country : they may be redeem , and they shall go out in the jubile .
notwithstanding the city of the levites , and the house of the city of they possession , may the levites redeem at any time .
and if a man purchase of the levites , then the house that be sell , and the city of he possession , shall go out in the year of jubile : for the house of the city of the levites be they possession among the child of israel .
but the field of the suburb of they city may not be sell ; for it be they perpetual possession .
and if thy brother be waxen poor , and fall in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve he : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
take thou no usury of he , or increase : but fear thy god ; that thy brother may live with thee .
thou shalt not give he thy money upon usury , nor lend he thy victuals for increase .
i be the lord you god , which bring you forth out of the land of egypt , to give you the land of canaan , and to be you god .
and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor , and be sell unto thee ; thou shalt not compel he to serve as a bondservant :
but as a hire servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile :
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and he child with he , and shall return unto he own family , and unto the possession of he father shall he return .
for they be my servant , which i bring forth out of the land of egypt : they shall not be sell as bondman .
thou shalt not rule over he with rigour ; but shalt fear thy god .
both thy bondmen , and thy bondmaid , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that be round about you ; of they shall ye buy bondman and bondmaid .
moreover of the child of the stranger that do sojourn among you , of they shall ye buy , and of they family that be with you , which they beget in you land : and they shall be you possession .
and ye shall take they as a inheritance for you child after you , to inherit they for a possession ; they shall be you bondman for ever : but over you brethren the child of israel , ye shall not rule one over another with rigour .
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwelleth by he wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger 's family :
after that he be sell he may be redeem again ; one of he brethren may redeem he :
either he uncle , or he uncle 's son , may redeem he , or any that be nigh of kin unto he of he family may redeem he ; or if he be able , he may redeem himself .
and he shall reckon with he that buy he from the year that he be sell to he unto the year of jubile : and the price of he sale shall be accord unto the number of year , accord to the time of a hire servant shall it be with he .
if there be yet many year behind , accord unto they he shall give again the price of he redemption out of the money that he be buy for .
and if there remain but few year unto the year of jubile , then he shall count with he , and accord unto he year shall he give he again the price of he redemption .
and as a yearly hire servant shall he be with he : and the other shall not rule with rigour over he in thy sight .
and if he be not redeem in these year , then he shall go out in the year of jubile , both he , and he child with he .
for unto i the child of israel be servant ; they be my servant whom i bring forth out of the land of egypt : i be the lord you god .
ye shall make you no idol nor graven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in you land , to bow down unto it : for i be the lord you god .
ye shall keep my sabbath , and reverence my sanctuary : i be the lord .
if ye walk in my statute , and keep my commandment , and do they ;
then i will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield she increase , and the tree of the field shall yield they fruit .
and you threshing shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time : and ye shall eat you bread to the full , and dwell in you land safely .
and i will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and i will rid evil beast out of the land , neither shall the sword go through you land .
and ye shall chase you enemy , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
and five of you shall chase a hundred , and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and you enemy shall fall before you by the sword .
for i will have respect unto you , and make you fruitful , and multiply you , and establish my covenant with you .
and ye shall eat old store , and bring forth the old because of the new .
and i will set my tabernacle among you : and my soul shall not abhor you .
and i will walk among you , and will be you god , and ye shall be my people .
i be the lord you god , which bring you forth out of the land of egypt , that ye should not be they bondman ; and i have break the band of you yoke , and make you go upright .
but if ye will not hearken unto i , and will not do all these commandment ;
and if ye shall despise my statute , or if you soul abhor my judgment , so that ye will not do all my commandment , but that ye break my covenant :
i also will do this unto you ; i will even appoint over you terror , consumption , and the burning ague , that shall consume the eye , and cause sorrow of heart : and ye shall sow you seed in vain , for you enemy shall eat it .
and i will set my face against you , and ye shall be slay before you enemy : they that hate you shall reign over you ; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you .
and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto i , then i will punish you seven time more for you sin .
and i will break the pride of you power ; and i will make you heaven as iron , and you earth as brass :
and you strength shall be spend in vain : for you land shall not yield she increase , neither shall the tree of the land yield they fruit .
and if ye walk contrary unto i , and will not hearken unto i ; i will bring seven time more plague upon you accord to you sin .
i will also send wild beast among you , which shall rob you of you child , and destroy you cattle , and make you few in number ; and you high way shall be desolate .
and if ye will not be reform by i by these thing , but will walk contrary unto i ;
then will i also walk contrary unto you , and will punish you yet seven time for you sin .
and i will bring a sword upon you , that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant : and when ye be gather together within you city , i will send the pestilence among you ; and ye shall be deliver into the hand of the enemy .
and when i have break the staff of you bread , ten woman shall bake you bread in one oven , and they shall deliver you you bread again by weight : and ye shall eat , and not be satisfy .
and if ye will not for all this hearken unto i , but walk contrary unto i ;
then i will walk contrary unto you also in fury ; and i , even i , will chastise you seven time for you sin .
and ye shall eat the flesh of you son , and the flesh of you daughter shall ye eat .
and i will destroy you high place , and cut down you image , and cast you carcase upon the carcase of you idol , and my soul shall abhor you .
and i will make you city waste , and bring you sanctuary unto desolation , and i will not smell the savour of you sweet odour .
and i will bring the land into desolation : and you enemy which dwell therein shall be astonish at it .
and i will scatter you among the heathen , and will draw out a sword after you : and you land shall be desolate , and you city waste .
then shall the land enjoy she sabbath , as long as it lieth desolate , and ye be in you enemy ' land ; even then shall the land rest , and enjoy she sabbath .
as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest ; because it do not rest in you sabbath , when ye dwelt upon it .
and upon they that be leave alive of you i will send a faintness into they heart in the land of they enemy ; and the sound of a shake leaf shall chase they ; and they shall flee , as flee from a sword ; and they shall fall when none pursueth .
and they shall fall one upon another , as it be before a sword , when none pursueth : and ye shall have no power to stand before you enemy .
and ye shall perish among the heathen , and the land of you enemy shall eat you up .
and they that be leave of you shall pine away in they iniquity in you enemy ' land ; and also in the iniquity of they father shall they pine away with they .
if they shall confess they iniquity , and the iniquity of they father , with they trespass which they trespass against i , and that also they have walk contrary unto i ;
and that i also have walk contrary unto they , and have bring they into the land of they enemy ; if then they uncircumcised heart be humble , and they then accept of the punishment of they iniquity :
then will i remember my covenant with jacob , and also my covenant with isaac , and also my covenant with abraham will i remember ; and i will remember the land .
the land also shall be leave of they , and shall enjoy she sabbath , while she lieth desolate without they : and they shall accept of the punishment of they iniquity : because , even because they despise my judgment , and because they soul abhor my statute .
and yet for all that , when they be in the land of they enemy , i will not cast they away , neither will i abhor they , to destroy they utterly , and to break my covenant with they : for i be the lord they god .
but i will for they sake remember the covenant of they ancestor , whom i bring forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the heathen , that i might be they god : i be the lord .

both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put they ; that they defile not they camp , in the midst whereof i dwell .
and the child of israel do so , and put they out without the camp : as the lord speak unto mose , so do the child of israel .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , when a man or woman shall commit any sin that man commit , to do a trespass against the lord , and that person be guilty ;
then they shall confess they sin which they have do : and he shall recompense he trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto he against whom he have trespass .
but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto , let the trespass be recompense unto the lord , even to the priest ; beside the ram of the atonement , whereby a atonement shall be make for he .
and every offering of all the holy thing of the child of israel , which they bring unto the priest , shall be he .
and every man 's hallowed thing shall be he : whatsoever any man giveth the priest , it shall be he .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,

and a man lie with she carnally , and it be hide from the eye of she husband , and be keep close , and she be defile , and there be no witness against she , neither she be take with the manner ;
and the spirit of jealousy come upon he , and he be jealous of he wife , and she be defile : or if the spirit of jealousy come upon he , and he be jealous of he wife , and she be not defile :
then shall the man bring he wife unto the priest , and he shall bring she offering for she , the tenth part of a ephah of barley meal ; he shall pour no oil upon it , nor put frankincense thereon ; for it be a offering of jealousy , a offering of memorial , bring iniquity to remembrance .
and the priest shall bring she near , and set she before the lord :
and the priest shall take holy water in a earthen vessel ; and of the dust that be in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put it into the water :
and the priest shall set the woman before the lord , and uncover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in she hand , which be the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in he hand the bitter water that causeth the curse :
and the priest shall charge she by a oath , and say unto the woman , if no man have lie with thee , and if thou hast not go aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse :
but if thou hast go aside to another instead of thy husband , and if thou be defile , and some man have lie with thee beside thine husband :
then the priest shall charge the woman with a oath of cursing , and the priest shall say unto the woman , the lord make thee a curse and a oath among thy people , when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot , and thy belly to swell ;
and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels , to make thy belly to swell , and thy thigh to rot : and the woman shall say , amen , aman .
and the priest shall write these curse in a book , and he shall blot they out with the bitter water :
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into she , and become bitter .
then the priest shall take the jealousy offer out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the lord , and offer it upon the altar :
and the priest shall take a handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .

and if the woman be not defile , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .

this be the law of the nazarite who have vow , and of he offering unto the lord for he separation , beside that that he hand shall get : accord to the vow which he vow , so he must do after the law of he separation .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto aaron and unto he son , say , on this wise ye shall bless the child of israel , say unto they ,
the lord bless thee , and keep thee :
the lord make he face shine upon thee , and be gracious unto thee :
the lord lift up he countenance upon thee , and give thee peace .
and they shall put my name upon the child of israel ; and i will bless they .

and they depart from the mount of the lord three day ' journey : and the ark of the covenant of the lord go before they in the three day ' journey , to search out a rest place for they .
and the cloud of the lord be upon they by day , when they go out of the camp .
and it come to pass , when the ark set forward , that moses say , rise up , lord , and let thine enemy be scatter ; and let they that hate thee flee before thee .
and when it rest , he say , return , o lord , unto the many thousand of israel .
and when the people complain , it displeased the lord : and the lord hear it ; and he anger be kindle ; and the fire of the lord burn among they , and consume they that be in the uttermost part of the camp .
and the people cry unto mose ; and when moses pray unto the lord , the fire be quench .
and he call the name of the place taberah : because the fire of the lord burn among they .
and the mixt multitude that be among they fall a lusting : and the child of israel also weep again , and say , who shall give we flesh to eat ?
we remember the fish , which we do eat in egypt freely ; the cucumber , and the melon , and the leek , and the onion , and the garlick :
but now we soul be dry away : there be nothing at all , beside this manna , before we eye .
and the manna be as coriander seed , and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium .
and the people go about , and gather it , and ground it in mill , or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in pan , and make cake of it : and the taste of it be as the taste of fresh oil .
and when the dew fall upon the camp in the night , the manna fall upon it .
then moses hear the people weep throughout they family , every man in the door of he tent : and the anger of the lord be kindle greatly ; moses also be displeased .
and moses say unto the lord , wherefore hast thou afflict thy servant ? and wherefore have i not find favour in thy sight , that thou layest the burden of all this people upon i ?
have i conceive all this people ? have i beget they , that thou shouldest say unto i , carry they in thy bosom , as a nursing father beareth the suck child , unto the land which thou swarest unto they father ?
whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people ? for they weep unto i , say , give we flesh , that we may eat .
i be not able to bear all this people alone , because it be too heavy for i .
and if thou deal thus with i , kill i , i pray thee , out of hand , if i have find favour in thy sight ; and let i not see my wretchedness .
and the lord say unto mose , gather unto i seventy man of the elder of israel , whom thou knowest to be the elder of the people , and officer over they ; and bring they unto the tabernacle of the congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
and i will come down and talk with thee there : and i will take of the spirit which be upon thee , and will put it upon they ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thyself alone .
and say thou unto the people , sanctify yourselve against to morrow , and ye shall eat flesh : for ye have weep in the ear of the lord , say , who shall give we flesh to eat ? for it be well with we in egypt : therefore the lord will give you flesh , and ye shall eat .
ye shall not eat one day , nor two day , nor five day , neither ten day , nor twenty day ;
but even a whole month , until it come out at you nostril , and it be loathsome unto you : because that ye have despise the lord which be among you , and have weep before he , say , why come we forth out of egypt ?
and moses say , the people , among whom i be , be six hundred thousand footman ; and thou hast say , i will give they flesh , that they may eat a whole month .
shall the flock and the herd be slay for they , to suffice they ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gather together for they , to suffice they ?
and the lord say unto mose , be the lord 's hand wax short ? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not .
and moses go out , and tell the people the word of the lord , and gather the seventy man of the elder of the people , and set they round about the tabernacle .
and the lord come down in a cloud , and spake unto he , and take of the spirit that be upon he , and give it unto the seventy elder : and it come to pass , that , when the spirit rest upon they , they prophesy , and do not cease .
but there remain two of the man in the camp , the name of the one be eldad , and the name of the other medad : and the spirit rest upon they ; and they be of they that be write , but go not out unto the tabernacle : and they prophesy in the camp .
and there run a young man , and tell moses , and say , eldad and medad do prophesy in the camp .
and joshua the son of nun , the servant of moses , one of he young man , answer and say , my lord moses , forbid they .
and moses say unto he , enviest thou for my sake ? would god that all the lord 's people be prophet , and that the lord would put he spirit upon they !
and moses gat he into the camp , he and the elder of israel .
and there go forth a wind from the lord , and bring quail from the sea , and let they fall by the camp , as it be a day 's journey on this side , and as it be a day 's journey on the other side , round about the camp , and as it be two cubit high upon the face of the earth .
and the people stand up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gather the quail : he that gather least gather ten homer : and they spread they all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and while the flesh be yet between they tooth , ere it be chew , the wrath of the lord be kindle against the people , and the lord smite the people with a very great plague .
and he call the name of that place kibrothhattaavah : because there they bury the people that lust .
and the people journey from kibrothhattaavah unto hazeroth ; and abode at hazeroth .
and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he have marry : for he have marry a ethiopian woman .
and they say , have the lord indeed speak only by moses ? have he not speak also by we ?
and the lord hear it .
( now the man moses be very meek , above all the man which be upon the face of the earth . )
and the lord spake suddenly unto moses , and unto aaron , and unto miriam , come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation .
and they three come out .
and the lord come down in the pillar of the cloud , and stand in the door of the tabernacle , and call aaron and miriam : and they both come forth .
and he say , hear now my word : if there be a prophet among you , i the lord will make myself know unto he in a vision , and will speak unto he in a dream .
my servant moses be not so , who be faithful in all mine house .
with he will i speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speech ; and the similitude of the lord shall he behold : wherefore then be ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses ?
and the anger of the lord be kindle against they ; and he depart .
and the cloud depart from off the tabernacle ; and , behold , miriam become leprous , white as snow : and aaron look upon miriam , and , behold , she be leprous .
and aaron say unto mose , alas , my lord , i beseech thee , lay not the sin upon we , wherein we have do foolishly , and wherein we have sin .
let she not be as one dead , of whom the flesh be half consume when he cometh out of he mother 's womb .
and moses cry unto the lord , say , heal she now , o god , i beseech thee .
and the lord say unto mose , if she father have but spit in she face , should she not be ashamed seven day ? let she be shut out from the camp seven day , and after that let she be receive in again .
and miriam be shut out from the camp seven day : and the people journey not till miriam be bring in again .
and afterward the people remove from hazeroth , and pitch in the wilderness of paran .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
send thou man , that they may search the land of canaan , which i give unto the child of israel : of every tribe of they father shall ye send a man , every one a ruler among they .
and moses by the commandment of the lord send they from the wilderness of paran : all those man be head of the child of israel .
and these be they name : of the tribe of reuben , shammua the son of zaccur .
of the tribe of simeon , shaphat the son of hori .
of the tribe of judah , caleb the son of jephunneh .
of the tribe of issachar , igal the son of joseph .
of the tribe of ephraim , oshea the son of nun .
of the tribe of benjamin , palti the son of raphu .
of the tribe of zebulun , gaddiel the son of sodi .
of the tribe of joseph , namely , of the tribe of manasseh , gaddi the son of susi .
of the tribe of dan , ammiel the son of gemalli .
of the tribe of asher , sethur the son of michael .
of the tribe of naphtali , nahbi the son of vophsus .
of the tribe of gad , geuel the son of machi .
these be the name of the man which moses send to spy out the land .
and moses call oshea the son of nun jehoshua .
and moses send they to spy out the land of canaan , and say unto they , get you up this way southward , and go up into the mountain :
and see the land , what it be ; and the people that dwelleth therein , whether they be strong or weak , few or many ;
and what the land be that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad ; and what city they be that they dwell in , whether in tent , or in strong hold ;
and what the land be , whether it be fat or lean , whether there be wood therein , or not .
and be ye of good courage , and bring of the fruit of the land .
now the time be the time of the firstripe grape .
so they go up , and search the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob , as man come to hamath .
and they ascend by the south , and come unto hebron ; where ahiman , sheshai , and talmai , the child of anak , be .
( now hebron be build seven year before zoan in egypt . )
and they come unto the brook of eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grape , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they bring of the pomegranate , and of the fig .
the place be call the brook eshcol , because of the cluster of grape which the child of israel cut down from thence .
and they return from search of the land after forty day .
and they go and come to moses , and to aaron , and to all the congregation of the child of israel , unto the wilderness of paran , to kadesh ; and bring back word unto they , and unto all the congregation , and shew they the fruit of the land .
and they tell he , and say , we come unto the land whither thou sentest we , and surely it floweth with milk and honey ; and this be the fruit of it .
nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land , and the city be wall , and very great : and moreover we see the child of anak there .
the amalekites dwell in the land of the south : and the hittites , and the jebusites , and the amorites , dwell in the mountain : and the canaanites dwell by the sea , and by the coast of jordan .
and caleb still the people before mose , and say , let we go up at once , and possess it ; for we be well able to overcome it .
but the man that go up with he say , we be not able to go up against the people ; for they be stronger than we .
and they bring up a evil report of the land which they have search unto the child of israel , say , the land , through which we have go to search it , be a land that eateth up the inhabitant thereof ; and all the people that we see in it be man of a great stature .
and there we see the giant , the son of anak , which come of the giant : and we be in we own sight as grasshopper , and so we be in they sight .
and all the congregation lift up they voice , and cry ; and the people weep that night .
and all the child of israel murmur against moses and against aaron : and the whole congregation say unto they , would god that we have die in the land of egypt ! or would god we have die in this wilderness !
and wherefore have the lord bring we unto this land , to fall by the sword , that we wife and we child should be a prey ? be it not better for we to return into egypt ?
and they say one to another , let we make a captain , and let we return into egypt .
then moses and aaron fall on they face before all the assembly of the congregation of the child of israel .
and joshua the son of nun , and caleb the son of jephunneh , which be of they that search the land , rent they clothes :
and they speak unto all the company of the child of israel , say , the land , which we pass through to search it , be a exceed good land .
if the lord delight in we , then he will bring we into this land , and give it we ; a land which floweth with milk and honey .
only rebel not ye against the lord , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they be bread for we : they defence be depart from they , and the lord be with we : fear they not .
but all the congregation bid stone they with stone .
and the glory of the lord appear in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the child of israel .
and the lord say unto mose , how long will this people provoke i ? and how long will it be ere they believe i , for all the sign which i have shew among they ?
i will smite they with the pestilence , and disinherit they , and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they .
and moses say unto the lord , then the egyptians shall hear it , ( for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among they ; )
and they will tell it to the inhabitant of this land : for they have hear that thou lord art among this people , that thou lord art see face to face , and that thy cloud standeth over they , and that thou goest before they , by day time in a pillar of a cloud , and in a pillar of fire by night .
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nation which have hear the fame of thee will speak , say ,
because the lord be not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto they , therefore he have slay they in the wilderness .
and now , i beseech thee , let the power of my lord be great , accord as thou hast speak , say ,
the lord be longsuffer , and of great mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression , and by no means clear the guilty , visit the iniquity of the father upon the child unto the third and fourth generation .
pardon , i beseech thee , the iniquity of this people accord unto the greatness of thy mercy , and as thou hast forgive this people , from egypt even until now .
and the lord say , i have pardon accord to thy word :
but as truly as i live , all the earth shall be fill with the glory of the lord .
because all those man which have see my glory , and my miracle , which i do in egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempt i now these ten time , and have not hearken to my voice ;
surely they shall not see the land which i sware unto they father , neither shall any of they that provoke i see it :
but my servant caleb , because he have another spirit with he , and have follow i fully , he will i bring into the land whereinto he go ; and he seed shall possess it .
( now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valley . )
tomorrow turn you , and get you into the wilderness by the way of the red sea .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
how long shall i bear with this evil congregation , which murmur against i ?
i have hear the murmuring of the child of israel , which they murmur against i .
say unto they , as truly as i live , saith the lord , as ye have speak in mine ear , so will i do to you :
you carcase shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that be number of you , accord to you whole number , from twenty year old and upward , which have murmur against i ,
doubtless ye shall not come into the land , concern which i sware to make you dwell therein , save caleb the son of jephunneh , and joshua the son of nun .
but you little one , which ye say should be a prey , they will i bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have despise .
but as for you , you carcase , they shall fall in this wilderness .
and you child shall wander in the wilderness forty year , and bear you whoredom , until you carcase be waste in the wilderness .
after the number of the day in which ye search the land , even forty day , each day for a year , shall ye bear you iniquity , even forty year , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
i the lord have say , i will surely do it unto all this evil congregation , that be gather together against i : in this wilderness they shall be consume , and there they shall die .
and the man , which moses send to search the land , who return , and make all the congregation to murmur against he , by bring up a slander upon the land ,
even those man that do bring up the evil report upon the land , die by the plague before the lord .
but joshua the son of nun , and caleb the son of jephunneh , which be of the man that go to search the land , live still .
and moses tell these saying unto all the child of israel : and the people mourn greatly .
and they rise up early in the morning , and gat they up into the top of the mountain , say , lo , we be here , and will go up unto the place which the lord have promise : for we have sin .
and moses say , wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the lord ? but it shall not prosper .
go not up , for the lord be not among you ; that ye be not smite before you enemy .
for the amalekites and the canaanites be there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword : because ye be turn away from the lord , therefore the lord will not be with you .
but they presume to go up unto the hill top : nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the lord , and moses , depart not out of the camp .
then the amalekites come down , and the canaanites which dwell in that hill , and smite they , and discomfited they , even unto hormah .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye be come into the land of you habitation , which i give unto you ,
and will make a offering by fire unto the lord , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice in perform a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in you solemn feast , to make a sweet savour unto the lord , of the herd , or of the flock :
then shall he that offereth he offering unto the lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingle with the fourth part of a hin of oil .
and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice , for one lamb .
or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offer two tenth deal of flour mingle with the third part of a hin of oil .
and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine , for a sweet savour unto the lord .
and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in perform a vow , or peace offering unto the lord :
then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deal of flour mingle with half a hin of oil .
and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half a hin of wine , for a offering make by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
thus shall it be do for one bullock , or for one ram , or for a lamb , or a kid .
accord to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do to every one accord to they number .
all that be bear of the country shall do these thing after this manner , in offer a offering make by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
and if a stranger sojourn with you , or whosoever be among you in you generation , and will offer a offering make by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord ; as ye do , so he shall do .
one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation , and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you , a ordinance for ever in you generation : as ye be , so shall the stranger be before the lord .
one law and one manner shall be for you , and for the stranger that sojourneth with you .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye come into the land whither i bring you ,
then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up a heave offering unto the lord .
ye shall offer up a cake of the first of you dough for a heave offering : as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor , so shall ye heave it .
of the first of you dough ye shall give unto the lord a heave offering in you generation .
and if ye have err , and not observe all these commandment , which the lord have speak unto mose ,
even all that the lord have command you by the hand of moses , from the day that the lord command moses , and henceforward among you generation ;
then it shall be , if ought be commit by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation , that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour unto the lord , with he meat offering , and he drink offering , accord to the manner , and one kid of the goat for a sin offering .
and the priest shall make a atonement for all the congregation of the child of israel , and it shall be forgive they ; for it be ignorance : and they shall bring they offering , a sacrifice make by fire unto the lord , and they sin offering before the lord , for they ignorance :
and it shall be forgive all the congregation of the child of israel , and the stranger that sojourneth among they ; see all the people be in ignorance .
and if any soul sin through ignorance , then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering .
and the priest shall make a atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord , to make a atonement for he ; and it shall be forgive he .
ye shall have one law for he that sinneth through ignorance , both for he that be bear among the child of israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among they .
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be bear in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from among he people .
because he have despise the word of the lord , and have break he commandment , that soul shall utterly be cut off ; he iniquity shall be upon he .
and while the child of israel be in the wilderness , they find a man that gather stick upon the sabbath day .
and they that find he gather stick bring he unto mose and aaron , and unto all the congregation .
and they put he in ward , because it be not declare what should be do to he .
and the lord say unto mose , the man shall be surely put to death : all the congregation shall stone he with stone without the camp .
and all the congregation bring he without the camp , and stone he with stone , and he die ; as the lord command moses .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and bid they that they make they fringe in the border of they garment throughout they generation , and that they put upon the fringe of the border a ribband of blue :
and it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the commandment of the lord , and do they ; and that ye seek not after you own heart and you own eye , after which ye use to go a whoring :
that ye may remember , and do all my commandment , and be holy unto you god .
i be the lord you god , which bring you out of the land of egypt , to be you god : i be the lord you god .
now korah , the son of izhar , the son of kohath , the son of levi , and dathan and abiram , the son of eliab , and on , the son of peleth , son of reuben , take man :
and they rise up before moses , with certain of the child of israel , two hundred and fifty prince of the assembly , famous in the congregation , man of renown :
and they gather themselves together against moses and against aaron , and say unto they , ye take too much upon you , see all the congregation be holy , every one of they , and the lord be among they : wherefore then lift ye up yourselve above the congregation of the lord ?
and when moses hear it , he fall upon he face :
and he speak unto korah and unto all he company , say , even to morrow the lord will shew who be he , and who be holy ; and will cause he to come near unto he : even he whom he have choose will he cause to come near unto he .
this do ; take you censer , korah , and all he company ;
and put fire therein , and put incense in they before the lord to morrow : and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose , he shall be holy : ye take too much upon you , ye son of levi .
and moses say unto korah , hear , i pray you , ye son of levi :
seemeth it but a small thing unto you , that the god of israel have separate you from the congregation of israel , to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto they ?
and he have bring thee near to he , and all thy brethren the son of levi with thee : and seek ye the priesthood also ?
for which cause both thou and all thy company be gather together against the lord : and what be aaron , that ye murmur against he ?
and moses send to call dathan and abiram , the son of eliab : which say , we will not come up :
be it a small thing that thou hast bring we up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill we in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over we ?
moreover thou hast not bring we into a land that floweth with milk and honey , or give we inheritance of field and vineyard : wilt thou put out the eye of these man ? we will not come up .
and moses be very wroth , and say unto the lord , respect not thou they offering : i have not take one ass from they , neither have i hurt one of they .
and moses say unto korah , be thou and all thy company before the lord , thou , and they , and aaron , to morrow :
and take every man he censer , and put incense in they , and bring ye before the lord every man he censer , two hundred and fifty censer ; thou also , and aaron , each of you he censer .
and they take every man he censer , and put fire in they , and lay incense thereon , and stand in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with mose and aaron .
and korah gather all the congregation against they unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and the glory of the lord appear unto all the congregation .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
separate yourselve from among this congregation , that i may consume they in a moment .
and they fall upon they face , and say , o god , the god of the spirit of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation ?
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the congregation , say , get you up from about the tabernacle of korah , dathan , and abiram .
and moses rise up and go unto dathan and abiram ; and the elder of israel follow he .
and he speak unto the congregation , say , depart , i pray you , from the tent of these wicked man , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consume in all they sin .
so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah , dathan , and abiram , on every side : and dathan and abiram come out , and stand in the door of they tent , and they wife , and they son , and they little child .
and moses say , hereby ye shall know that the lord have send i to do all these work ; for i have not do they of mine own mind .
if these man die the common death of all man , or if they be visit after the visitation of all man ; then the lord have not send i .
but if the lord make a new thing , and the earth open she mouth , and swallow they up , with all that appertain unto they , and they go down quick into the pit ; then ye shall understand that these man have provoke the lord .
and it come to pass , as he have make a end of speak all these word , that the ground clave asunder that be under they :
and the earth open she mouth , and swallow they up , and they house , and all the man that appertain unto korah , and all they goods .
they , and all that appertain to they , go down alive into the pit , and the earth close upon they : and they perish from among the congregation .
and all israel that be round about they flee at the cry of they : for they say , lest the earth swallow we up also .
and there come out a fire from the lord , and consume the two hundred and fifty man that offer incense .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest , that he take up the censer out of the burning , and scatter thou the fire yonder ; for they be hallowed .
the censer of these sinner against they own soul , let they make they broad plate for a covering of the altar : for they offer they before the lord , therefore they be hallowed : and they shall be a sign unto the child of israel .
and eleazar the priest take the brasen censer , wherewith they that be burn have offer ; and they be make broad plate for a covering of the altar :
to be a memorial unto the child of israel , that no stranger , which be not of the seed of aaron , come near to offer incense before the lord ; that he be not as korah , and as he company : as the lord say to he by the hand of moses .
but on the morrow all the congregation of the child of israel murmur against moses and against aaron , say , ye have kill the people of the lord .
and it come to pass , when the congregation be gather against moses and against aaron , that they look toward the tabernacle of the congregation : and , behold , the cloud cover it , and the glory of the lord appear .
and moses and aaron come before the tabernacle of the congregation .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
get you up from among this congregation , that i may consume they as in a moment .
and they fall upon they face .
and moses say unto aaron , take a censer , and put fire therein from off the altar , and put on incense , and go quickly unto the congregation , and make a atonement for they : for there be wrath go out from the lord ; the plague be begin .
and aaron take as moses command , and run into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague be begin among the people : and he put on incense , and make a atonement for the people .
and he stand between the dead and the living ; and the plague be stay .
now they that die in the plague be fourteen thousand and seven hundred , beside they that die about the matter of korah .
and aaron return unto mose unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and the plague be stay .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and take of every one of they a rod accord to the house of they father , of all they prince accord to the house of they father twelve rod : write thou every man 's name upon he rod .
and thou shalt write aaron 's name upon the rod of levi : for one rod shall be for the head of the house of they father .
and thou shalt lay they up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony , where i will meet with you .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's rod , whom i shall choose , shall blossom : and i will make to cease from i the murmuring of the child of israel , whereby they murmur against you .
and moses spake unto the child of israel , and every one of they prince give he a rod apiece , for each prince one , accord to they father ' house , even twelve rod : and the rod of aaron be among they rod .
and moses lay up the rod before the lord in the tabernacle of witness .
and it come to pass , that on the morrow moses go into the tabernacle of witness ; and , behold , the rod of aaron for the house of levi be bud , and bring forth bud , and bloom blossom , and yield almond .
and moses bring out all the rod from before the lord unto all the child of israel : and they look , and take every man he rod .
and the lord say unto mose , bring aaron 's rod again before the testimony , to be keep for a token against the rebel ; and thou shalt quite take away they murmuring from i , that they die not .
and moses do so : as the lord command he , so do he .
and the child of israel spake unto moses , say , behold , we die , we perish , we all perish .
whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord shall die : shall we be consume with die ?
and the lord say unto aaron , thou and thy son and thy father 's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary : and thou and thy son with thee shall bear the iniquity of you priesthood .
and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be join unto thee , and minister unto thee : but thou and thy son with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness .
and they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessel of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and they shall be join unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , for all the service of the tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you .
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary , and the charge of the altar : that there be no wrath any more upon the child of israel .
and i , behold , i have take you brethren the levites from among the child of israel : to you they be give as a gift for the lord , to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
therefore thou and thy son with thee shall keep you priest 's office for everything of the altar , and within the vail ; and ye shall serve : i have give you priest 's office unto you as a service of gift : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
and the lord spake unto aaron , behold , i also have give thee the charge of mine heave offering of all the hallowed thing of the child of israel ; unto thee have i give they by reason of the anointing , and to thy son , by a ordinance for ever .
this shall be thine of the most holy thing , reserve from the fire : every oblation of theirs , every meat offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto i , shall be most holy for thee and for thy son .
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it ; every male shall eat it : it shall be holy unto thee .
and this be thine ; the heave offering of they gift , with all the wave offering of the child of israel : i have give they unto thee , and to thy son and to thy daughter with thee , by a statute for ever : every one that be clean in thy house shall eat of it .
all the best of the oil , and all the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the firstfruit of they which they shall offer unto the lord , they have i give thee .
and whatsoever be first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the lord , shall be thine ; every one that be clean in thine house shall eat of it .
every thing devote in israel shall be thine .
every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh , which they bring unto the lord , whether it be of man or beast , shall be thine : nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem , and the firstling of unclean beast shalt thou redeem .
and those that be to be redeem from a month old shalt thou redeem , accord to thine estimation , for the money of five shekel , after the shekel of the sanctuary , which be twenty gerah .
but the firstling of a cow , or the firstling of a sheep , or the firstling of a goat , thou shalt not redeem ; they be holy : thou shalt sprinkle they blood upon the altar , and shalt burn they fat for a offering make by fire , for a sweet savour unto the lord .
and the flesh of they shall be thine , as the wave breast and as the right shoulder be thine .
all the heave offering of the holy thing , which the child of israel offer unto the lord , have i give thee , and thy son and thy daughter with thee , by a statute for ever : it be a covenant of salt for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee .
and the lord spake unto aaron , thou shalt have no inheritance in they land , neither shalt thou have any part among they : i be thy part and thine inheritance among the child of israel .
and , behold , i have give the child of levi all the tenth in israel for a inheritance , for they service which they serve , even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
neither must the child of israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation , lest they bear sin , and die .
but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they shall bear they iniquity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout you generation , that among the child of israel they have no inheritance .
but the tithe of the child of israel , which they offer as a heave offering unto the lord , i have give to the levites to inherit : therefore i have say unto they , among the child of israel they shall have no inheritance .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
thus speak unto the levites , and say unto they , when ye take of the child of israel the tithe which i have give you from they for you inheritance , then ye shall offer up a heave offering of it for the lord , even a tenth part of the tithe .
and this you heave offering shall be reckon unto you , as though it be the corn of the threshingfloor , and as the fulness of the winepress .
thus ye also shall offer a heave offering unto the lord of all you tithe , which ye receive of the child of israel ; and ye shall give thereof the lord 's heave offering to aaron the priest .
out of all you gift ye shall offer every heave offering of the lord , of all the best thereof , even the hallowed part thereof out of it .
therefore thou shalt say unto they , when ye have heave the best thereof from it , then it shall be count unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor , and as the increase of the winepress .
and ye shall eat it in every place , ye and you household : for it be you reward for you service in the tabernacle of the congregation .
and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it , when ye have heave from it the best of it : neither shall ye pollute the holy thing of the child of israel , lest ye die .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
this be the ordinance of the law which the lord have command , say , speak unto the child of israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without spot , wherein be no blemish , and upon which never come yoke :
and ye shall give she unto eleazar the priest , that he may bring she forth without the camp , and one shall slay she before he face :
and eleazar the priest shall take of she blood with he finger , and sprinkle of she blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven time :
and one shall burn the heifer in he sight ; she skin , and she flesh , and she blood , with she dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash he clothes , and he shall bathe he flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and he that burneth she shall wash he clothes in water , and bathe he flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the even .
and a man that be clean shall gather up the ash of the heifer , and lay they up without the camp in a clean place , and it shall be keep for the congregation of the child of israel for a water of separation : it be a purification for sin .
and he that gathereth the ash of the heifer shall wash he clothes , and be unclean until the even : and it shall be unto the child of israel , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among they , for a statute for ever .
he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven day .
he shall purify himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he purify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that be dead , and purifieth not himself , defileth the tabernacle of the lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from israel : because the water of separation be not sprinkle upon he , he shall be unclean ; he uncleanness be yet upon he .
this be the law , when a man dieth in a tent : all that come into the tent , and all that be in the tent , shall be unclean seven day .
and every open vessel , which have no cover bind upon it , be unclean .
and whosoever toucheth one that be slay with a sword in the open field , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven day .
and for a unclean person they shall take of the ash of the burnt heifer of purification for sin , and run water shall be put thereto in a vessel :
and a clean person shall take hyssop , and dip it in the water , and sprinkle it upon the tent , and upon all the vessel , and upon the person that be there , and upon he that touch a bone , or one slay , or one dead , or a grave :
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify himself , and wash he clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
but the man that shall be unclean , and shall not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation , because he have defile the sanctuary of the lord : the water of separation have not be sprinkle upon he ; he be unclean .
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto they , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash he clothes ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even .
and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean ; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even .
then come the child of israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of zin in the first month : and the people abide in kadesh ; and miriam die there , and be bury there .
and there be no water for the congregation : and they gather themselves together against moses and against aaron .
and the people chode with mose , and spake , say , would god that we have die when we brethren die before the lord !
and why have ye bring up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness , that we and we cattle should die there ?
and wherefore have ye make we to come up out of egypt , to bring we in unto this evil place ? it be no place of seed , or of fig , or of vine , or of pomegranate ; neither be there any water to drink .
and moses and aaron go from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they fall upon they face : and the glory of the lord appear unto they .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
take the rod , and gather thou the assembly together , thou , and aaron thy brother , and speak ye unto the rock before they eye ; and it shall give forth he water , and thou shalt bring forth to they water out of the rock : so thou shalt give the congregation and they beast drink .
and moses take the rod from before the lord , as he command he .
and moses and aaron gather the congregation together before the rock , and he say unto they , hear now , ye rebel ; must we fetch you water out of this rock ?
and mose lift up he hand , and with he rod he smite the rock twice : and the water come out abundantly , and the congregation drink , and they beast also .
and the lord speak unto mose and aaron , because ye believe i not , to sanctify i in the eye of the child of israel , therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have give they .
this be the water of meribah ; because the child of israel strive with the lord , and he be sanctify in they .
and moses send messenger from kadesh unto the king of edom , thus saith thy brother israel , thou knowest all the travail that have befall we :
how we father go down into egypt , and we have dwell in egypt a long time ; and the egyptians vex we , and we father :
and when we cry unto the lord , he hear we voice , and send a angel , and have bring we forth out of egypt : and , behold , we be in kadesh , a city in the uttermost of thy border :
let we pass , i pray thee , through thy country : we will not pass through the field , or through the vineyard , neither will we drink of the water of the well : we will go by the king 's high way , we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left , until we have pass thy border .
and edom say unto he , thou shalt not pass by i , lest i come out against thee with the sword .
and the child of israel say unto he , we will go by the high way : and if i and my cattle drink of thy water , then i will pay for it : i will only , without do anything else , go through on my foot .
and he say , thou shalt not go through .
and edom come out against he with much people , and with a strong hand .
thus edom refuse to give israel passage through he border : wherefore israel turn away from he .
and the child of israel , even the whole congregation , journey from kadesh , and come unto mount hor .
and the lord speak unto mose and aaron in mount hor , by the coast of the land of edom , say ,
aaron shall be gather unto he people : for he shall not enter into the land which i have give unto the child of israel , because ye rebel against my word at the water of meribah .
take aaron and eleazar he son , and bring they up unto mount hor :
and strip aaron of he garment , and put they upon eleazar he son : and aaron shall be gather unto he people , and shall die there .
and moses do as the lord command : and they go up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation .
and moses strip aaron of he garment , and put they upon eleazar he son ; and aaron die there in the top of the mount : and moses and eleazar come down from the mount .
and when all the congregation see that aaron be dead , they mourn for aaron thirty day , even all the house of israel .
and when king arad the canaanite , which dwell in the south , hear tell that israel come by the way of the spy ; then he fight against israel , and take some of they prisoner .
and israel vow a vow unto the lord , and say , if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand , then i will utterly destroy they city .
and the lord hearken to the voice of israel , and deliver up the canaanites ; and they utterly destroy they and they city : and he call the name of the place hormah .
and they journey from mount hor by the way of the red sea , to compass the land of edom : and the soul of the people be much discourage because of the way .
and the people speak against god , and against moses , wherefore have ye bring we up out of egypt to die in the wilderness ? for there be no bread , neither be there any water ; and we soul loatheth this light bread .
and the lord send fiery serpent among the people , and they bite the people ; and much people of israel die .
therefore the people come to moses , and say , we have sin , for we have speak against the lord , and against thee ; pray unto the lord , that he take away the serpent from we .
and moses pray for the people .
and the lord say unto moses , make thee a fiery serpent , and set it upon a pole : and it shall come to pass , that every one that be bite , when he looketh upon it , shall live .
and moses make a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole , and it come to pass , that if a serpent have bite any man , when he behold the serpent of brass , he live .
and the child of israel set forward , and pitch in oboth .
and they journey from oboth , and pitch at ijeabarim , in the wilderness which be before moab , toward the sunrising .
from thence they remove , and pitch in the valley of zared .
from thence they remove , and pitch on the other side of arnon , which be in the wilderness that cometh out of the coast of the amorites : for arnon be the border of moab , between moab and the amorites .
wherefore it be say in the book of the war of the lord , what he do in the red sea , and in the brook of arnon ,
and at the stream of the brook that goeth down to the dwelling of ar , and lieth upon the border of moab .
and from thence they go to beer : that be the well whereof the lord speak unto mose , gather the people together , and i will give they water .
then israel sing this song , spring up , o well ; sing ye unto it :
the prince dig the well , the noble of the people dig it , by the direction of the lawgiver , with they stave .
and from the wilderness they go to mattanah :
and from mattanah to nahaliel : and from nahaliel to bamoth :
and from bamoth in the valley , that be in the country of moab , to the top of pisgah , which looketh toward jeshimon .
and israel send messenger unto sihon king of the amorites , say ,
let i pass through thy land : we will not turn into the field , or into the vineyard ; we will not drink of the water of the well : but we will go along by the king 's high way , until we be past thy border .
and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through he border : but sihon gather all he people together , and go out against israel into the wilderness : and he come to jahaz , and fight against israel .
and israel smite he with the edge of the sword , and possess he land from arnon unto jabbok , even unto the child of ammon : for the border of the child of ammon be strong .
and israel take all these city : and israel dwelt in all the city of the amorites , in heshbon , and in all the village thereof .
for heshbon be the city of sihon the king of the amorites , who have fight against the former king of moab , and take all he land out of he hand , even unto arnon .
wherefore they that speak in proverb say , come into heshbon , let the city of sihon be build and prepare :
for there be a fire go out of heshbon , a flame from the city of sihon : it have consume ar of moab , and the lord of the high place of arnon .
woe to thee , moab ! thou art undo , o people of chemosh : he have give he son that escape , and he daughter , into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites .
we have shoot at they ; heshbon be perish even unto dibon , and we have lay they waste even unto nophah , which reacheth unto medeba .
thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites .
and moses send to spy out jaazer , and they take the village thereof , and drive out the amorites that be there .
and they turn and go up by the way of bashan : and og the king of bashan go out against they , he , and all he people , to the battle at edrei .
and the lord say unto mose , fear he not : for i have deliver he into thy hand , and all he people , and he land ; and thou shalt do to he as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites , which dwell at heshbon .
so they smite he , and he son , and all he people , until there be none leave he alive : and they possess he land .
and the child of israel set forward , and pitch in the plain of moab on this side jordan by jericho .
and balak the son of zippor see all that israel have do to the amorites .
and moab be sore afraid of the people , because they be many : and moab be distressed because of the child of israel .
and moab say unto the elder of midian , now shall this company lick up all that be round about we , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field .
and balak the son of zippor be king of the moabite at that time .
he send messenger therefore unto balaam the son of beor to pethor , which be by the river of the land of the child of he people , to call he , say , behold , there be a people come out from egypt : behold , they cover the face of the earth , and they abide over against i :
come now therefore , i pray thee , curse i this people ; for they be too mighty for i : peradventure i shall prevail , that we may smite they , and that i may drive they out of the land : for i wot that he whom thou blessest be bless , and he whom thou cursest be curse .
and the elder of moab and the elder of midian depart with the reward of divination in they hand ; and they come unto balaam , and spake unto he the word of balak .
and he say unto they , lodge here this night , and i will bring you word again , as the lord shall speak unto i : and the prince of moab abode with balaam .
and god come unto balaam , and say , what man be these with thee ?
and balaam say unto god , balak the son of zippor , king of moab , have send unto i , say ,
behold , there be a people come out of egypt , which covereth the face of the earth : come now , curse i they ; peradventure i shall be able to overcome they , and drive they out .
and god say unto balaam , thou shalt not go with they ; thou shalt not curse the people : for they be bless .
and balaam rise up in the morning , and say unto the prince of balak , get you into you land : for the lord refuseth to give i leave to go with you .
and the prince of moab rise up , and they go unto balak , and say , balaam refuseth to come with we .
and balak send yet again prince , more , and more honourable than they .
and they come to balaam , and say to he , thus saith balak the son of zippor , let nothing , i pray thee , hinder thee from come unto i :
for i will promote thee unto very great honour , and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto i : come therefore , i pray thee , curse i this people .
and balaam answer and say unto the servant of balak , if balak would give i he house full of silver and gold , i can not go beyond the word of the lord my god , to do less or more .
now therefore , i pray you , tarry ye also here this night , that i may know what the lord will say unto i more .
and god come unto balaam at night , and say unto he , if the man come to call thee , rise up , and go with they ; but yet the word which i shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
and balaam rise up in the morning , and saddle he ass , and go with the prince of moab .
and god 's anger be kindle because he go : and the angel of the lord stand in the way for a adversary against he .
now he be ride upon he ass , and he two servant be with he .
and the ass see the angel of the lord standing in the way , and he sword draw in he hand : and the ass turn aside out of the way , and go into the field : and balaam smite the ass , to turn she into the way .
but the angel of the lord stand in a path of the vineyard , a wall be on this side , and a wall on that side .
and when the ass see the angel of the lord , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed balaam 's foot against the wall : and he smite she again .
and the angel of the lord go further , and stand in a narrow place , where be no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass see the angel of the lord , she fall down under balaam : and balaam 's anger be kindle , and he smite the ass with a staff .
and the lord open the mouth of the ass , and she say unto balaam , what have i do unto thee , that thou hast smite i these three time ?
and balaam say unto the ass , because thou hast mock i : i would there be a sword in mine hand , for now would i kill thee .
and the ass say unto balaam , be not i thine ass , upon which thou hast ridden ever since i be thine unto this day ? be i ever wont to do so unto thee ?
and he say , nay .
then the lord open the eye of balaam , and he see the angel of the lord standing in the way , and he sword draw in he hand : and he bow down he head , and fall flat on he face .
and the angel of the lord say unto he , wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three time ? behold , i go out to withstand thee , because thy way be perverse before i :
and the ass see i , and turn from i these three time : unless she have turn from i , surely now also i have slay thee , and save she alive .
and balaam say unto the angel of the lord , i have sin ; for i know not that thou stoodest in the way against i : now therefore , if it displease thee , i will get i back again .
and the angel of the lord say unto balaam , go with the man : but only the word that i shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak .
so balaam go with the prince of balak .
and when balak hear that balaam be come , he go out to meet he unto a city of moab , which be in the border of arnon , which be in the utmost coast .
and balak say unto balaam , do i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee ? wherefore camest thou not unto i ? be i not able indeed to promote thee to honour ?
and balaam say unto balak , lo , i be come unto thee : have i now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that god putteth in my mouth , that shall i speak .
and balaam go with balak , and they come unto kirjathhuzoth .
and balak offer ox and sheep , and send to balaam , and to the prince that be with he .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that balak take balaam , and bring he up into the high place of baal , that thence he might see the utmost part of the people .
and balaam say unto balak , build i here seven altar , and prepare i here seven ox and seven ram .
and balak do as balaam have speak ; and balak and balaam offer on every altar a bullock and a ram .
and balaam say unto balak , stand by thy burnt offering , and i will go : peradventure the lord will come to meet i : and whatsoever he sheweth i i will tell thee .
and he go to a high place .
and god meet balaam : and he say unto he , i have prepare seven altar , and i have offer upon every altar a bullock and a ram .
and the lord put a word in balaam 's mouth , and say , return unto balak , and thus thou shalt speak .
and he return unto he , and , lo , he stand by he burnt sacrifice , he , and all the prince of moab .
and he take up he parable , and say , balak the king of moab have bring i from aram , out of the mountain of the east , say , come , curse i jacob , and come , defy israel .
how shall i curse , whom god have not curse ? or how shall i defy , whom the lord have not defy ?
for from the top of the rock i see he , and from the hill i behold he : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckon among the nation .
who can count the dust of jacob , and the number of the fourth part of israel ?
let i die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like he !
and balak say unto balaam , what hast thou do unto i ?
i take thee to curse mine enemy , and , behold , thou hast bless they altogether .
and he answer and say , must i not take heed to speak that which the lord have put in my mouth ?
and balak say unto he , come , i pray thee , with i unto another place , from whence thou mayest see they : thou shalt see but the utmost part of they , and shalt not see they all : and curse i they from thence .
and he bring he into the field of zophim , to the top of pisgah , and build seven altar , and offer a bullock and a ram on every altar .
and he say unto balak , stand here by thy burnt offering , while i meet the lord yonder .
and the lord meet balaam , and put a word in he mouth , and say , go again unto balak , and say thus .
and when he come to he , behold , he stand by he burnt offering , and the prince of moab with he .
and balak say unto he , what have the lord speak ?
and he take up he parable , and say , rise up , balak , and hear ; hearken unto i , thou son of zippor :
god be not a man , that he should lie ; neither the son of man , that he should repent : have he say , and shall he not do it ? or have he speak , and shall he not make it good ?
behold , i have receive commandment to bless : and he have bless ; and i can not reverse it .
he have not beheld iniquity in jacob , neither have he see perverseness in israel : the lord he god be with he , and the shout of a king be among they .
god bring they out of egypt ; he have as it be the strength of a unicorn .
surely there be no enchantment against jacob , neither be there any divination against israel : accord to this time it shall be say of jacob and of israel , what have god work !
behold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drink the blood of the slay .
and balak say unto balaam , neither curse they at all , nor bless they at all .
but balaam answer and say unto balak , tell not i thee , say , all that the lord speaketh , that i must do ?
and balak say unto balaam , come , i pray thee , i will bring thee unto another place ; peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse i they from thence .
and balak bring balaam unto the top of peor , that looketh toward jeshimon .
and balaam say unto balak , build i here seven altar , and prepare i here seven bullock and seven ram .
and balak do as balaam have say , and offer a bullock and a ram on every altar .
and when balaam see that it please the lord to bless israel , he go not , as at other time , to seek for enchantment , but he set he face toward the wilderness .
and balaam lift up he eye , and he see israel abide in he tent accord to they tribe ; and the spirit of god come upon he .
and he take up he parable , and say , balaam the son of beor have say , and the man whose eye be open have say :
he have say , which hear the word of god , which see the vision of the almighty , fall into a trance , but have he eye open :
how goodly be thy tent , o jacob , and thy tabernacle , o israel !
as the valley be they spread forth , as garden by the river 's side , as the tree of lign aloe which the lord have plant , and as cedar tree beside the water .
he shall pour the water out of he bucket , and he seed shall be in many water , and he king shall be higher than agag , and he kingdom shall be exalt .
god bring he forth out of egypt ; he have as it be the strength of a unicorn : he shall eat up the nation he enemy , and shall break they bone , and pierce they through with he arrow .
he couch , he lay down as a lion , and as a great lion : who shall stir he up ?
bless be he that blesseth thee , and curse be he that curseth thee .
and balak 's anger be kindle against balaam , and he smite he hand together : and balak say unto balaam , i call thee to curse mine enemy , and , behold , thou hast altogether bless they these three time .
therefore now flee thou to thy place : i think to promote thee unto great honour ; but , lo , the lord have keep thee back from honour .
and balaam say unto balak , spake i not also to thy messenger which thou sentest unto i , say ,
if balak would give i he house full of silver and gold , i can not go beyond the commandment of the lord , to do either good or bad of mine own mind ; but what the lord saith , that will i speak ?
and now , behold , i go unto my people : come therefore , and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter day .
and he take up he parable , and say , balaam the son of beor have say , and the man whose eye be open have say :
he have say , which hear the word of god , and know the knowledge of the most high , which see the vision of the almighty , fall into a trance , but have he eye open :
i shall see he , but not now : i shall behold he , but not nigh : there shall come a star out of jacob , and a sceptre shall rise out of israel , and shall smite the corner of moab , and destroy all the child of sheth .
and edom shall be a possession , seir also shall be a possession for he enemy ; and israel shall do valiantly .
out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion , and shall destroy he that remaineth of the city .
and when he look on amalek , he take up he parable , and say , amalek be the first of the nation ; but he latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
and he look on the kenites , and take up he parable , and say , strong be thy dwellingplace , and thou puttest thy nest in a rock .
nevertheless the kenite shall be waste , until asshur shall carry thee away captive .
and he take up he parable , and say , alas , who shall live when god doeth this !
and ship shall come from the coast of chittim , and shall afflict asshur , and shall afflict eber , and he also shall perish for ever .
and balaam rise up , and go and return to he place : and balak also go he way .
and israel abode in shittim , and the people begin to commit whoredom with the daughter of moab .
and they call the people unto the sacrifice of they god : and the people do eat , and bow down to they god .
and israel join himself unto baalpeor : and the anger of the lord be kindle against israel .
and the lord say unto mose , take all the head of the people , and hang they up before the lord against the sun , that the fierce anger of the lord may be turn away from israel .

if a man vow a vow unto the lord , or swear a oath to bind he soul with a bond ; he shall not break he word , he shall do accord to all that proceedeth out of he mouth .
if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord , and bind herself by a bond , be in she father 's house in she youth ;
and she father hear she vow , and she bond wherewith she have bind she soul , and she father shall hold he peace at she : then all she vow shall stand , and every bond wherewith she have bind she soul shall stand .
but if she father disallow she in the day that he heareth ; not any of she vow , or of she bond wherewith she have bind she soul , shall stand : and the lord shall forgive she , because she father disallow she .
and if she have at all a husband , when she vow , or utter ought out of she lip , wherewith she bind she soul ;
and she husband hear it , and hold he peace at she in the day that he hear it : then she vow shall stand , and she bond wherewith she bind she soul shall stand .
but if she husband disallow she on the day that he hear it ; then he shall make she vow which she vow , and that which she utter with she lip , wherewith she bind she soul , of none effect : and the lord shall forgive she .
but every vow of a widow , and of she that be divorce , wherewith they have bind they soul , shall stand against she .
and if she vow in she husband 's house , or bind she soul by a bond with a oath ;
and she husband hear it , and hold he peace at she , and disallow she not : then all she vow shall stand , and every bond wherewith she bind she soul shall stand .
but if she husband have utterly make they void on the day he hear they ; then whatsoever proceed out of she lip concern she vow , or concern the bond of she soul , shall not stand : she husband have make they void ; and the lord shall forgive she .
every vow , and every binding oath to afflict the soul , she husband may establish it , or she husband may make it void .
but if she husband altogether hold he peace at she from day to day ; then he establisheth all she vow , or all she bond , which be upon she : he confirmeth they , because he hold he peace at she in the day that he hear they .
but if he shall any way make they void after that he have hear they ; then he shall bear she iniquity .
these be the statute , which the lord command moses , between a man and he wife , between the father and he daughter , be yet in she youth in she father 's house .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
avenge the child of israel of the midianites : afterward shalt thou be gather unto thy people .
and moses spake unto the people , say , arm some of yourselve unto the war , and let they go against the midianites , and avenge the lord of midian .

and they burn all they city wherein they dwell , and all they goodly castle , with fire .
and they take all the spoil , and all the prey , both of man and of beast .
and they bring the captive , and the prey , and the spoil , unto mose , and eleazar the priest , and unto the congregation of the child of israel , unto the camp at the plain of moab , which be by jordan near jericho .
and moses , and eleazar the priest , and all the prince of the congregation , go forth to meet they without the camp .
and moses be wroth with the officer of the host , with the captain over thousand , and captain over hundred , which come from the battle .
and moses say unto they , have ye save all the woman alive ?
behold , these cause the child of israel , through the counsel of balaam , to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor , and there be a plague among the congregation of the lord .
now therefore kill every male among the little one , and kill every woman that have known man by lie with he .
but all the woman child , that have not know a man by lie with he , keep alive for yourselve .
and do ye abide without the camp seven day : whosoever have kill any person , and whosoever have touch any slay , purify both yourselve and you captive on the third day , and on the seventh day .
and purify all you raiment , and all that be make of skin , and all work of goat ' hair , and all thing make of wood .

every thing that may abide the fire , ye shall make it go through the fire , and it shall be clean : nevertheless it shall be purify with the water of separation : and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water .
and ye shall wash you clothes on the seventh day , and ye shall be clean , and afterward ye shall come into the camp .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
take the sum of the prey that be take , both of man and of beast , thou , and eleazar the priest , and the chief father of the congregation :
and divide the prey into two part ; between they that take the war upon they , who go out to battle , and between all the congregation :
and levy a tribute unto the lord of the man of war which go out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the person , and of the beef , and of the ass , and of the sheep :
take it of they half , and give it unto eleazar the priest , for a heave offering of the lord .
and of the child of israel 's half , thou shalt take one portion of fifty , of the person , of the beef , of the ass , and of the flock , of all manner of beast , and give they unto the levites , which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord .
and moses and eleazar the priest do as the lord command moses .

and the person be sixteen thousand ; of which the lord 's tribute be thirty and two person .
and moses give the tribute , which be the lord 's heave offering , unto eleazar the priest , as the lord command moses .
and of the child of israel 's half , which mose divide from the man that war ,
( now the half that pertain unto the congregation be three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep ,
and thirty and six thousand beef ,
and thirty thousand ass and five hundred ,
and sixteen thousand person ; )
even of the child of israel 's half , moses take one portion of fifty , both of man and of beast , and give they unto the levites , which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord ; as the lord command moses .
and the officer which be over thousand of the host , the captain of thousand , and captain of hundred , come near unto mose :
and they say unto mose , thy servant have take the sum of the man of war which be under we charge , and there lacketh not one man of we .
we have therefore bring a oblation for the lord , what every man have get , of jewel of gold , chain , and bracelet , ring , earring , and tablet , to make a atonement for we soul before the lord .
and moses and eleazar the priest take the gold of they , even all work jewel .
and all the gold of the offering that they offer up to the lord , of the captain of thousand , and of the captain of hundred , be sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekel .
( for the man of war have take spoil , every man for himself . )
and moses and eleazar the priest take the gold of the captain of thousand and of hundred , and bring it into the tabernacle of the congregation , for a memorial for the child of israel before the lord .
now the child of reuben and the child of gad have a very great multitude of cattle : and when they see the land of jazer , and the land of gilead , that , behold , the place be a place for cattle ;
the child of gad and the child of reuben come and speak unto mose , and to eleazar the priest , and unto the prince of the congregation , say ,

even the country which the lord smite before the congregation of israel , be a land for cattle , and thy servant have cattle :
wherefore , say they , if we have find grace in thy sight , let this land be give unto thy servant for a possession , and bring we not over jordan .
and moses say unto the child of gad and to the child of reuben , shall you brethren go to war , and shall ye sit here ?
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the child of israel from go over into the land which the lord have give they ?
thus do you father , when i send they from kadeshbarnea to see the land .
for when they go up unto the valley of eshcol , and see the land , they discourage the heart of the child of israel , that they should not go into the land which the lord have give they .
and the lord 's anger be kindle the same time , and he sware , say ,
surely none of the man that come up out of egypt , from twenty year old and upward , shall see the land which i sware unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob ; because they have not wholly follow i :
save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite , and joshua the son of nun : for they have wholly follow the lord .
and the lord 's anger be kindle against israel , and he make they wander in the wilderness forty year , until all the generation , that have do evil in the sight of the lord , be consume .
and , behold , ye be rise up in you father ' stead , a increase of sinful man , to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel .
for if ye turn away from after he , he will yet again leave they in the wilderness ; and ye shall destroy all this people .
and they come near unto he , and say , we will build sheepfold here for we cattle , and city for we little one :
but we ourselves will go ready arm before the child of israel , until we have bring they unto they place : and we little one shall dwell in the fenced city because of the inhabitant of the land .
we will not return unto we house , until the child of israel have inherit every man he inheritance .
for we will not inherit with they on yonder side jordan , or forward ; because we inheritance be fall to we on this side jordan eastward .
and moses say unto they , if ye will do this thing , if ye will go armed before the lord to war ,
and will go all of you arm over jordan before the lord , until he have drive out he enemy from before he ,
and the land be subdue before the lord : then afterward ye shall return , and be guiltless before the lord , and before israel ; and this land shall be you possession before the lord .
but if ye will not do so , behold , ye have sin against the lord : and be sure you sin will find you out .
build you city for you little one , and fold for you sheep ; and do that which have proceed out of you mouth .
and the child of gad and the child of reuben spake unto moses , say , thy servant will do as my lord commandeth .
we little one , we wife , we flock , and all we cattle , shall be there in the city of gilead :
but thy servant will pass over , every man arm for war , before the lord to battle , as my lord saith .
so concern they moses command eleazar the priest , and joshua the son of nun , and the chief father of the tribe of the child of israel :
and moses say unto they , if the child of gad and the child of reuben will pass with you over jordan , every man arm to battle , before the lord , and the land shall be subdue before you ; then ye shall give they the land of gilead for a possession :
but if they will not pass over with you armed , they shall have possession among you in the land of canaan .
and the child of gad and the child of reuben answer , say , as the lord have say unto thy servant , so will we do .
we will pass over arm before the lord into the land of canaan , that the possession of we inheritance on this side jordan may be ours .
and moses give unto they , even to the child of gad , and to the child of reuben , and unto half the tribe of manasseh the son of joseph , the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites , and the kingdom of og king of bashan , the land , with the city thereof in the coast , even the city of the country round about .

and bethnimrah , and bethharan , fenced city : and fold for sheep .
and the child of reuben build heshbon , and elealeh , and kirjathaim ,
and nebo , and baalmeon , ( they name be change , ) and shibmah : and give other name unto the city which they build .
and the child of machir the son of manasseh go to gilead , and take it , and dispossess the amorite which be in it .
and moses give gilead unto machir the son of manasseh ; and he dwell therein .
and jair the son of manasseh go and take the small town thereof , and call they havothjair .
and nobah go and take kenath , and the village thereof , and call it nobah , after he own name .
these be the journey of the child of israel , which go forth out of the land of egypt with they army under the hand of moses and aaron .
and moses write they going out accord to they journey by the commandment of the lord : and these be they journey accord to they going out .
and they depart from rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the morrow after the passover the child of israel go out with a high hand in the sight of all the egyptians .
for the egyptians bury all they firstborn , which the lord have smite among they : upon they god also the lord execute judgment .
and the child of israel remove from rameses , and pitch in succoth .
and they depart from succoth , and pitch in etham , which be in the edge of the wilderness .

and they remove from eziongaber , and pitch in the wilderness of zin , which be kadesh .
and they remove from kadesh , and pitch in mount hor , in the edge of the land of edom .
and aaron the priest go up into mount hor at the commandment of the lord , and die there , in the fortieth year after the child of israel be come out of the land of egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
and aaron be a hundred and twenty and three year old when he die in mount hor .
and king arad the canaanite , which dwell in the south in the land of canaan , hear of the come of the child of israel .
and they depart from mount hor , and pitch in zalmonah .
and they depart from zalmonah , and pitch in punon .

and they remove from almondiblathaim , and pitch in the mountain of abarim , before nebo .
and they depart from the mountain of abarim , and pitch in the plain of moab by jordan near jericho .
and they pitch by jordan , from bethjesimoth even unto abelshittim in the plain of moab .
and the lord speak unto mose in the plain of moab by jordan near jericho , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye be pass over jordan into the land of canaan ;
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitant of the land from before you , and destroy all they picture , and destroy all they molten image , and quite pluck down all they high place :
and ye shall dispossess the inhabitant of the land , and dwell therein : for i have give you the land to possess it .
and ye shall divide the land by lot for a inheritance among you family : and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance , and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance : every man 's inheritance shall be in the place where he lot falleth ; accord to the tribe of you father ye shall inherit .
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitant of the land from before you ; then it shall come to pass , that those which ye let remain of they shall be prick in you eye , and thorn in you side , and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell .
moreover it shall come to pass , that i shall do unto you , as i think to do unto they .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
command the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye come into the land of canaan ; ( this be the land that shall fall unto you for a inheritance , even the land of canaan with the coast thereof : )
then you south quarter shall be from the wilderness of zin along by the coast of edom , and you south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward :
and you border shall turn from the south to the ascent of akrabbim , and pass on to zin : and the go forth thereof shall be from the south to kadeshbarnea , and shall go on to hazaraddar , and pass on to azmon :
and the border shall fetch a compass from azmon unto the river of egypt , and the going out of it shall be at the sea .
and as for the western border , ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be you west border .
and this shall be you north border : from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount hor :
from mount hor ye shall point out you border unto the entrance of hamath ; and the going forth of the border shall be to zedad :
and the border shall go on to ziphron , and the going out of it shall be at hazarenan : this shall be you north border .
and ye shall point out you east border from hazarenan to shepham :
and the coast shall go down from shepham to riblah , on the east side of ain ; and the border shall descend , and shall reach unto the side of the sea of chinnereth eastward :
and the border shall go down to jordan , and the going out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be you land with the coast thereof round about .
and moses command the child of israel , say , this be the land which ye shall inherit by lot , which the lord command to give unto the nine tribe , and to the half tribe :
for the tribe of the child of reuben accord to the house of they father , and the tribe of the child of gad accord to the house of they father , have receive they inheritance ; and half the tribe of manasseh have receive they inheritance :
the two tribe and the half tribe have receive they inheritance on this side jordan near jericho eastward , toward the sunrising .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
these be the name of the man which shall divide the land unto you : eleazar the priest , and joshua the son of nun .
and ye shall take one prince of every tribe , to divide the land by inheritance .
and the name of the man be these : of the tribe of judah , caleb the son of jephunneh .
and of the tribe of the child of simeon , shemuel the son of ammihud .
of the tribe of benjamin , elidad the son of chislon .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of dan , bukki the son of jogli .
the prince of the child of joseph , for the tribe of the child of manasseh , hanniel the son of ephod .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of ephraim , kemuel the son of shiphtan .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of zebulun , elizaphan the son of parnach .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of issachar , paltiel the son of azzan .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of asher , ahihud the son of shelomi .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of naphtali , pedahel the son of ammihud .
these be they whom the lord command to divide the inheritance unto the child of israel in the land of canaan .
and the lord speak unto mose in the plain of moab by jordan near jericho , say ,
command the child of israel , that they give unto the levites of the inheritance of they possession city to dwell in ; and ye shall give also unto the levites suburb for the city round about they .
and the city shall they have to dwell in ; and the suburb of they shall be for they cattle , and for they goods , and for all they beast .
and the suburb of the city , which ye shall give unto the levites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubit round about .
and ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubit , and on the south side two thousand cubit , and on the west side two thousand cubit , and on the north side two thousand cubit ; and the city shall be in the midst : this shall be to they the suburb of the city .
and among the city which ye shall give unto the levites there shall be six city for refuge , which ye shall appoint for the manslayer , that he may flee thither : and to they ye shall add forty and two city .
so all the city which ye shall give to the levites shall be forty and eight city : they shall ye give with they suburb .
and the city which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the child of israel : from they that have many ye shall give many ; but from they that have few ye shall give few : every one shall give of he city unto the levites accord to he inheritance which he inheriteth .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye be come over jordan into the land of canaan ;
then ye shall appoint you city to be city of refuge for you ; that the slayer may flee thither , which killeth any person at unaware .
and they shall be unto you city for refuge from the avenger ; that the manslayer die not , until he stand before the congregation in judgment .
and of these city which ye shall give six city shall ye have for refuge .
ye shall give three city on this side jordan , and three city shall ye give in the land of canaan , which shall be city of refuge .
these six city shall be a refuge , both for the child of israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among they : that every one that killeth any person unaware may flee thither .
and if he smite he with a instrument of iron , so that he die , he be a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
and if he smite he with throw a stone , wherewith he may die , and he die , he be a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he smite he with a hand weapon of wood , wherewith he may die , and he die , he be a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer : when he meeteth he , he shall slay he .
but if he thrust he of hatred , or hurl at he by lay of wait , that he die ;
or in enmity smite he with he hand , that he die : he that smite he shall surely be put to death ; for he be a murderer : the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer , when he meeteth he .
but if he thrust he suddenly without enmity , or have cast upon he any thing without lay of wait ,
or with any stone , wherewith a man may die , see he not , and cast it upon he , that he die , and be not he enemy , neither seek he harm :
then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood accord to these judgment :
and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood , and the congregation shall restore he to the city of he refuge , whither he be flee : and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest , which be anoint with the holy oil .
but if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of he refuge , whither he be flee ;
and the revenger of blood find he without the border of the city of he refuge , and the revenger of blood kill the slayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood :
because he should have remain in the city of he refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of he possession .
so these thing shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout you generation in all you dwelling .
whoso killeth any person , the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witness : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause he to die .
moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer , which be guilty of death : but he shall be surely put to death .
and ye shall take no satisfaction for he that be flee to the city of he refuge , that he should come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye be : for blood it defileth the land : and the land can not be cleanse of the blood that be shed therein , but by the blood of he that shed it .
defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit , wherein i dwell : for i the lord dwell among the child of israel .
and the chief father of the family of the child of gilead , the son of machir , the son of manasseh , of the family of the son of joseph , come near , and spake before moses , and before the prince , the chief father of the child of israel :
and they say , the lord command my lord to give the land for a inheritance by lot to the child of israel : and my lord be command by the lord to give the inheritance of zelophehad we brother unto he daughter .
and if they be marry to any of the son of the other tribe of the child of israel , then shall they inheritance be take from the inheritance of we father , and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they be receive : so shall it be take from the lot of we inheritance .
and when the jubile of the child of israel shall be , then shall they inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they be receive : so shall they inheritance be take away from the inheritance of the tribe of we father .
and moses command the child of israel accord to the word of the lord , say , the tribe of the son of joseph have say well .
this be the thing which the lord doth command concern the daughter of zelophehad , say , let they marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of they father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the child of israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the child of israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of he father .
and every daughter , that possesseth a inheritance in any tribe of the child of israel , shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of she father , that the child of israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of he father .
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; but every one of the tribe of the child of israel shall keep himself to he own inheritance .
even as the lord command moses , so do the daughter of zelophehad :
for mahlah , tirzah , and hoglah , and milcah , and noah , the daughter of zelophehad , be marry unto they father 's brother ' son :
and they be marry into the family of the son of manasseh the son of joseph , and they inheritance remain in the tribe of the family of they father .
these be the commandment and the judgment , which the lord command by the hand of moses unto the child of israel in the plain of moab by jordan near jericho .
these be the word which moses spake unto all israel on this side jordan in the wilderness , in the plain over against the red sea , between paran , and tophel , and laban , and hazeroth , and dizahab .
( there be eleven day ' journey from horeb by the way of mount seir unto kadeshbarnea . )
and it come to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that moses spake unto the child of israel , accord unto all that the lord have give he in commandment unto they ;
after he have slay sihon the king of the amorites , which dwell in heshbon , and og the king of bashan , which dwell at astaroth in edrei :
on this side jordan , in the land of moab , begin moses to declare this law , say ,
the lord we god spake unto we in horeb , say , ye have dwell long enough in this mount :
turn you , and take you journey , and go to the mount of the amorites , and unto all the place nigh thereunto , in the plain , in the hill , and in the vale , and in the south , and by the sea side , to the land of the canaanites , and unto lebanon , unto the great river , the river euphrates .
behold , i have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto you father , abraham , isaac , and jacob , to give unto they and to they seed after they .
and i speak unto you at that time , say , i be not able to bear you myself alone :
the lord you god have multiply you , and , behold , ye be this day as the star of heaven for multitude .
( the lord god of you father make you a thousand time so many more as ye be , and bless you , as he have promise you ! )
how can i myself alone bear you cumbrance , and you burden , and you strife ?
take you wise man , and understanding , and know among you tribe , and i will make they ruler over you .
and ye answer i , and say , the thing which thou hast speak be good for we to do .
so i take the chief of you tribe , wise man , and know , and make they head over you , captain over thousand , and captain over hundred , and captain over fifty , and captain over ten , and officer among you tribe .
and i charge you judge at that time , say , hear the cause between you brethren , and judge righteously between every man and he brother , and the stranger that be with he .
ye shall not respect person in judgment ; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man ; for the judgment be god 's : and the cause that be too hard for you , bring it unto i , and i will hear it .
and i command you at that time all the thing which ye should do .
and when we depart from horeb , we go through all that great and terrible wilderness , which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the amorites , as the lord we god command we ; and we come to kadeshbarnea .
and i say unto you , ye be come unto the mountain of the amorites , which the lord we god doth give unto we .
behold , the lord thy god have set the land before thee : go up and possess it , as the lord god of thy father have say unto thee ; fear not , neither be discourage .
and ye come near unto i every one of you , and say , we will send man before we , and they shall search we out the land , and bring we word again by what way we must go up , and into what city we shall come .
and the say pleased i well : and i take twelve man of you , one of a tribe :
and they turn and go up into the mountain , and come unto the valley of eshcol , and search it out .
and they take of the fruit of the land in they hand , and bring it down unto we , and bring we word again , and say , it be a good land which the lord we god doth give we .
notwithstanding ye would not go up , but rebel against the commandment of the lord you god :
and ye murmur in you tent , and say , because the lord hate we , he have bring we forth out of the land of egypt , to deliver we into the hand of the amorites , to destroy we .
whither shall we go up ? we brethren have discourage we heart , say , the people be greater and taller than we ; the city be great and wall up to heaven ; and moreover we have see the son of the anakims there .
then i say unto you , dread not , neither be afraid of they .
the lord you god which goeth before you , he shall fight for you , accord to all that he do for you in egypt before you eye ;
and in the wilderness , where thou hast see how that the lord thy god bare thee , as a man doth bear he son , in all the way that ye go , until ye come into this place .
yet in this thing ye do not believe the lord you god ,
who go in the way before you , to search you out a place to pitch you tent in , in fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should go , and in a cloud by day .
and the lord hear the voice of you word , and be wroth , and sware , say ,
surely there shall not one of these man of this evil generation see that good land , which i sware to give unto you father ,
save caleb the son of jephunneh ; he shall see it , and to he will i give the land that he have trodden upon , and to he child , because he have wholly follow the lord .
also the lord be angry with i for you sake , say , thou also shalt not go in thither .
but joshua the son of nun , which standeth before thee , he shall go in thither : encourage he : for he shall cause israel to inherit it .
moreover you little one , which ye say should be a prey , and you child , which in that day have no knowledge between good and evil , they shall go in thither , and unto they will i give it , and they shall possess it .
but as for you , turn you , and take you journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea .
then ye answer and say unto i , we have sin against the lord , we will go up and fight , accord to all that the lord we god command we .
and when ye have gird on every man he weapon of war , ye be ready to go up into the hill .
and the lord say unto i , say unto they , go not up , neither fight ; for i be not among you ; lest ye be smite before you enemy .
so i speak unto you ; and ye would not hear , but rebel against the commandment of the lord , and go presumptuously up into the hill .
and the amorites , which dwell in that mountain , come out against you , and chase you , as bee do , and destroy you in seir , even unto hormah .
and ye return and weep before the lord ; but the lord would not hearken to you voice , nor give ear unto you .
so ye abode in kadesh many day , accord unto the day that ye abode there .
then we turn , and take we journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea , as the lord speak unto i : and we compass mount seir many day .
and the lord speak unto i , say ,
ye have compass this mountain long enough : turn you northward .
and command thou the people , say , ye be to pass through the coast of you brethren the child of esau , which dwell in seir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed unto yourselve therefore :
meddle not with they ; for i will not give you of they land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because i have give mount seir unto esau for a possession .
ye shall buy meat of they for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of they for money , that ye may drink .
for the lord thy god have bless thee in all the work of thy hand : he knoweth thy walk through this great wilderness : these forty year the lord thy god have be with thee ; thou hast lack nothing .
and when we pass by from we brethren the child of esau , which dwell in seir , through the way of the plain from elath , and from eziongaber , we turn and pass by the way of the wilderness of moab .
and the lord say unto i , distress not the moabites , neither contend with they in battle : for i will not give thee of they land for a possession ; because i have give ar unto the child of lot for a possession .
the emims dwelt therein in time past , a people great , and many , and tall , as the anakims ;
which also be account giant , as the anakims ; but the moabites call they emims .
the horim also dwell in seir beforetime ; but the child of esau succeed they , when they have destroy they from before they , and dwelt in they stead ; as israel do unto the land of he possession , which the lord give unto they .
now rise up , say i , and get you over the brook zered .
and we go over the brook zered .
and the space in which we come from kadeshbarnea , until we be come over the brook zered , be thirty and eight year ; until all the generation of the man of war be waste out from among the host , as the lord sware unto they .
for indeed the hand of the lord be against they , to destroy they from among the host , until they be consume .
so it come to pass , when all the man of war be consume and dead from among the people ,
that the lord speak unto i , say ,
thou art to pass over through ar , the coast of moab , this day :
and when thou comest nigh over against the child of ammon , distress they not , nor meddle with they : for i will not give thee of the land of the child of ammon any possession ; because i have give it unto the child of lot for a possession .
( that also be account a land of giant : giant dwell therein in old time ; and the ammonites call they zamzummims ;
a people great , and many , and tall , as the anakims ; but the lord destroy they before they ; and they succeed they , and dwelt in they stead :
as he do to the child of esau , which dwell in seir , when he destroy the horims from before they ; and they succeed they , and dwelt in they stead even unto this day :
and the avim which dwell in hazerim , even unto azzah , the caphtorims , which come forth out of caphtor , destroy they , and dwelt in they stead . )
rise ye up , take you journey , and pass over the river arnon : behold , i have give into thine hand sihon the amorite , king of heshbon , and he land : begin to possess it , and contend with he in battle .
this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nation that be under the whole heaven , who shall hear report of thee , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of thee .
and i send messenger out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with word of peace , say ,
let i pass through thy land : i will go along by the high way , i will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left .
thou shalt sell i meat for money , that i may eat ; and give i water for money , that i may drink : only i will pass through on my foot ;
( as the child of esau which dwell in seir , and the moabite which dwell in ar , do unto i ; ) until i shall pass over jordan into the land which the lord we god giveth we .
but sihon king of heshbon would not let we pass by he : for the lord thy god harden he spirit , and make he heart obstinate , that he might deliver he into thy hand , as appeareth this day .
and the lord say unto i , behold , i have begin to give sihon and he land before thee : begin to possess , that thou mayest inherit he land .
then sihon come out against we , he and all he people , to fight at jahaz .
and the lord we god deliver he before we ; and we smite he , and he son , and all he people .
and we take all he city at that time , and utterly destroy the man , and the woman , and the little one , of every city , we leave none to remain :
only the cattle we take for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the city which we take .
from aroer , which be by the brink of the river of arnon , and from the city that be by the river , even unto gilead , there be not one city too strong for we : the lord we god deliver all unto we :
only unto the land of the child of ammon thou camest not , nor unto any place of the river jabbok , nor unto the city in the mountain , nor unto whatsoever the lord we god forbid we .
then we turn , and go up the way to bashan : and og the king of bashan come out against we , he and all he people , to battle at edrei .
and the lord say unto i , fear he not : for i will deliver he , and all he people , and he land , into thy hand ; and thou shalt do unto he as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites , which dwell at heshbon .
so the lord we god deliver into we hand og also , the king of bashan , and all he people : and we smite he until none be leave to he remain .
and we take all he city at that time , there be not a city which we take not from they , threescore city , all the region of argob , the kingdom of og in bashan .
all these city be fence with high wall , gate , and bar ; beside unwalled town a great many .
and we utterly destroy they , as we do unto sihon king of heshbon , utterly destroy the man , woman , and child , of every city .
but all the cattle , and the spoil of the city , we take for a prey to ourselves .
and we take at that time out of the hand of the two king of the amorites the land that be on this side jordan , from the river of arnon unto mount hermon ;
( which hermon the sidonians call sirion ; and the amorites call it shenir ; )
all the city of the plain , and all gilead , and all bashan , unto salchah and edrei , city of the kingdom of og in bashan .
for only og king of bashan remain of the remnant of giant ; behold , he bedstead be a bedstead of iron ; be it not in rabbath of the child of ammon ? nine cubit be the length thereof , and four cubit the breadth of it , after the cubit of a man .
and this land , which we possess at that time , from aroer , which be by the river arnon , and half mount gilead , and the city thereof , give i unto the reubenites and to the gadites .
and the rest of gilead , and all bashan , be the kingdom of og , give i unto the half tribe of manasseh ; all the region of argob , with all bashan , which be call the land of giant .
jair the son of manasseh take all the country of argob unto the coast of geshuri and maachathi ; and call they after he own name , bashanhavothjair , unto this day .
and i give gilead unto machir .
and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i give from gilead even unto the river arnon half the valley , and the border even unto the river jabbok , which be the border of the child of ammon ;
the plain also , and jordan , and the coast thereof , from chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , under ashdothpisgah eastward .
and i command you at that time , say , the lord you god have give you this land to possess it : ye shall pass over arm before you brethren the child of israel , all that be meet for the war .
but you wife , and you little one , and you cattle , ( for i know that ye have much cattle , ) shall abide in you city which i have give you ;
until the lord have give rest unto you brethren , as well as unto you , and until they also possess the land which the lord you god have give they beyond jordan : and then shall ye return every man unto he possession , which i have give you .
and i command joshua at that time , say , thine eye have see all that the lord you god have do unto these two king : so shall the lord do unto all the kingdom whither thou passest .
ye shall not fear they : for the lord you god he shall fight for you .
and i beseech the lord at that time , say ,
o lord god , thou hast begin to shew thy servant thy greatness , and thy mighty hand : for what god be there in heaven or in earth , that can do accord to thy work , and accord to thy might ?
i pray thee , let i go over , and see the good land that be beyond jordan , that goodly mountain , and lebanon .
but the lord be wroth with i for you sake , and would not hear i : and the lord say unto i , let it suffice thee ; speak no more unto i of this matter .
get thee up into the top of pisgah , and lift up thine eye westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and behold it with thine eye : for thou shalt not go over this jordan .
but charge joshua , and encourage he , and strengthen he : for he shall go over before this people , and he shall cause they to inherit the land which thou shalt see .
so we abide in the valley over against bethpeor .
now therefore hearken , o israel , unto the statute and unto the judgment , which i teach you , for to do they , that ye may live , and go in and possess the land which the lord god of you father giveth you .
ye shall not add unto the word which i command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandment of the lord you god which i command you .
you eye have see what the lord do because of baalpeor : for all the man that follow baalpeor , the lord thy god have destroy they from among you .
but ye that do cleave unto the lord you god be alive every one of you this day .
behold , i have teach you statute and judgment , even as the lord my god command i , that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it .
keep therefore and do they ; for this be you wisdom and you understanding in the sight of the nation , which shall hear all these statute , and say , surely this great nation be a wise and understand people .
for what nation be there so great , who have god so nigh unto they , as the lord we god be in all thing that we call upon he for ?
and what nation be there so great , that have statute and judgment so righteous as all this law , which i set before you this day ?
only take heed to thyself , and keep thy soul diligently , lest thou forget the thing which thine eye have see , and lest they depart from thy heart all the day of thy life : but teach they thy son , and thy son ' son ;
specially the day that thou stoodest before the lord thy god in horeb , when the lord say unto i , gather i the people together , and i will make they hear my word , that they may learn to fear i all the day that they shall live upon the earth , and that they may teach they child .
and ye come near and stand under the mountain ; and the mountain burn with fire unto the midst of heaven , with darkness , cloud , and thick darkness .
and the lord speak unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye hear the voice of the word , but see no similitude ; only ye hear a voice .
and he declare unto you he covenant , which he command you to perform , even ten commandment ; and he write they upon two table of stone .
and the lord command i at that time to teach you statute and judgment , that ye might do they in the land whither ye go over to possess it .
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselve ; for ye see no manner of similitude on the day that the lord speak unto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire :
lest ye corrupt yourselve , and make you a graven image , the similitude of any figure , the likeness of male or female ,
the likeness of any beast that be on the earth , the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air ,
the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground , the likeness of any fish that be in the water beneath the earth :
and lest thou lift up thine eye unto heaven , and when thou seest the sun , and the moon , and the star , even all the host of heaven , shouldest be drive to worship they , and serve they , which the lord thy god have divide unto all nation under the whole heaven .
but the lord have take you , and bring you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of egypt , to be unto he a people of inheritance , as ye be this day .
furthermore the lord be angry with i for you sake , and sware that i should not go over jordan , and that i should not go in unto that good land , which the lord thy god giveth thee for a inheritance :
but i must die in this land , i must not go over jordan : but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
take heed unto yourselve , lest ye forget the covenant of the lord you god , which he make with you , and make you a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , which the lord thy god have forbid thee .
for the lord thy god be a consuming fire , even a jealous god .
when thou shalt beget child , and child 's child , and ye shall have remain long in the land , and shall corrupt yourselve , and make a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , and shall do evil in the sight of the lord thy god , to provoke he to anger :
i call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan to possess it ; ye shall not prolong you day upon it , but shall utterly be destroy .
and the lord shall scatter you among the nation , and ye shall be leave few in number among the heathen , whither the lord shall lead you .
and there ye shall serve god , the work of man 's hand , wood and stone , which neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor smell .
but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god , thou shalt find he , if thou seek he with all thy heart and with all thy soul .
when thou art in tribulation , and all these thing be come upon thee , even in the latter day , if thou turn to the lord thy god , and shalt be obedient unto he voice ;
( for the lord thy god be a merciful god ; ) he will not forsake thee , neither destroy thee , nor forget the covenant of thy father which he sware unto they .
for ask now of the day that be past , which be before thee , since the day that god create man upon the earth , and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other , whether there have be any such thing as this great thing be , or have be hear like it ?
do ever people hear the voice of god speak out of the midst of the fire , as thou hast hear , and live ?
or have god assay to go and take he a nation from the midst of another nation , by temptation , by sign , and by wonder , and by war , and by a mighty hand , and by a stretch out arm , and by great terror , accord to all that the lord you god do for you in egypt before you eye ?
unto thee it be shew , that thou mightest know that the lord he be god ; there be none else beside he .
out of heaven he make thee to hear he voice , that he might instruct thee : and upon earth he shew thee he great fire ; and thou heardest he word out of the midst of the fire .
and because he love thy father , therefore he choose they seed after they , and bring thee out in he sight with he mighty power out of egypt ;
to drive out nation from before thee greater and mightier than thou art , to bring thee in , to give thee they land for a inheritance , as it be this day .
know therefore this day , and consider it in thine heart , that the lord he be god in heaven above , and upon the earth beneath : there be none else .
thou shalt keep therefore he statute , and he commandment , which i command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with thy child after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy day upon the earth , which the lord thy god giveth thee , for ever .
then moses sever three city on this side jordan toward the sunrising ;
that the slayer might flee thither , which should kill he neighbour unaware , and hate he not in time past ; and that flee unto one of these city he might live :
namely , bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , of the reubenites ; and ramoth in gilead , of the gadites ; and golan in bashan , of the manassites .
and this be the law which moses set before the child of israel :
these be the testimony , and the statute , and the judgment , which moses spake unto the child of israel , after they come forth out of egypt ,
on this side jordan , in the valley over against bethpeor , in the land of sihon king of the amorites , who dwell at heshbon , whom mose and the child of israel smite , after they be come forth out of egypt :
and they possess he land , and the land of og king of bashan , two king of the amorites , which be on this side jordan toward the sunrising ;
from aroer , which be by the bank of the river arnon , even unto mount sion , which be hermon ,
and all the plain on this side jordan eastward , even unto the sea of the plain , under the spring of pisgah .
and moses call all israel , and say unto they , hear , o israel , the statute and judgment which i speak in you ear this day , that ye may learn they , and keep , and do they .
the lord we god make a covenant with we in horeb .
the lord make not this covenant with we father , but with we , even we , who be all of we here alive this day .
the lord talk with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire ,
( i stand between the lord and you at that time , to shew you the word of the lord : for ye be afraid by reason of the fire , and go not up into the mount ; ) say ,
i be the lord thy god , which bring thee out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage .
thou shalt have none other god before i .
thou shalt not make thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that be in heaven above , or that be in the earth beneath , or that be in the water beneath the earth :
thou shalt not bow down thyself unto they , nor serve they : for i the lord thy god be a jealous god , visit the iniquity of the father upon the child unto the third and fourth generation of they that hate i ,
and shew mercy unto thousand of they that love i and keep my commandment .
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain : for the lord will not hold he guiltless that taketh he name in vain .
keep the sabbath day to sanctify it , as the lord thy god have command thee .
six day thou shalt labour , and do all thy work :
but the seventh day be the sabbath of the lord thy god : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , nor thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thine ox , nor thine ass , nor any of thy cattle , nor thy stranger that be within thy gate ; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou .
and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt , and that the lord thy god bring thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretch out arm : therefore the lord thy god command thee to keep the sabbath day .
honour thy father and thy mother , as the lord thy god have command thee ; that thy day may be prolong , and that it may go well with thee , in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
thou shalt not kill .
neither shalt thou commit adultery .
neither shalt thou steal .
neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour .
neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour 's wife , neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour 's house , he field , or he manservant , or he maidservant , he ox , or he ass , or any thing that be thy neighbour 's .
these word the lord spake unto all you assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thick darkness , with a great voice : and he add no more .
and he write they in two table of stone , and deliver they unto i .
and it come to pass , when ye hear the voice out of the midst of the darkness , ( for the mountain do burn with fire , ) that ye come near unto i , even all the head of you tribe , and you elder ;
and ye say , behold , the lord we god have shewed we he glory and he greatness , and we have hear he voice out of the midst of the fire : we have see this day that god doth talk with man , and he liveth .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume we : if we hear the voice of the lord we god any more , then we shall die .
for who be there of all flesh , that have hear the voice of the living god speak out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and live ?
go thou near , and hear all that the lord we god shall say : and speak thou unto we all that the lord we god shall speak unto thee ; and we will hear it , and do it .
and the lord hear the voice of you word , when ye spake unto i ; and the lord say unto i , i have hear the voice of the word of this people , which they have speak unto thee : they have well say all that they have speak .
o that there be such a heart in they , that they would fear i , and keep all my commandment always , that it might be well with they , and with they child for ever !
go say to they , get you into you tent again .
but as for thee , stand thou here by i , and i will speak unto thee all the commandment , and the statute , and the judgment , which thou shalt teach they , that they may do they in the land which i give they to possess it .
ye shall observe to do therefore as the lord you god have command you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
ye shall walk in all the way which the lord you god have command you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prolong you day in the land which ye shall possess .
now these be the commandment , the statute , and the judgment , which the lord you god command to teach you , that ye might do they in the land whither ye go to possess it :
that thou mightest fear the lord thy god , to keep all he statute and he commandment , which i command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son 's son , all the day of thy life ; and that thy day may be prolong .
hear therefore , o israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with thee , and that ye may increase mightily , as the lord god of thy father have promise thee , in the land that floweth with milk and honey .
hear , o israel : the lord we god be one lord :
and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might .
and these word , which i command thee this day , shall be in thine heart :
and thou shalt teach they diligently unto thy child , and shalt talk of they when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , and when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
and thou shalt bind they for a sign upon thine hand , and they shall be as frontlet between thine eye .
and thou shalt write they upon the post of thy house , and on thy gate .
and it shall be , when the lord thy god shall have bring thee into the land which he sware unto thy father , to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob , to give thee great and goodly city , which thou buildedst not ,
and house full of all good thing , which thou filledst not , and well dig , which thou diggedst not , vineyard and olive tree , which thou plantedst not ; when thou shalt have eat and be full ;
then beware lest thou forget the lord , which bring thee forth out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage .
thou shalt fear the lord thy god , and serve he , and shalt swear by he name .
ye shall not go after other god , of the god of the people which be round about you ;
( for the lord thy god be a jealous god among you ) lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindle against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
ye shall not tempt the lord you god , as ye tempt he in massah .
ye shall diligently keep the commandment of the lord you god , and he testimony , and he statute , which he have command thee .
and thou shalt do that which be right and good in the sight of the lord : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the lord sware unto thy father ,
to cast out all thine enemy from before thee , as the lord have speak .
and when thy son asketh thee in time to come , say , what mean the testimony , and the statute , and the judgment , which the lord we god have command you ?
then thou shalt say unto thy son , we be pharaoh 's bondman in egypt ; and the lord bring we out of egypt with a mighty hand :
and the lord shew sign and wonder , great and sore , upon egypt , upon pharaoh , and upon all he household , before we eye :
and he bring we out from thence , that he might bring we in , to give we the land which he sware unto we father .
and the lord command we to do all these statute , to fear the lord we god , for we good always , that he might preserve we alive , as it be at this day .
and it shall be we righteousness , if we observe to do all these commandment before the lord we god , as he have command we .
when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it , and have cast out many nation before thee , the hittites , and the girgashites , and the amorites , and the canaanites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , seven nation greater and mightier than thou ;
and when the lord thy god shall deliver they before thee ; thou shalt smite they , and utterly destroy they ; thou shalt make no covenant with they , nor shew mercy unto they :
neither shalt thou make marriage with they ; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto he son , nor he daughter shalt thou take unto thy son .
for they will turn away thy son from follow i , that they may serve other god : so will the anger of the lord be kindle against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
but thus shall ye deal with they ; ye shall destroy they altar , and break down they image , and cut down they grove , and burn they graven image with fire .
for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god : the lord thy god have choose thee to be a special people unto himself , above all people that be upon the face of the earth .
the lord do not set he love upon you , nor choose you , because ye be more in number than any people ; for ye be the fewest of all people :
but because the lord love you , and because he would keep the oath which he have swear unto you father , have the lord bring you out with a mighty hand , and redeem you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt .
know therefore that the lord thy god , he be god , the faithful god , which keepeth covenant and mercy with they that love he and keep he commandment to a thousand generation ;
and repayeth they that hate he to they face , to destroy they : he will not be slack to he that hateth he , he will repay he to he face .
thou shalt therefore keep the commandment , and the statute , and the judgment , which i command thee this day , to do they .
wherefore it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these judgment , and keep , and do they , that the lord thy god shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy father :
and he will love thee , and bless thee , and multiply thee : he will also bless the fruit of thy womb , and the fruit of thy land , thy corn , and thy wine , and thine oil , the increase of thy kine , and the flock of thy sheep , in the land which he sware unto thy father to give thee .
thou shalt be bless above all people : there shall not be male or female barren among you , or among you cattle .
and the lord will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil disease of egypt , which thou knowest , upon thee ; but will lay they upon all they that hate thee .
and thou shalt consume all the people which the lord thy god shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon they : neither shalt thou serve they god ; for that will be a snare unto thee .
if thou shalt say in thine heart , these nation be more than i ; how can i dispossess they ?
thou shalt not be afraid of they : but shalt well remember what the lord thy god do unto pharaoh , and unto all egypt ;
the great temptation which thine eye see , and the sign , and the wonder , and the mighty hand , and the stretch out arm , whereby the lord thy god bring thee out : so shall the lord thy god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid .
moreover the lord thy god will send the hornet among they , until they that be leave , and hide themselves from thee , be destroy .
thou shalt not be affright at they : for the lord thy god be among you , a mighty god and terrible .
and the lord thy god will put out those nation before thee by little and little : thou mayest not consume they at once , lest the beast of the field increase upon thee .
but the lord thy god shall deliver they unto thee , and shall destroy they with a mighty destruction , until they be destroy .
and he shall deliver they king into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy they name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroy they .
the graven image of they god shall ye burn with fire : thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that be on they , nor take it unto thee , lest thou be snare therein : for it be a abomination to the lord thy god .
neither shalt thou bring a abomination into thine house , lest thou be a cursed thing like it : but thou shalt utterly detest it , and thou shalt utterly abhor it ; for it be a cursed thing .
all the commandment which i command thee this day shall ye observe to do , that ye may live , and multiply , and go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto you father .
and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god lead thee these forty year in the wilderness , to humble thee , and to prove thee , to know what be in thine heart , whether thou wouldest keep he commandment , or no. .
and he humble thee , and suffer thee to hunger , and feed thee with manna , which thou knewest not , neither do thy father know ; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live .
thy raiment wax not old upon thee , neither do thy foot swell , these forty year .
thou shalt also consider in thine heart , that , as a man chasteneth he son , so the lord thy god chasteneth thee .
therefore thou shalt keep the commandment of the lord thy god , to walk in he way , and to fear he .
for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good land , a land of brook of water , of fountain and depths that spring out of valley and hill ;
a land of wheat , and barley , and vine , and fig tree , and pomegranate ; a land of oil olive , and honey ;
a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness , thou shalt not lack any thing in it ; a land whose stone be iron , and out of whose hill thou mayest dig brass .
when thou hast eat and art full , then thou shalt bless the lord thy god for the good land which he have give thee .
beware that thou forget not the lord thy god , in not keep he commandment , and he judgment , and he statute , which i command thee this day :
lest when thou hast eat and art full , and hast build goodly house , and dwelt therein ;
and when thy herd and thy flock multiply , and thy silver and thy gold be multiply , and all that thou hast be multiply ;
then thine heart be lift up , and thou forget the lord thy god , which bring thee forth out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage ;
who lead thee through that great and terrible wilderness , wherein be fiery serpent , and scorpion , and drought , where there be no water ; who bring thee forth water out of the rock of flint ;
who feed thee in the wilderness with manna , which thy father know not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
and thou say in thine heart , my power and the might of mine hand have get i this wealth .
but thou shalt remember the lord thy god : for it be he that giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish he covenant which he sware unto thy father , as it be this day .
and it shall be , if thou do at all forget the lord thy god , and walk after other god , and serve they , and worship they , i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish .
as the nation which the lord destroyeth before you face , so shall ye perish ; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the lord you god .
hear , o israel : thou art to pass over jordan this day , to go in to possess nation greater and mightier than thyself , city great and fence up to heaven ,
a people great and tall , the child of the anakims , whom thou knowest , and of whom thou hast hear say , who can stand before the child of anak !
understand therefore this day , that the lord thy god be he which goeth over before thee ; as a consuming fire he shall destroy they , and he shall bring they down before thy face : so shalt thou drive they out , and destroy they quickly , as the lord have say unto thee .
speak not thou in thine heart , after that the lord thy god have cast they out from before thee , say , for my righteousness the lord have bring i in to possess this land : but for the wickedness of these nation the lord doth drive they out from before thee .
not for thy righteousness , or for the uprightness of thine heart , dost thou go to possess they land : but for the wickedness of these nation the lord thy god doth drive they out from before thee , and that he may perform the word which the lord sware unto thy father , abraham , isaac , and jacob .
understand therefore , that the lord thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness ; for thou art a stiffnecked people .
remember , and forget not , how thou provokedst the lord thy god to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of egypt , until ye come unto this place , ye have be rebellious against the lord .
also in horeb ye provoke the lord to wrath , so that the lord be angry with you to have destroy you .
when i be go up into the mount to receive the table of stone , even the table of the covenant which the lord make with you , then i abide in the mount forty day and forty night , i neither do eat bread nor drink water :
and the lord deliver unto i two table of stone write with the finger of god ; and on they be write accord to all the word , which the lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
and it come to pass at the end of forty day and forty night , that the lord give i the two table of stone , even the table of the covenant .
and the lord say unto i , arise , get thee down quickly from hence ; for thy people which thou hast bring forth out of egypt have corrupt themselves ; they be quickly turn aside out of the way which i command they ; they have make they a molten image .
furthermore the lord speak unto i , say , i have see this people , and , behold , it be a stiffnecked people :
let i alone , that i may destroy they , and blot out they name from under heaven : and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they .
so i turn and come down from the mount , and the mount burn with fire : and the two table of the covenant be in my two hand .
and i look , and , behold , ye have sin against the lord you god , and have make you a molten calf : ye have turn aside quickly out of the way which the lord have command you .
and i take the two table , and cast they out of my two hand , and brake they before you eye .
and i fall down before the lord , as at the first , forty day and forty night : i do neither eat bread , nor drink water , because of all you sin which ye sin , in do wickedly in the sight of the lord , to provoke he to anger .
for i be afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , wherewith the lord be wroth against you to destroy you .
but the lord hearken unto i at that time also .
and the lord be very angry with aaron to have destroy he : and i pray for aaron also the same time .
and i take you sin , the calf which ye have make , and burn it with fire , and stamp it , and ground it very small , even until it be as small as dust : and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descend out of the mount .
and at taberah , and at massah , and at kibrothhattaavah , ye provoke the lord to wrath .
likewise when the lord send you from kadeshbarnea , say , go up and possess the land which i have give you ; then ye rebel against the commandment of the lord you god , and ye believe he not , nor hearken to he voice .
ye have be rebellious against the lord from the day that i know you .
thus i fall down before the lord forty day and forty night , as i fall down at the first ; because the lord have say he would destroy you .
i pray therefore unto the lord , and say , o lord god , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeem through thy greatness , which thou hast bring forth out of egypt with a mighty hand .
remember thy servant , abraham , isaac , and jacob ; look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to they wickedness , nor to they sin :
lest the land whence thou broughtest we out say , because the lord be not able to bring they into the land which he promise they , and because he hate they , he have bring they out to slay they in the wilderness .
yet they be thy people and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretch out arm .
at that time the lord say unto i , hew thee two table of stone like unto the first , and come up unto i into the mount , and make thee a ark of wood .
and i will write on the table the word that be in the first table which thou brakest , and thou shalt put they in the ark .
and i make a ark of shittim wood , and hew two table of stone like unto the first , and go up into the mount , have the two table in mine hand .
and he write on the table , accord to the first writing , the ten commandment , which the lord speak unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the lord give they unto i .
and i turn myself and come down from the mount , and put the table in the ark which i have make ; and there they be , as the lord command i .
and the child of israel take they journey from beeroth of the child of jaakan to mosera : there aaron die , and there he be bury ; and eleazar he son minister in the priest 's office in he stead .
from thence they journey unto gudgodah ; and from gudgodah to jotbath , a land of river of water .
at that time the lord separate the tribe of levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord , to stand before the lord to minister unto he , and to bless in he name , unto this day .
wherefore levi have no part nor inheritance with he brethren ; the lord be he inheritance , accord as the lord thy god promise he .
and i stay in the mount , accord to the first time , forty day and forty night ; and the lord hearken unto i at that time also , and the lord would not destroy thee .
and the lord say unto i , arise , take thy journey before the people , that they may go in and possess the land , which i sware unto they father to give unto they .
and now , israel , what doth the lord thy god require of thee , but to fear the lord thy god , to walk in all he way , and to love he , and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul ,
to keep the commandment of the lord , and he statute , which i command thee this day for thy good ?
behold , the heaven and the heaven of heaven be the lord 's thy god , the earth also , with all that therein be .
only the lord have a delight in thy father to love they , and he choose they seed after they , even you above all people , as it be this day .
circumcise therefore the foreskin of you heart , and be no more stiffnecked .
for the lord you god be god of god , and lord of lord , a great god , a mighty , and a terrible , which regardeth not person , nor taketh reward :
he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow , and loveth the stranger , in give he food and raiment .
love ye therefore the stranger : for ye be stranger in the land of egypt .
thou shalt fear the lord thy god ; he shalt thou serve , and to he shalt thou cleave , and swear by he name .
he be thy praise , and he be thy god , that have do for thee these great and terrible thing , which thine eye have see .
thy father go down into egypt with threescore and ten person ; and now the lord thy god have make thee as the star of heaven for multitude .
therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god , and keep he charge , and he statute , and he judgment , and he commandment , alway .
and know ye this day : for i speak not with you child which have not know , and which have not see the chastisement of the lord you god , he greatness , he mighty hand , and he stretch out arm ,
and he miracle , and he act , which he do in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt , and unto all he land ;
and what he do unto the army of egypt , unto they horse , and to they chariot ; how he make the water of the red sea to overflow they as they pursue after you , and how the lord have destroy they unto this day ;
and what he do unto you in the wilderness , until ye come into this place ;
and what he do unto dathan and abiram , the son of eliab , the son of reuben : how the earth open she mouth , and swallow they up , and they household , and they tent , and all the substance that be in they possession , in the midst of all israel :
but you eye have see all the great act of the lord which he do .
therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which i command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land , whither ye go to possess it ;
and that ye may prolong you day in the land , which the lord sware unto you father to give unto they and to they seed , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
for the land , whither thou goest in to possess it , be not as the land of egypt , from whence ye come out , where thou sowedst thy seed , and wateredst it with thy foot , as a garden of herb :
but the land , whither ye go to possess it , be a land of hill and valley , and drinketh water of the rain of heaven :
a land which the lord thy god careth for : the eye of the lord thy god be always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandment which i command you this day , to love the lord you god , and to serve he with all you heart and with all you soul ,
that i will give you the rain of you land in he due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that thou mayest gather in thy corn , and thy wine , and thine oil .
and i will send grass in thy field for thy cattle , that thou mayest eat and be full .
take heed to yourselve , that you heart be not deceive , and ye turn aside , and serve other god , and worship they ;
and then the lord 's wrath be kindle against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not she fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you .
therefore shall ye lay up these my word in you heart and in you soul , and bind they for a sign upon you hand , that they may be as frontlet between you eye .
and ye shall teach they you child , speaking of they when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
and thou shalt write they upon the door post of thine house , and upon thy gate :
that you day may be multiply , and the day of you child , in the land which the lord sware unto you father to give they , as the day of heaven upon the earth .
for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandment which i command you , to do they , to love the lord you god , to walk in all he way , and to cleave unto he ;
then will the lord drive out all these nation from before you , and ye shall possess greater nation and mightier than yourselve .
every place whereon the sole of you foot shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness and lebanon , from the river , the river euphrates , even unto the uttermost sea shall you coast be .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the lord you god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he have say unto you .
behold , i set before you this day a blessing and a curse ;
a blessing , if ye obey the commandment of the lord you god , which i command you this day :
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandment of the lord you god , but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day , to go after other god , which ye have not know .
and it shall come to pass , when the lord thy god have bring thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount gerizim , and the curse upon mount ebal .
be they not on the other side jordan , by the way where the sun goeth down , in the land of the canaanites , which dwell in the champaign over against gilgal , beside the plain of moreh ?
for ye shall pass over jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord you god giveth you , and ye shall possess it , and dwell therein .
and ye shall observe to do all the statute and judgment which i set before you this day .
these be the statute and judgment , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the lord god of thy father giveth thee to possess it , all the day that ye live upon the earth .
ye shall utterly destroy all the place , wherein the nation which ye shall possess serve they god , upon the high mountain , and upon the hill , and under every green tree :
and ye shall overthrow they altar , and break they pillar , and burn they grove with fire ; and ye shall hew down the graven image of they god , and destroy the name of they out of that place .
ye shall not do so unto the lord you god .
but unto the place which the lord you god shall choose out of all you tribe to put he name there , even unto he habitation shall ye seek , and thither thou shalt come :
and thither ye shall bring you burnt offering , and you sacrifice , and you tithe , and heave offering of you hand , and you vow , and you freewill offering , and the firstling of you herd and of you flock :
and there ye shall eat before the lord you god , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put you hand unto , ye and you household , wherein the lord thy god have bless thee .
ye shall not do after all the thing that we do here this day , every man whatsoever be right in he own eye .
for ye be not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance , which the lord you god giveth you .
but when ye go over jordan , and dwell in the land which the lord you god giveth you to inherit , and when he giveth you rest from all you enemy round about , so that ye dwell in safety ;
then there shall be a place which the lord you god shall choose to cause he name to dwell there ; thither shall ye bring all that i command you ; you burnt offering , and you sacrifice , you tithe , and the heave offering of you hand , and all you choice vow which ye vow unto the lord :
and ye shall rejoice before the lord you god , ye , and you son , and you daughter , and you manservant , and you maidservant , and the levite that be within you gate ; forasmuch as he have no part nor inheritance with you .
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offering in every place that thou seest :
but in the place which the lord shall choose in one of thy tribe , there thou shalt offer thy burnt offering , and there thou shalt do all that i command thee .
notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gate , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after , accord to the blessing of the lord thy god which he have give thee : the unclean and the clean may eat thereof , as of the roebuck , and as of the hart .
only ye shall not eat the blood ; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water .
thou mayest not eat within thy gate the tithe of thy corn , or of thy wine , or of thy oil , or the firstling of thy herd or of thy flock , nor any of thy vow which thou vowest , nor thy freewill offering , or heave offering of thine hand :
but thou must eat they before the lord thy god in the place which the lord thy god shall choose , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the levite that be within thy gate : and thou shalt rejoice before the lord thy god in all that thou puttest thine hand unto .
take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as thou livest upon the earth .
when the lord thy god shall enlarge thy border , as he have promise thee , and thou shalt say , i will eat flesh , because thy soul longeth to eat flesh ; thou mayest eat flesh , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after .
if the place which the lord thy god have choose to put he name there be too far from thee , then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock , which the lord have give thee , as i have command thee , and thou shalt eat in thy gate whatsoever thy soul lusteth after .
even as the roebuck and the hart be eat , so thou shalt eat they : the unclean and the clean shall eat of they alike .
only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood be the life ; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh .
thou shalt not eat it ; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water .
thou shalt not eat it ; that it may go well with thee , and with thy child after thee , when thou shalt do that which be right in the sight of the lord .
only thy holy thing which thou hast , and thy vow , thou shalt take , and go unto the place which the lord shall choose :
and thou shalt offer thy burnt offering , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the lord thy god : and the blood of thy sacrifice shall be pour out upon the altar of the lord thy god , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
observe and hear all these word which i command thee , that it may go well with thee , and with thy child after thee for ever , when thou doest that which be good and right in the sight of the lord thy god .
when the lord thy god shall cut off the nation from before thee , whither thou goest to possess they , and thou succeedest they , and dwellest in they land ;
take heed to thyself that thou be not snare by follow they , after that they be destroy from before thee ; and that thou enquire not after they god , say , how do these nation serve they god ? even so will i do likewise .
thou shalt not do so unto the lord thy god : for every abomination to the lord , which he hateth , have they do unto they god ; for even they son and they daughter they have burn in the fire to they god .
what thing soever i command you , observe to do it : thou shalt not add thereto , nor diminish from it .
if there arise among you a prophet , or a dreamer of dream , and giveth thee a sign or a wonder ,
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , whereof he speak unto thee , say , let we go after other god , which thou hast not know , and let we serve they ;
thou shalt not hearken unto the word of that prophet , or that dreamer of dream : for the lord you god proveth you , to know whether ye love the lord you god with all you heart and with all you soul .
ye shall walk after the lord you god , and fear he , and keep he commandment , and obey he voice , and ye shall serve he , and cleave unto he .
and that prophet , or that dreamer of dream , shall be put to death ; because he have speak to turn you away from the lord you god , which bring you out of the land of egypt , and redeem you out of the house of bondage , to thrust thee out of the way which the lord thy god command thee to walk in .
so shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee .
if thy brother , the son of thy mother , or thy son , or thy daughter , or the wife of thy bosom , or thy friend , which be as thine own soul , entice thee secretly , say , let we go and serve other god , which thou hast not know , thou , nor thy father ;
namely , of the god of the people which be round about you , nigh unto thee , or far off from thee , from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth ;
thou shalt not consent unto he , nor hearken unto he ; neither shall thine eye pity he , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceal he :
but thou shalt surely kill he ; thine hand shall be first upon he to put he to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
and thou shalt stone he with stone , that he die ; because he have seek to thrust thee away from the lord thy god , which bring thee out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage .
and all israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such wickedness as this be among you .
if thou shalt hear say in one of thy city , which the lord thy god have give thee to dwell there , say ,
certain man , the child of belial , be go out from among you , and have withdraw the inhabitant of they city , say , let we go and serve other god , which ye have not know ;
then shalt thou enquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination be work among you ;
thou shalt surely smite the inhabitant of that city with the edge of the sword , destroy it utterly , and all that be therein , and the cattle thereof , with the edge of the sword .
and thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof , and shalt burn with fire the city , and all the spoil thereof every whit , for the lord thy god : and it shall be a heap for ever ; it shall not be build again .
and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand : that the lord may turn from the fierceness of he anger , and shew thee mercy , and have compassion upon thee , and multiply thee , as he have swear unto thy father ;
when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the lord thy god , to keep all he commandment which i command thee this day , to do that which be right in the eye of the lord thy god .
ye be the child of the lord you god : ye shall not cut yourselve , nor make any baldness between you eye for the dead .
for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god , and the lord have choose thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nation that be upon the earth .
thou shalt not eat any abominable thing .
these be the beast which ye shall eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ,
the hart , and the roebuck , and the fallow deer , and the wild goat , and the pygarg , and the wild ox , and the chamoix .
and every beast that parteth the hoof , and cleaveth the cleft into two claw , and cheweth the cud among the beast , that ye shall eat .
nevertheless these ye shall not eat of they that chew the cud , or of they that divide the cloven hoof ; as the camel , and the hare , and the coney : for they chew the cud , but divide not the hoof ; therefore they be unclean unto you .
and the swine , because it divideth the hoof , yet cheweth not the cud , it be unclean unto you : ye shall not eat of they flesh , nor touch they dead carcase .
these ye shall eat of all that be in the water : all that have fin and scale shall ye eat :
and whatsoever have not fin and scale ye may not eat ; it be unclean unto you .
of all clean bird ye shall eat .
but these be they of which ye shall not eat : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray ,
and the glede , and the kite , and the vulture after he kind ,
and every raven after he kind ,
and the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after he kind ,
the little owl , and the great owl , and the swan ,
and the pelican , and the gier eagle , and the cormorant ,
and the stork , and the heron after she kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
and every creep thing that flieth be unclean unto you : they shall not be eat .
but of all clean fowl ye may eat .
ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself : thou shalt give it unto the stranger that be in thy gate , that he may eat it ; or thou mayest sell it unto a alien : for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god .
thou shalt not seethe a kid in he mother 's milk .
thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed , that the field bringeth forth year by year .
and thou shalt eat before the lord thy god , in the place which he shall choose to place he name there , the tithe of thy corn , of thy wine , and of thine oil , and the firstling of thy herd and of thy flock ; that thou mayest learn to fear the lord thy god always .
and if the way be too long for thee , so that thou art not able to carry it ; or if the place be too far from thee , which the lord thy god shall choose to set he name there , when the lord thy god have bless thee :
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose :
and thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after , for ox , or for sheep , or for wine , or for strong drink , or for whatsoever thy soul desireth : and thou shalt eat there before the lord thy god , and thou shalt rejoice , thou , and thine household ,
and the levite that be within thy gate ; thou shalt not forsake he ; for he have no part nor inheritance with thee .
at the end of three year thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gate :
and the levite , ( because he have no part nor inheritance with thee , ) and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , which be within thy gate , shall come , and shall eat and be satisfy ; that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest .
at the end of every seven year thou shalt make a release .
and this be the manner of the release : every creditor that lendeth ought unto he neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of he neighbour , or of he brother ; because it be call the lord 's release .
of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again : but that which be thine with thy brother thine hand shall release ;
save when there shall be no poor among you ; for the lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for a inheritance to possess it :
only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god , to observe to do all these commandment which i command thee this day .
for the lord thy god blesseth thee , as he promise thee : and thou shalt lend unto many nation , but thou shalt not borrow ; and thou shalt reign over many nation , but they shall not reign over thee .
if there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gate in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thine heart , nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother :
but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto he , and shalt surely lend he sufficient for he need , in that which he wanteth .
beware that there be not a think in thy wicked heart , say , the seventh year , the year of release , be at hand ; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother , and thou givest he nought ; and he cry unto the lord against thee , and it be sin unto thee .
thou shalt surely give he , and thine heart shall not be grieve when thou givest unto he : because that for this thing the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thy work , and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore i command thee , say , thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy needy , in thy land .
and if thy brother , a hebrew man , or a hebrew woman , be sell unto thee , and serve thee six year ; then in the seventh year thou shalt let he go free from thee .
and when thou sendest he out free from thee , thou shalt not let he go away empty :
thou shalt furnish he liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress : of that wherewith the lord thy god have bless thee thou shalt give unto he .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt , and the lord thy god redeem thee : therefore i command thee this thing to day .
and it shall be , if he say unto thee , i will not go away from thee ; because he loveth thee and thine house , because he be well with thee ;
then thou shalt take a aul , and thrust it through he ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever .
and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
it shall not seem hard unto thee , when thou sendest he away free from thee ; for he have be worth a double hire servant to thee , in serve thee six year : and the lord thy god shall bless thee in all that thou doest .
all the firstle male that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the lord thy god : thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock , nor shear the firstling of thy sheep .
thou shalt eat it before the lord thy god year by year in the place which the lord shall choose , thou and thy household .
and if there be any blemish therein , as if it be lame , or blind , or have any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the lord thy god .
thou shalt eat it within thy gate : the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike , as the roebuck , and as the hart .
only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof ; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water .
observe the month of abib , and keep the passover unto the lord thy god : for in the month of abib the lord thy god bring thee forth out of egypt by night .
thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god , of the flock and the herd , in the place which the lord shall choose to place he name there .
thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it ; seven day shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith , even the bread of affliction ; for thou camest forth out of the land of egypt in haste : that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of egypt all the day of thy life .
and there shall be no leavened bread see with thee in all thy coast seven day ; neither shall there any thing of the flesh , which thou sacrificedst the first day at even , remain all night until the morning .
thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gate , which the lord thy god giveth thee :
but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place he name in , there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even , at the go down of the sun , at the season that thou camest forth out of egypt .
and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the lord thy god shall choose : and thou shalt turn in the morning , and go unto thy tent .
six day thou shalt eat unleavened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the lord thy god : thou shalt do no work therein .
seven week shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven week from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn .
and thou shalt keep the feast of week unto the lord thy god with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand , which thou shalt give unto the lord thy god , accord as the lord thy god have bless thee :
and thou shalt rejoice before the lord thy god , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the levite that be within thy gate , and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that be among you , in the place which the lord thy god have choose to place he name there .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt : and thou shalt observe and do these statute .
thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacle seven day , after that thou hast gather in thy corn and thy wine :
and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the levite , the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that be within thy gate .
seven day shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the lord thy god in the place which the lord shall choose : because the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thine increase , and in all the work of thine hand , therefore thou shalt surely rejoice .
three time in a year shall all thy male appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose ; in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of week , and in the feast of tabernacle : and they shall not appear before the lord empty :
every man shall give as he be able , accord to the blessing of the lord thy god which he have give thee .
judges and officer shalt thou make thee in all thy gate , which the lord thy god giveth thee , throughout thy tribe : and they shall judge the people with just judgment .
thou shalt not wrest judgment ; thou shalt not respect person , neither take a gift : for a gift doth blind the eye of the wise , and pervert the word of the righteous .
that which be altogether just shalt thou follow , that thou mayest live , and inherit the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any tree near unto the altar of the lord thy god , which thou shalt make thee .
neither shalt thou set thee up any image ; which the lord thy god hateth .
thou shalt not sacrifice unto the lord thy god any bullock , or sheep , wherein be blemish , or any evilfavouredness : for that be a abomination unto the lord thy god .
if there be find among you , within any of thy gate which the lord thy god giveth thee , man or woman , that have work wickedness in the sight of the lord thy god , in transgress he covenant ,
and have go and serve other god , and worship they , either the sun , or moon , or any of the host of heaven , which i have not command ;
and it be tell thee , and thou hast hear of it , and enquire diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination be work in israel :
then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman , which have commit that wicked thing , unto thy gate , even that man or that woman , and shalt stone they with stone , till they die .
at the mouth of two witness , or three witness , shall he that be worthy of death be put to death ; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hand of the witness shall be first upon he to put he to death , and afterward the hand of all the people .
so thou shalt put the evil away from among you .
if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , be matter of controversy within thy gate : then shalt thou arise , and get thee up into the place which the lord thy god shall choose ;
and thou shalt come unto the priest the levites , and unto the judge that shall be in those day , and enquire ; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment :
and thou shalt do accord to the sentence , which they of that place which the lord shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do accord to all that they inform thee :
accord to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee , and accord to the judgment which they shall tell thee , thou shalt do : thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee , to the right hand , nor to the left .
and the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the lord thy god , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from israel .
and all the people shall hear , and fear , and do no more presumptuously .
when thou art come unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee , and shalt possess it , and shalt dwell therein , and shalt say , i will set a king over i , like as all the nation that be about i ;
thou shalt in any wise set he king over thee , whom the lord thy god shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which be not thy brother .
but he shall not multiply horse to himself , nor cause the people to return to egypt , to the end that he should multiply horse : forasmuch as the lord have say unto you , ye shall henceforth return no more that way .
neither shall he multiply wife to himself , that he heart turn not away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
and it shall be , when he sitteth upon the throne of he kingdom , that he shall write he a copy of this law in a book out of that which be before the priest the levites :
and it shall be with he , and he shall read therein all the day of he life : that he may learn to fear the lord he god , to keep all the word of this law and these statute , to do they :
that he heart be not lift up above he brethren , and that he turn not aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong he day in he kingdom , he , and he child , in the midst of israel .
the priest the levites , and all the tribe of levi , shall have no part nor inheritance with israel : they shall eat the offering of the lord make by fire , and he inheritance .
therefore shall they have no inheritance among they brethren : the lord be they inheritance , as he have say unto they .
and this shall be the priest 's due from the people , from they that offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep ; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder , and the two cheek , and the maw .
the firstfruit also of thy corn , of thy wine , and of thine oil , and the first of the fleece of thy sheep , shalt thou give he .
for the lord thy god have choose he out of all thy tribe , to stand to minister in the name of the lord , he and he son for ever .
and if a levite come from any of thy gate out of all israel , where he sojourn , and come with all the desire of he mind unto the place which the lord shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of the lord he god , as all he brethren the levites do , which stand there before the lord .
they shall have like portion to eat , beside that which cometh of the sale of he patrimony .
when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god giveth thee , thou shalt not learn to do after the abomination of those nation .
there shall not be find among you any one that maketh he son or he daughter to pass through the fire , or that useth divination , or a observer of time , or a enchanter , or a witch .
or a charmer , or a consulter with familiar spirit , or a wizard , or a necromancer .
for all that do these thing be a abomination unto the lord : and because of these abomination the lord thy god doth drive they out from before thee .
thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy god .
for these nation , which thou shalt possess , hearken unto observer of time , and unto diviner : but as for thee , the lord thy god have not suffer thee so to do .
the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like unto i ; unto he ye shall hearken ;
accord to all that thou desiredst of the lord thy god in horeb in the day of the assembly , say , let i not hear again the voice of the lord my god , neither let i see this great fire any more , that i die not .
and the lord say unto i , they have well speak that which they have speak .
i will raise they up a prophet from among they brethren , like unto thee , and will put my word in he mouth ; and he shall speak unto they all that i shall command he .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever will not hearken unto my word which he shall speak in my name , i will require it of he .
but the prophet , which shall presume to speak a word in my name , which i have not command he to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other god , even that prophet shall die .
and if thou say in thine heart , how shall we know the word which the lord have not speak ?
when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord , if the thing follow not , nor come to pass , that be the thing which the lord have not speak , but the prophet have speak it presumptuously : thou shalt not be afraid of he .
when the lord thy god have cut off the nation , whose land the lord thy god giveth thee , and thou succeedest they , and dwellest in they city , and in they house ;
thou shalt separate three city for thee in the midst of thy land , which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it .
thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the coast of thy land , which the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit , into three part , that every slayer may flee thither .
and this be the case of the slayer , which shall flee thither , that he may live : whoso killeth he neighbour ignorantly , whom he hate not in time past ;
as when a man goeth into the wood with he neighbour to hew wood , and he hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree , and the head slippeth from the helve , and lighteth upon he neighbour , that he die ; he shall flee unto one of those city , and live :
lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer , while he heart be hot , and overtake he , because the way be long , and slay he ; whereas he be not worthy of death , inasmuch as he hate he not in time past .
wherefore i command thee , say , thou shalt separate three city for thee .
and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast , as he have swear unto thy father , and give thee all the land which he promise to give unto thy father ;
if thou shalt keep all these commandment to do they , which i command thee this day , to love the lord thy god , and to walk ever in he way ; then shalt thou add three city more for thee , beside these three :
that innocent blood be not shed in thy land , which the lord thy god giveth thee for a inheritance , and so blood be upon thee .
but if any man hate he neighbour , and lie in wait for he , and rise up against he , and smite he mortally that he die , and fleeth into one of these city :
then the elder of he city shall send and fetch he thence , and deliver he into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
thine eye shall not pity he , but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from israel , that it may go well with thee .
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it .
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sinneth : at the mouth of two witness , or at the mouth of three witness , shall the matter be establish .
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against he that which be wrong ;
then both the man , between whom the controversy be , shall stand before the lord , before the priest and the judge , which shall be in those day ;
and the judge shall make diligent inquisition : and , behold , if the witness be a false witness , and have testify falsely against he brother ;
then shall ye do unto he , as he have think to have do unto he brother : so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
and those which remain shall hear , and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you .
and thine eye shall not pity ; but life shall go for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemy , and seest horse , and chariot , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of they : for the lord thy god be with thee , which bring thee up out of the land of egypt .
and it shall be , when ye be come nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people ,
and shall say unto they , hear , o israel , ye approach this day unto battle against you enemy : let not you heart faint , fear not , and do not tremble , neither be ye terrify because of they ;
for the lord you god be he that goeth with you , to fight for you against you enemy , to save you .
and the officer shall speak unto the people , say , what man be there that have build a new house , and have not dedicate it ? let he go and return to he house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
and what man be he that have plant a vineyard , and have not yet eat of it ? let he also go and return unto he house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and what man be there that have betroth a wife , and have not take she ? let he go and return unto he house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take she .
and the officer shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , what man be there that be fearful and faintheart ? let he go and return unto he house , lest he brethren 's heart faint as well as he heart .
and it shall be , when the officer have make a end of speak unto the people , that they shall make captain of the army to lead the people .
when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace unto it .
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that be find therein shall be tributary unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
and if it will make no peace with thee , but will make war against thee , then thou shalt besiege it :
and when the lord thy god have deliver it into thine hand , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
but the woman , and the little one , and the cattle , and all that be in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemy , which the lord thy god have give thee .
thus shalt thou do unto all the city which be very far off from thee , which be not of the city of these nation .
but of the city of these people , which the lord thy god doth give thee for a inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth :
but thou shalt utterly destroy they ; namely , the hittites , and the amorites , the canaanites , and the perizzites , the hivites , and the jebusites ; as the lord thy god have command thee :
that they teach you not to do after all they abomination , which they have do unto they god ; so should ye sin against the lord you god .
when thou shalt besiege a city a long time , in make war against it to take it , thou shalt not destroy the tree thereof by force a axe against they : for thou mayest eat of they , and thou shalt not cut they down ( for the tree of the field be man 's life ) to employ they in the siege :
only the tree which thou knowest that they be not tree for meat , thou shalt destroy and cut they down ; and thou shalt build bulwark against the city that maketh war with thee , until it be subdue .
if one be find slay in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it , lie in the field , and it be not know who have slay he :
then thy elder and thy judge shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the city which be round about he that be slay :
and it shall be , that the city which be next unto the slay man , even the elder of that city shall take a heifer , which have not be work with , and which have not draw in the yoke ;
and the elder of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley , which be neither eared nor sown , and shall strike off the heifer 's neck there in the valley :
and the priest the son of levi shall come near ; for they the lord thy god have choose to minister unto he , and to bless in the name of the lord ; and by they word shall every controversy and every stroke be try :
and all the elder of that city , that be next unto the slay man , shall wash they hand over the heifer that be behead in the valley :
and they shall answer and say , we hand have not shed this blood , neither have we eye see it .
be merciful , o lord , unto thy people israel , whom thou hast redeem , and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of israel 's charge .
and the blood shall be forgive they .
so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you , when thou shalt do that which be right in the sight of the lord .
when thou goest forth to war against thine enemy , and the lord thy god have deliver they into thine hand , and thou hast take they captive ,
and seest among the captive a beautiful woman , and hast a desire unto she , that thou wouldest have she to thy wife ;
then thou shalt bring she home to thine house ; and she shall shave she head , and pare she nail ;
and she shall put the raiment of she captivity from off she , and shall remain in thine house , and bewail she father and she mother a full month : and after that thou shalt go in unto she , and be she husband , and she shall be thy wife .
and it shall be , if thou have no delight in she , then thou shalt let she go whither she will ; but thou shalt not sell she at all for money , thou shalt not make merchandise of she , because thou hast humble she .
if a man have two wife , one beloved , and another hate , and they have bear he child , both the beloved and the hate ; and if the firstborn son be hers that be hate :
then it shall be , when he maketh he son to inherit that which he have , that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hate , which be indeed the firstborn :
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hate for the firstborn , by give he a double portion of all that he have : for he be the beginning of he strength ; the right of the firstborn be he .
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of he father , or the voice of he mother , and that , when they have chasten he , will not hearken unto they :
then shall he father and he mother lay hold on he , and bring he out unto the elder of he city , and unto the gate of he place ;
and they shall say unto the elder of he city , this we son be stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey we voice ; he be a glutton , and a drunkard .
and all the man of he city shall stone he with stone , that he die : so shalt thou put evil away from among you ; and all israel shall hear , and fear .
and if a man have commit a sin worthy of death , and he be to be put to death , and thou hang he on a tree :
he body shall not remain all night upon the tree , but thou shalt in any wise bury he that day ; ( for he that be hang be accurse of god ; ) that thy land be not defile , which the lord thy god giveth thee for a inheritance .
thou shalt not see thy brother 's ox or he sheep go astray , and hide thyself from they : thou shalt in any case bring they again unto thy brother .
and if thy brother be not nigh unto thee , or if thou know he not , then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house , and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it , and thou shalt restore it to he again .
in like manner shalt thou do with he ass ; and so shalt thou do with he raiment ; and with all lose thing of thy brother 's , which he have lose , and thou hast find , shalt thou do likewise : thou mayest not hide thyself .
thou shalt not see thy brother 's ass or he ox fall down by the way , and hide thyself from they : thou shalt surely help he to lift they up again .
the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's garment : for all that do so be abomination unto the lord thy god .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young one , or egg , and the dam sit upon the young , or upon the egg , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go , and take the young to thee ; that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy day .

thou shalt make thee fringe upon the four quarter of thy vesture , wherewith thou coverest thyself .
if any man take a wife , and go in unto she , and hate she ,
and give occasion of speech against she , and bring up a evil name upon she , and say , i take this woman , and when i come to she , i find she not a maid :
then shall the father of the damsel , and she mother , take and bring forth the token of the damsel 's virginity unto the elder of the city in the gate :
and the damsel 's father shall say unto the elder , i give my daughter unto this man to wife , and he hateth she ;
and , lo , he have give occasion of speech against she , say , i find not thy daughter a maid ; and yet these be the token of my daughter 's virginity .
and they shall spread the cloth before the elder of the city .
and the elder of that city shall take that man and chastise he ;
and they shall amerce he in a hundred shekel of silver , and give they unto the father of the damsel , because he have bring up a evil name upon a virgin of israel : and she shall be he wife ; he may not put she away all he day .
but if this thing be true , and the token of virginity be not find for the damsel :

but if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field , and the man force she , and lie with she : then the man only that lay with she shall die :
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there be in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against he neighbour , and slayeth he , even so be this matter :
for he find she in the field , and the betrothed damsel cry , and there be none to save she .
if a man find a damsel that be a virgin , which be not betroth , and lay hold on she , and lie with she , and they be find ;

thou shalt have a place also without the camp , whither thou shalt go forth abroad :
and thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon ; and it shall be , when thou wilt ease thyself abroad , thou shalt dig therewith , and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee :

but it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god , to observe to do all he commandment and he statute which i command thee this day ; that all these curse shall come upon thee , and overtake thee :
cursed shalt thou be in the city , and curse shalt thou be in the field .
cursed shall be thy basket and thy store .
cursed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy land , the increase of thy kine , and the flock of thy sheep .
cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and curse shalt thou be when thou goest out .
the lord shall send upon thee cursing , vexation , and rebuke , in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do , until thou be destroy , and until thou perish quickly ; because of the wickedness of thy doings , whereby thou hast forsake i .
the lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee , until he have consume thee from off the land , whither thou goest to possess it .
the lord shall smite thee with a consumption , and with a fever , and with a inflammation , and with a extreme burning , and with the sword , and with blast , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish .
and thy heaven that be over thy head shall be brass , and the earth that be under thee shall be iron .
the lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust : from heaven shall it come down upon thee , until thou be destroy .
the lord shall cause thee to be smite before thine enemy : thou shalt go out one way against they , and flee seven way before they : and shalt be remove into all the kingdom of the earth .
and thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowl of the air , and unto the beast of the earth , and no man shall fray they away .
the lord will smite thee with the botch of egypt , and with the emerod , and with the scab , and with the itch , whereof thou canst not be heal .
the lord shall smite thee with madness , and blindness , and astonishment of heart :
and thou shalt grope at noonday , as the blind gropeth in darkness , and thou shalt not prosper in thy way : and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoil evermore , and no man shall save thee .
thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with she : thou shalt build a house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grape thereof .
thine ox shall be slay before thine eye , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently take away from before thy face , and shall not be restore to thee : thy sheep shall be give unto thine enemy , and thou shalt have none to rescue they .
thy son and thy daughter shall be give unto another people , and thine eye shall look , and fail with longing for they all the day long : and there shall be no might in thine hand :
the fruit of thy land , and all thy labour , shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway :
so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eye which thou shalt see .
the lord shall smite thee in the knee , and in the leg , with a sore botch that can not be heal , from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head .
the lord shall bring thee , and thy king which thou shalt set over thee , unto a nation which neither thou nor thy father have know ; and there shalt thou serve other god , wood and stone .
and thou shalt become a astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all nation whither the lord shall lead thee .
thou shalt carry much seed out into the field , and shalt gather but little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
thou shalt plant vineyard , and dress they , but shalt neither drink of the wine , nor gather the grape ; for the worm shall eat they .
thou shalt have olive tree throughout all thy coast , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast he fruit .
thou shalt beget son and daughter , but thou shalt not enjoy they ; for they shall go into captivity .
all thy tree and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume .
the stranger that be within thee shall get up above thee very high ; and thou shalt come down very low .
he shall lend to thee , and thou shalt not lend to he : he shall be the head , and thou shalt be the tail .
moreover all these curse shall come upon thee , and shall pursue thee , and overtake thee , till thou be destroy ; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the lord thy god , to keep he commandment and he statute which he command thee :
and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder , and upon thy seed for ever .
because thou servedst not the lord thy god with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , for the abundance of all thing ;
therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy which the lord shall send against thee , in hunger , and in thirst , and in nakedness , and in want of all thing : and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck , until he have destroy thee .
the lord shall bring a nation against thee from far , from the end of the earth , as swift as the eagle flieth ; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand ;
a nation of fierce countenance , which shall not regard the person of the old , nor shew favour to the young :
and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle , and the fruit of thy land , until thou be destroy : which also shall not leave thee either corn , wine , or oil , or the increase of thy kine , or flock of thy sheep , until he have destroy thee .
and he shall besiege thee in all thy gate , until thy high and fenced wall come down , wherein thou trustedst , throughout all thy land : and he shall besiege thee in all thy gate throughout all thy land , which the lord thy god have give thee .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body , the flesh of thy son and of thy daughter , which the lord thy god have give thee , in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee :
so that the man that be tender among you , and very delicate , he eye shall be evil toward he brother , and toward the wife of he bosom , and toward the remnant of he child which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of they of the flesh of he child whom he shall eat : because he have nothing leave he in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in all thy gate .
the tender and delicate woman among you , which would not adventure to set the sole of she foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness , she eye shall be evil toward the husband of she bosom , and toward she son , and toward she daughter ,
and toward she young one that cometh out from between she foot , and toward she child which she shall bear : for she shall eat they for want of all thing secretly in the siege and straitness , wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gate .
if thou wilt not observe to do all the word of this law that be write in this book , that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name , the lord thy god ;
then the lord will make thy plague wonderful , and the plague of thy seed , even great plague , and of long continuance , and sore sickness , and of long continuance .
moreover he will bring upon thee all the disease of egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
also every sickness , and every plague , which be not write in the book of this law , they will the lord bring upon thee , until thou be destroy .
and ye shall be leave few in number , whereas ye be as the star of heaven for multitude ; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the lord thy god .
and it shall come to pass , that as the lord rejoice over you to do you good , and to multiply you ; so the lord will rejoice over you to destroy you , and to bring you to nought ; and ye shall be pluck from off the land whither thou goest to possess it .
and the lord shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other god , which neither thou nor thy father have know , even wood and stone .
and among these nation shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest : but the lord shall give thee there a tremble heart , and fail of eye , and sorrow of mind :
and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee ; and thou shalt fear day and night , and shalt have none assurance of thy life :
in the morning thou shalt say , would god it be even ! and at even thou shalt say , would god it be morning ! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear , and for the sight of thine eye which thou shalt see .
and the lord shall bring thee into egypt again with ship , by the way whereof i speak unto thee , thou shalt see it no more again : and there ye shall be sell unto you enemy for bondman and bondwoman , and no man shall buy you .
these be the word of the covenant , which the lord command moses to make with the child of israel in the land of moab , beside the covenant which he make with they in horeb .
and moses call unto all israel , and say unto they , ye have see all that the lord do before you eye in the land of egypt unto pharaoh , and unto all he servant , and unto all he land ;
the great temptation which thine eye have see , the sign , and those great miracle :
yet the lord have not give you a heart to perceive , and eye to see , and ear to hear , unto this day .
and i have lead you forty year in the wilderness : you clothes be not waxen old upon you , and thy shoe be not waxen old upon thy foot .
ye have not eat bread , neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink : that ye might know that i be the lord you god .
and when ye come unto this place , sihon the king of heshbon , and og the king of bashan , come out against we unto battle , and we smite they :
and we take they land , and give it for a inheritance unto the reubenites , and to the gadites , and to the half tribe of manasseh .
keep therefore the word of this covenant , and do they , that ye may prosper in all that ye do .
ye stand this day all of you before the lord you god ; you captain of you tribe , you elder , and you officer , with all the man of israel ,
you little one , you wife , and thy stranger that be in thy camp , from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water :
that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the lord thy god , and into he oath , which the lord thy god maketh with thee this day :
that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself , and that he may be unto thee a god , as he have say unto thee , and as he have swear unto thy father , to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob .
neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath ;
but with he that standeth here with we this day before the lord we god , and also with he that be not here with we this day :
( for ye know how we have dwell in the land of egypt ; and how we come through the nation which ye pass by ;
and ye have see they abomination , and they idol , wood and stone , silver and gold , which be among they : )
lest there should be among you man , or woman , or family , or tribe , whose heart turneth away this day from the lord we god , to go and serve the god of these nation ; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood ;
and it come to pass , when he heareth the word of this curse , that he bless himself in he heart , say , i shall have peace , though i walk in the imagination of mine heart , to add drunkenness to thirst :
the lord will not spare he , but then the anger of the lord and he jealousy shall smoke against that man , and all the curse that be write in this book shall lie upon he , and the lord shall blot out he name from under heaven .
and the lord shall separate he unto evil out of all the tribe of israel , accord to all the curse of the covenant that be write in this book of the law :
so that the generation to come of you child that shall rise up after you , and the stranger that shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plague of that land , and the sickness which the lord have lay upon it ;
and that the whole land thereof be brimstone , and salt , and burning , that it be not sow , nor beareth , nor any grass groweth therein , like the overthrow of sodom , and gomorrah , admah , and zeboim , which the lord overthrow in he anger , and in he wrath :
even all nation shall say , wherefore have the lord do thus unto this land ? what meaneth the heat of this great anger ?
then man shall say , because they have forsake the covenant of the lord god of they father , which he make with they when he bring they forth out of the land of egypt :
for they go and serve other god , and worship they , god whom they know not , and whom he have not give unto they :
and the anger of the lord be kindle against this land , to bring upon it all the curse that be write in this book :
and the lord root they out of they land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast they into another land , as it be this day .
the secret thing belong unto the lord we god : but those thing which be reveal belong unto we and to we child for ever , that we may do all the word of this law .
and it shall come to pass , when all these thing be come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which i have set before thee , and thou shalt call they to mind among all the nation , whither the lord thy god have drive thee ,
and shalt return unto the lord thy god , and shalt obey he voice accord to all that i command thee this day , thou and thy child , with all thine heart , and with all thy soul ;
that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity , and have compassion upon thee , and will return and gather thee from all the nation , whither the lord thy god have scatter thee .
if any of thine be drive out unto the outmost part of heaven , from thence will the lord thy god gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land which thy father possess , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above thy father .
and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of thy seed , to love the lord thy god with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , that thou mayest live .
and the lord thy god will put all these curse upon thine enemy , and on they that hate thee , which persecute thee .
and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord , and do all he commandment which i command thee this day .
and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy land , for good : for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good , as he rejoice over thy father :
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god , to keep he commandment and he statute which be write in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
for this commandment which i command thee this day , it be not hide from thee , neither be it far off .
it be not in heaven , that thou shouldest say , who shall go up for we to heaven , and bring it unto we , that we may hear it , and do it ?
neither be it beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , who shall go over the sea for we , and bring it unto we , that we may hear it , and do it ?
but the word be very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou mayest do it .
see , i have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ;
in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy god , to walk in he way , and to keep he commandment and he statute and he judgment , that thou mayest live and multiply : and the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
but if thine heart turn away , so that thou wilt not hear , but shalt be draw away , and worship other god , and serve they ;
i denounce unto you this day , that ye shall surely perish , and that ye shall not prolong you day upon the land , whither thou passest over jordan to go to possess it .
i call heaven and earth to record this day against you , that i have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing : therefore choose life , that both thou and thy seed may live :
that thou mayest love the lord thy god , and that thou mayest obey he voice , and that thou mayest cleave unto he : for he be thy life , and the length of thy day : that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord sware unto thy father , to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob , to give they .
and moses go and speak these word unto all israel .
and he say unto they , i be a hundred and twenty year old this day ; i can no more go out and come in : also the lord have say unto i , thou shalt not go over this jordan .
the lord thy god , he will go over before thee , and he will destroy these nation from before thee , and thou shalt possess they : and joshua , he shall go over before thee , as the lord have say .
and the lord shall do unto they as he do to sihon and to og , king of the amorites , and unto the land of they , whom he destroy .
and the lord shall give they up before you face , that ye may do unto they accord unto all the commandment which i have command you .
be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of they : for the lord thy god , he it be that doth go with thee ; he will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
and moses call unto joshua , and say unto he in the sight of all israel , be strong and of a good courage : for thou must go with this people unto the land which the lord have swear unto they father to give they ; and thou shalt cause they to inherit it .
and the lord , he it be that doth go before thee ; he will be with thee , he will not fail thee , neither forsake thee : fear not , neither be dismay .
and moses write this law , and deliver it unto the priest the son of levi , which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord , and unto all the elder of israel .
and moses command they , say , at the end of every seven year , in the solemnity of the year of release , in the feast of tabernacle ,
when all israel be come to appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all israel in they hearing .
gather the people together , man , and woman , and child , and thy stranger that be within thy gate , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the lord you god , and observe to do all the word of this law :
and that they child , which have not know any thing , may hear , and learn to fear the lord you god , as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it .
and the lord say unto mose , behold , thy day approach that thou must die : call joshua , and present yourselve in the tabernacle of the congregation , that i may give he a charge .
and moses and joshua go , and present themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation .
and the lord appear in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud : and the pillar of the cloud stand over the door of the tabernacle .
and the lord say unto mose , behold , thou shalt sleep with thy father ; and this people will rise up , and go a whoring after the god of the stranger of the land , whither they go to be among they , and will forsake i , and break my covenant which i have make with they .
then my anger shall be kindle against they in that day , and i will forsake they , and i will hide my face from they , and they shall be devour , and many evil and trouble shall befall they ; so that they will say in that day , be not these evil come upon we , because we god be not among we ?
and i will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have work , in that they be turn unto other god .
now therefore write ye this song for you , and teach it the child of israel : put it in they mouth , that this song may be a witness for i against the child of israel .
for when i shall have bring they into the land which i sware unto they father , that floweth with milk and honey ; and they shall have eat and fill themselves , and waxen fat ; then will they turn unto other god , and serve they , and provoke i , and break my covenant .
and it shall come to pass , when many evil and trouble be befall they , that this song shall testify against they as a witness ; for it shall not be forget out of the mouth of they seed : for i know they imagination which they go about , even now , before i have bring they into the land which i sware .
moses therefore write this song the same day , and teach it the child of israel .
and he give joshua the son of nun a charge , and say , be strong and of a good courage : for thou shalt bring the child of israel into the land which i sware unto they : and i will be with thee .
and it come to pass , when moses have make a end of write the word of this law in a book , until they be finish ,
that mose command the levites , which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord , say ,
take this book of the law , and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the lord you god , that it may be there for a witness against thee .
for i know thy rebellion , and thy stiff neck : behold , while i be yet alive with you this day , ye have be rebellious against the lord ; and how much more after my death ?
gather unto i all the elder of you tribe , and you officer , that i may speak these word in they ear , and call heaven and earth to record against they .
for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselve , and turn aside from the way which i have command you ; and evil will befall you in the latter day ; because ye will do evil in the sight of the lord , to provoke he to anger through the work of you hand .
and moses spake in the ear of all the congregation of israel the word of this song , until they be end .
give ear , o ye heaven , and i will speak ; and hear , o earth , the word of my mouth .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distil as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the shower upon the grass :
because i will publish the name of the lord : ascribe ye greatness unto we god .
he be the rock , he work be perfect : for all he way be judgment : a god of truth and without iniquity , just and right be he .
they have corrupt themselves , they spot be not the spot of he child : they be a perverse and crooked generation .
do ye thus requite the lord , o foolish people and unwise ? be not he thy father that have buy thee ? have he not make thee , and established thee ?
remember the day of old , consider the year of many generation : ask thy father , and he will shew thee ; thy elder , and they will tell thee .
when the most high divide to the nation they inheritance , when he separate the son of adam , he set the bound of the people accord to the number of the child of israel .
for the lord 's portion be he people ; jacob be the lot of he inheritance .
he find he in a desert land , and in the waste howling wilderness ; he lead he about , he instruct he , he keep he as the apple of he eye .
as a eagle stirreth up she nest , fluttereth over she young , spreadeth abroad she wing , taketh they , beareth they on she wing :
so the lord alone do lead he , and there be no strange god with he .
he make he ride on the high place of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the field ; and he make he to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock ;
butter of kine , and milk of sheep , with fat of lamb , and ram of the breed of bashan , and goat , with the fat of kidney of wheat ; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape .
but jeshurun wax fat , and kick : thou art waxen fat , thou art grow thick , thou art cover with fatness ; then he forsake god which make he , and lightly esteem the rock of he salvation .
they provoke he to jealousy with strange god , with abomination provoke they he to anger .
they sacrifice unto devil , not to god ; to god whom they know not , to new god that come newly up , whom you father fear not .
of the rock that beget thee thou art unmindful , and hast forget god that form thee .
and when the lord see it , he abhor they , because of the provoke of he son , and of he daughter .
and he say , i will hide my face from they , i will see what they end shall be : for they be a very froward generation , child in whom be no faith .
they have move i to jealousy with that which be not god ; they have provoke i to anger with they vanity : and i will move they to jealousy with those which be not a people ; i will provoke they to anger with a foolish nation .
for a fire be kindle in mine anger , and shall burn unto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with she increase , and set on fire the foundation of the mountain .
i will heap mischief upon they ; i will spend mine arrow upon they .
they shall be burn with hunger , and devour with burn heat , and with bitter destruction : i will also send the tooth of beast upon they , with the poison of serpent of the dust .
the sword without , and terror within , shall destroy both the young man and the virgin , the suckling also with the man of gray hair .
i say , i would scatter they into corner , i would make the remembrance of they to cease from among man :
be it not that i fear the wrath of the enemy , lest they adversary should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , we hand be high , and the lord have not do all this .
for they be a nation void of counsel , neither be there any understanding in they .
o that they be wise , that they understand this , that they would consider they latter end !
how should one chase a thousand , and two put ten thousand to flight , except they rock have sell they , and the lord have shut they up ?
for they rock be not as we rock , even we enemy themselves be judge .
for they vine be of the vine of sodom , and of the field of gomorrah : they grape be grape of gall , they cluster be bitter :
they wine be the poison of dragon , and the cruel venom of asp .
be not this lay up in store with i , and seal up among my treasure ?
to i belongeth vengeance , and recompence ; they foot shall slide in due time : for the day of they calamity be at hand , and the thing that shall come upon they make haste .
for the lord shall judge he people , and repent himself for he servant , when he seeth that they power be go , and there be none shut up , or leave .
and he shall say , where be they god , they rock in whom they trust ,
which do eat the fat of they sacrifice , and drink the wine of they drink offering ? let they rise up and help you , and be you protection .
see now that i , even i , be he , and there be no god with i : i kill , and i make alive ; i wind , and i heal : neither be there any that can deliver out of my hand .
for i lift up my hand to heaven , and say , i live for ever .
if i whet my glittering sword , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; i will render vengeance to mine enemy , and will reward they that hate i .
i will make mine arrow drunk with blood , and my sword shall devour flesh ; and that with the blood of the slay and of the captive , from the beginning of revenge upon the enemy .
rejoice , o ye nation , with he people : for he will avenge the blood of he servant , and will render vengeance to he adversary , and will be merciful unto he land , and to he people .
and moses come and speak all the word of this song in the ear of the people , he , and hoshea the son of nun .
and moses make a end of speak all these word to all israel :
and he say unto they , set you heart unto all the word which i testify among you this day , which ye shall command you child to observe to do , all the word of this law .
for it be not a vain thing for you ; because it be you life : and through this thing ye shall prolong you day in the land , whither ye go over jordan to possess it .
and the lord speak unto mose that selfsame day , say ,
get thee up into this mountain abarim , unto mount nebo , which be in the land of moab , that be over against jericho ; and behold the land of canaan , which i give unto the child of israel for a possession :
and die in the mount whither thou goest up , and be gather unto thy people ; as aaron thy brother die in mount hor , and be gather unto he people :
because ye trespass against i among the child of israel at the water of meribahkadesh , in the wilderness of zin ; because ye sanctify i not in the midst of the child of israel .
yet thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which i give the child of israel .
and this be the blessing , wherewith mose the man of god bless the child of israel before he death .
and he say , the lord come from sinai , and rise up from seir unto they ; he shine forth from mount paran , and he come with ten thousand of saint : from he right hand go a fiery law for they .
yea , he love the people ; all he saint be in thy hand : and they sit down at thy foot ; every one shall receive of thy word .
moses command we a law , even the inheritance of the congregation of jacob .
and he be king in jeshurun , when the head of the people and the tribe of israel be gather together .
let reuben live , and not die ; and let not he man be few .
and this be the blessing of judah : and he say , hear , lord , the voice of judah , and bring he unto he people : let he hand be sufficient for he ; and be thou a help to he from he enemy .
and of levi he say , let thy thummim and thy urim be with thy holy one , whom thou didst prove at massah , and with whom thou didst strive at the water of meribah ;
who say unto he father and to he mother , i have not see he ; neither do he acknowledge he brethren , nor know he own child : for they have observe thy word , and keep thy covenant .
they shall teach jacob thy judgment , and israel thy law : they shall put incense before thee , and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar .
bless , lord , he substance , and accept the work of he hand : smite through the loin of they that rise against he , and of they that hate he , that they rise not again .
and of benjamin he say , the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by he ; and the lord shall cover he all the day long , and he shall dwell between he shoulder .
and of joseph he say , bless of the lord be he land , for the precious thing of heaven , for the dew , and for the deep that coucheth beneath ,
and for the precious fruit bring forth by the sun , and for the precious thing put forth by the moon ,
and for the chief thing of the ancient mountain , and for the precious thing of the lasting hill ,
and for the precious thing of the earth and fulness thereof , and for the good will of he that dwelt in the bush : let the blessing come upon the head of joseph , and upon the top of the head of he that be separate from he brethren .
he glory be like the firstling of he bullock , and he horn be like the horn of unicorn : with they he shall push the people together to the end of the earth : and they be the ten thousand of ephraim , and they be the thousand of manasseh .
and of zebulun he say , rejoice , zebulun , in thy go out ; and , issachar , in thy tent .
they shall call the people unto the mountain ; there they shall offer sacrifice of righteousness : for they shall suck of the abundance of the sea , and of treasure hide in the sand .
and of gad he say , blessed be he that enlargeth gad : he dwelleth as a lion , and teareth the arm with the crown of the head .
and he provide the first part for himself , because there , in a portion of the lawgiver , be he seat ; and he come with the head of the people , he execute the justice of the lord , and he judgment with israel .
and of dan he say , dan be a lion 's whelp : he shall leap from bashan .
and of naphtali he say , o naphtali , satisfy with favour , and full with the blessing of the lord : possess thou the west and the south .
and of asher he say , let asher be bless with child ; let he be acceptable to he brethren , and let he dip he foot in oil .
thy shoe shall be iron and brass ; and as thy day , so shall thy strength be .
there be none like unto the god of jeshurun , who rideth upon the heaven in thy help , and in he excellency on the sky .
the eternal god be thy refuge , and underneath be the everlasting arm : and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee ; and shall say , destroy they .
israel then shall dwell in safety alone : the fountain of jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine ; also he heaven shall drop down dew .
happy art thou , o israel : who be like unto thee , o people save by the lord , the shield of thy help , and who be the sword of thy excellency ! and thine enemy shall be find liar unto thee ; and thou shalt tread upon they high place .
and moses go up from the plain of moab unto the mountain of nebo , to the top of pisgah , that be over against jericho .
and the lord shew he all the land of gilead , unto dan ,
and all naphtali , and the land of ephraim , and manasseh , and all the land of judah , unto the utmost sea ,
and the south , and the plain of the valley of jericho , the city of palm tree , unto zoar .
and the lord say unto he , this be the land which i sware unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob , say , i will give it unto thy seed : i have cause thee to see it with thine eye , but thou shalt not go over thither .
so mose the servant of the lord die there in the land of moab , accord to the word of the lord .
and he bury he in a valley in the land of moab , over against bethpeor : but no man knoweth of he sepulchre unto this day .
and moses be a hundred and twenty year old when he die : he eye be not dim , nor he natural force abate .
and the child of israel weep for moses in the plain of moab thirty day : so the day of weep and mourn for mose be end .
and joshua the son of nun be full of the spirit of wisdom ; for moses have lay he hand upon he : and the child of israel hearken unto he , and do as the lord command moses .
and there arise not a prophet since in israel like unto moses , whom the lord know face to face ,
in all the sign and the wonder , which the lord send he to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh , and to all he servant , and to all he land ,
and in all that mighty hand , and in all the great terror which mose shew in the sight of all israel .
now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it come to pass , that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun , moses ' minister , say ,
moses my servant be dead ; now therefore arise , go over this jordan , thou , and all this people , unto the land which i do give to they , even to the child of israel .
every place that the sole of you foot shall tread upon , that have i give unto you , as i say unto mose .
from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river , the river euphrates , all the land of the hittites , and unto the great sea toward the go down of the sun , shall be you coast .
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the day of thy life : as i be with mose , so i will be with thee : i will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
be strong and of a good courage : for unto this people shalt thou divide for a inheritance the land , which i sware unto they father to give they .
only be thou strong and very courageous , that thou mayest observe to do accord to all the law , which mose my servant command thee : turn not from it to the right hand or to the leave , that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest .
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest observe to do accord to all that be write therein : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
have not i command thee ?
be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed : for the lord thy god be with thee whithersoever thou goest .
then joshua command the officer of the people , say ,
pass through the host , and command the people , say , prepare you victuals ; for within three day ye shall pass over this jordan , to go in to possess the land , which the lord you god giveth you to possess it .
and to the reubenites , and to the gadites , and to half the tribe of manasseh , spake joshua , say ,
remember the word which mose the servant of the lord command you , say , the lord you god have give you rest , and have give you this land .
you wife , you little one , and you cattle , shall remain in the land which moses give you on this side jordan ; but ye shall pass before you brethren arm , all the mighty man of valour , and help they ;
until the lord have give you brethren rest , as he have give you , and they also have possess the land which the lord you god giveth they : then ye shall return unto the land of you possession , and enjoy it , which mose the lord 's servant give you on this side jordan toward the sunrising .
and they answer joshua , say , all that thou commandest we we will do , and whithersoever thou sendest we , we will go .
accord as we hearken unto mose in all thing , so will we hearken unto thee : only the lord thy god be with thee , as he be with mose .
whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment , and will not hearken unto thy word in all that thou commandest he , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
and joshua the son of nun send out of shittim two man to spy secretly , say , go view the land , even jericho .
and they go , and come into a harlot 's house , name rahab , and lodge there .
and it be tell the king of jericho , say , behold , there come man in hither to night of the child of israel to search out the country .
and the king of jericho send unto rahab , say , bring forth the man that be come to thee , which be enter into thine house : for they be come to search out all the country .
and the woman take the two man , and hide they , and say thus , there come man unto i , but i wist not whence they be :
and it come to pass about the time of shut of the gate , when it be dark , that the man go out : whither the man go i wot not : pursue after they quickly ; for ye shall overtake they .
but she have bring they up to the roof of the house , and hide they with the stalk of flax , which she have lay in order upon the roof .
and the man pursue after they the way to jordan unto the ford : and as soon as they which pursue after they be go out , they shut the gate .
and before they be lay down , she come up unto they upon the roof ;
and she say unto the man , i know that the lord have give you the land , and that you terror be fall upon we , and that all the inhabitant of the land faint because of you .
for we have hear how the lord dry up the water of the red sea for you , when ye come out of egypt ; and what ye do unto the two king of the amorites , that be on the other side jordan , sihon and og , whom ye utterly destroy .
and as soon as we have hear these thing , we heart do melt , neither do there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the lord you god , he be god in heaven above , and in earth beneath .
now therefore , i pray you , swear unto i by the lord , since i have shew you kindness , that ye will also shew kindness unto my father 's house , and give i a true token :
and that ye will save alive my father , and my mother , and my brethren , and my sister , and all that they have , and deliver we life from death .
and the man answer she , we life for yours , if ye utter not this we business .
and it shall be , when the lord have give we the land , that we will deal kindly and truly with thee .
then she let they down by a cord through the window : for she house be upon the town wall , and she dwell upon the wall .
and she say unto they , get you to the mountain , lest the pursuer meet you ; and hide yourselve there three day , until the pursuer be return : and afterward may ye go you way .
and the man say unto she , we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast make we swear .
behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let we down by : and thou shalt bring thy father , and thy mother , and thy brethren , and all thy father 's household , home unto thee .
and it shall be , that whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house into the street , he blood shall be upon he head , and we will be guiltless : and whosoever shall be with thee in the house , he blood shall be on we head , if any hand be upon he .
and if thou utter this we business , then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast make we to swear .
and she say , accord unto you word , so be it .
and she send they away , and they depart : and she bind the scarlet line in the window .
and they go , and come unto the mountain , and abode there three day , until the pursuer be return : and the pursuer seek they throughout all the way , but find they not .
so the two man return , and descend from the mountain , and pass over , and come to joshua the son of nun , and tell he all thing that befall they :
and they say unto joshua , truly the lord have deliver into we hand all the land ; for even all the inhabitant of the country do faint because of we .
and joshua rise early in the morning ; and they remove from shittim , and come to jordan , he and all the child of israel , and lodge there before they pass over .
and it come to pass after three day , that the officer go through the host ;
and they command the people , say , when ye see the ark of the covenant of the lord you god , and the priest the levites bear it , then ye shall remove from you place , and go after it .
yet there shall be a space between you and it , about two thousand cubit by measure : come not near unto it , that ye may know the way by which ye must go : for ye have not pass this way heretofore .
and joshua say unto the people , sanctify yourselve : for to morrow the lord will do wonder among you .
and joshua spake unto the priest , say , take up the ark of the covenant , and pass over before the people .
and they take up the ark of the covenant , and go before the people .
and the lord say unto joshua , this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel , that they may know that , as i be with mose , so i will be with thee .
and thou shalt command the priest that bear the ark of the covenant , say , when ye be come to the brink of the water of jordan , ye shall stand still in jordan .
and joshua say unto the child of israel , come hither , and hear the word of the lord you god .
and joshua say , hereby ye shall know that the living god be among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites , and the hittites , and the hivites , and the perizzites , and the girgashites , and the amorites , and the jebusites .
behold , the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into jordan .
now therefore take you twelve man out of the tribe of israel , out of every tribe a man .
and it shall come to pass , as soon as the sole of the foot of the priest that bear the ark of the lord , the lord of all the earth , shall rest in the water of jordan , that the water of jordan shall be cut off from the water that come down from above ; and they shall stand upon a heap .
and it come to pass , when the people remove from they tent , to pass over jordan , and the priest bear the ark of the covenant before the people ;
and as they that bare the ark be come unto jordan , and the foot of the priest that bare the ark be dip in the brim of the water , ( for jordan overfloweth all he bank all the time of harvest , )
that the water which come down from above stand and rise up upon a heap very far from the city adam , that be beside zaretan : and those that come down toward the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , fail , and be cut off : and the people pass over right against jericho .
and the priest that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord stand firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan , and all the israelites pass over on dry ground , until all the people be pass clean over jordan .
and it come to pass , when all the people be clean pass over jordan , that the lord spake unto joshua , say ,
take you twelve man out of the people , out of every tribe a man ,
and command ye they , say , take you hence out of the midst of jordan , out of the place where the priest ' foot stand firm , twelve stone , and ye shall carry they over with you , and leave they in the lodging place , where ye shall lodge this night .
then joshua call the twelve man , whom he have prepare of the child of israel , out of every tribe a man :
and joshua say unto they , pass over before the ark of the lord you god into the midst of jordan , and take you up every man of you a stone upon he shoulder , accord unto the number of the tribe of the child of israel :
that this may be a sign among you , that when you child ask they father in time to come , say , what mean ye by these stone ?
then ye shall answer they , that the water of jordan be cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord ; when it pass over jordan , the water of jordan be cut off : and these stone shall be for a memorial unto the child of israel for ever .
and the child of israel do so as joshua command , and take up twelve stone out of the midst of jordan , as the lord spake unto joshua , accord to the number of the tribe of the child of israel , and carry they over with they unto the place where they lodge , and lay they down there .
and joshua set up twelve stone in the midst of jordan , in the place where the foot of the priest which bare the ark of the covenant stand : and they be there unto this day .
for the priest which bare the ark stand in the midst of jordan , until everything be finish that the lord command joshua to speak unto the people , accord to all that moses command joshua : and the people hast and pass over .
and it come to pass , when all the people be clean pass over , that the ark of the lord pass over , and the priest , in the presence of the people .
and the child of reuben , and the child of gad , and half the tribe of manasseh , pass over arm before the child of israel , as moses spake unto they :
about forty thousand prepare for war pass over before the lord unto battle , to the plain of jericho .
on that day the lord magnify joshua in the sight of all israel ; and they fear he , as they fear moses , all the day of he life .
and the lord spake unto joshua , say ,
command the priest that bear the ark of the testimony , that they come up out of jordan .
joshua therefore command the priest , say , come ye up out of jordan .
and it come to pass , when the priest that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord be come up out of the midst of jordan , and the sole of the priest ' foot be lift up unto the dry land , that the water of jordan return unto they place , and flow over all he bank , as they do before .
and the people come up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamp in gilgal , in the east border of jericho .
and those twelve stone , which they take out of jordan , do joshua pitch in gilgal .
and he speak unto the child of israel , say , when you child shall ask they father in time to come , say , what mean these stone ?
then ye shall let you child know , say , israel come over this jordan on dry land .
for the lord you god dry up the water of jordan from before you , until ye be pass over , as the lord you god do to the red sea , which he dry up from before we , until we be go over :
that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord , that it be mighty : that ye might fear the lord you god for ever .
and it come to pass , when all the king of the amorites , which be on the side of jordan westward , and all the king of the canaanites , which be by the sea , hear that the lord have dry up the water of jordan from before the child of israel , until we be pass over , that they heart melt , neither be there spirit in they any more , because of the child of israel .
at that time the lord say unto joshua , make thee sharp knife , and circumcise again the child of israel the second time .
and joshua make he sharp knife , and circumcise the child of israel at the hill of the foreskin .
and this be the cause why joshua do circumcise : all the people that come out of egypt , that be male , even all the man of war , die in the wilderness by the way , after they come out of egypt .
now all the people that come out be circumcise : but all the people that be bear in the wilderness by the way as they come forth out of egypt , they they have not circumcise .
for the child of israel walk forty year in the wilderness , till all the people that be man of war , which come out of egypt , be consume , because they obey not the voice of the lord : unto whom the lord sware that he would not shew they the land , which the lord sware unto they father that he would give we , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
and they child , whom he raise up in they stead , they joshua circumcise : for they be uncircumcised , because they have not circumcise they by the way .
and it come to pass , when they have do circumcise all the people , that they abide in they place in the camp , till they be whole .
and the lord say unto joshua , this day have i roll away the reproach of egypt from off you .
wherefore the name of the place be call gilgal unto this day .
and the child of israel encamped in gilgal , and keep the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plain of jericho .
and they do eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover , unleavened cake , and parched corn in the selfsame day .
and the manna cease on the morrow after they have eat of the old corn of the land ; neither have the child of israel manna any more ; but they do eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year .
and it come to pass , when joshua be by jericho , that he lift up he eye and look , and , behold , there stand a man over against he with he sword draw in he hand : and joshua go unto he , and say unto he , art thou for we , or for we adversary ?
and he say , nay ; but as captain of the host of the lord be i now come .
and joshua fall on he face to the earth , and do worship , and say unto he , what saith my lord unto he servant ?
and the captain of the lord 's host say unto joshua , loose thy shoe from off thy foot ; for the place whereon thou standest be holy .
and joshua do so .
now jericho be straitly shut up because of the child of israel : none go out , and none come in .
and the lord say unto joshua , see , i have give into thine hand jericho , and the king thereof , and the mighty man of valour .
and ye shall compass the city , all ye man of war , and go round about the city once .
thus shalt thou do six day .
and seven priest shall bear before the ark seven trumpet of ram ' horn : and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven time , and the priest shall blow with the trumpet .
and it shall come to pass , that when they make a long blast with the ram 's horn , and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet , all the people shall shout with a great shout ; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat , and the people shall ascend up every man straight before he .
and joshua the son of nun call the priest , and say unto they , take up the ark of the covenant , and let seven priest bear seven trumpet of ram ' horn before the ark of the lord .
and he say unto the people , pass on , and compass the city , and let he that be armed pass on before the ark of the lord .
and it come to pass , when joshua have speak unto the people , that the seven priest bear the seven trumpet of ram ' horn pass on before the lord , and blow with the trumpet : and the ark of the covenant of the lord follow they .
and the armed man go before the priest that blow with the trumpet , and the rereward come after the ark , the priest go on , and blow with the trumpet .
and joshua have command the people , say , ye shall not shout , nor make any noise with you voice , neither shall any word proceed out of you mouth , until the day i bid you shout ; then shall ye shout .
so the ark of the lord compass the city , go about it once : and they come into the camp , and lodge in the camp .
and joshua rise early in the morning , and the priest take up the ark of the lord .
and seven priest bear seven trumpet of ram ' horn before the ark of the lord go on continually , and blow with the trumpet : and the armed man go before they ; but the rereward come after the ark of the lord , the priest go on , and blow with the trumpet .
and the second day they compass the city once , and return into the camp : so they do six day .
and it come to pass on the seventh day , that they rise early about the dawn of the day , and compass the city after the same manner seven time : only on that day they compass the city seven time .
and it come to pass at the seventh time , when the priest blow with the trumpet , joshua say unto the people , shout ; for the lord have give you the city .
and the city shall be accurse , even it , and all that be therein , to the lord : only rahab the harlot shall live , she and all that be with she in the house , because she hide the messenger that we send .
and ye , in any wise keep yourselve from the accursed thing , lest ye make yourselve accursed , when ye take of the accursed thing , and make the camp of israel a curse , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessel of brass and iron , be consecrate unto the lord : they shall come into the treasury of the lord .
so the people shout when the priest blow with the trumpet : and it come to pass , when the people hear the sound of the trumpet , and the people shout with a great shout , that the wall fall down flat , so that the people go up into the city , every man straight before he , and they take the city .
and they utterly destroy all that be in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and ox , and sheep , and ass , with the edge of the sword .
but joshua have say unto the two man that have spy out the country , go into the harlot 's house , and bring out thence the woman , and all that she have , as ye sware unto she .
and the young man that be spy go in , and bring out rahab , and she father , and she mother , and she brethren , and all that she have ; and they bring out all she kindred , and leave they without the camp of israel .
and they burn the city with fire , and all that be therein : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessel of brass and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the lord .
and joshua save rahab the harlot alive , and she father 's household , and all that she have ; and she dwelleth in israel even unto this day ; because she hide the messenger , which joshua send to spy out jericho .
and joshua adjure they at that time , say , cursed be the man before the lord , that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho : he shall lay the foundation thereof in he firstborn , and in he youngest son shall he set up the gate of it .
so the lord be with joshua ; and he fame be noised throughout all the country .
but the child of israel commit a trespass in the accursed thing : for achan , the son of carmi , the son of zabdi , the son of zerah , of the tribe of judah , take of the accursed thing : and the anger of the lord be kindle against the child of israel .
and joshua send man from jericho to ai , which be beside bethaven , on the east side of bethel , and spake unto they , say , go up and view the country .
and the man go up and view ai .
and they return to joshua , and say unto he , let not all the people go up ; but let about two or three thousand man go up and smite aus ; and make not all the people to labour thither ; for they be but few .
so there go up thither of the people about three thousand man : and they flee before the man of ai .
and the man of aus smote of they about thirty and six man : for they chase they from before the gate even unto shebarim , and smite they in the go down : wherefore the heart of the people melt , and become as water .
and joshua rent he clothes , and fall to the earth upon he face before the ark of the lord until the eventide , he and the elder of israel , and put dust upon they head .
and joshua say , alas , o lord god , wherefore hast thou at all bring this people over jordan , to deliver we into the hand of the amorites , to destroy we ? would to god we have be content , and dwelt on the other side jordan !
o lord , what shall i say , when israel turneth they back before they enemy !
for the canaanites and all the inhabitant of the land shall hear of it , and shall environ we round , and cut off we name from the earth : and what wilt thou do unto thy great name ?
and the lord say unto joshua , get thee up ; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face ?
israel have sin , and they have also transgress my covenant which i command they : for they have even take of the accursed thing , and have also steal , and dissemble also , and they have put it even among they own stuff .
therefore the child of israel could not stand before they enemy , but turn they back before they enemy , because they be accurse : neither will i be with you any more , except ye destroy the accurse from among you .
up , sanctify the people , and say , sanctify yourselve against to morrow : for thus saith the lord god of israel , there be a accursed thing in the midst of thee , o israel : thou canst not stand before thine enemy , until ye take away the accursed thing from among you .
in the morning therefore ye shall be bring accord to you tribe : and it shall be , that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come accord to the family thereof ; and the family which the lord shall take shall come by household ; and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man .
and it shall be , that he that be take with the accursed thing shall be burn with fire , he and all that he have : because he have transgress the covenant of the lord , and because he have work folly in israel .
so joshua rise up early in the morning , and bring israel by they tribe ; and the tribe of judah be take :
and he bring the family of judah ; and he take the family of the zarhites : and he bring the family of the zarhites man by man ; and zabdi be take :
and he bring he household man by man ; and achan , the son of carmi , the son of zabdi , the son of zerah , of the tribe of judah , be take .
and joshua say unto achan , my son , give , i pray thee , glory to the lord god of israel , and make confession unto he ; and tell i now what thou hast do ; hide it not from i .
and achan answer joshua , and say , indeed i have sin against the lord god of israel , and thus and thus have i do :
when i see among the spoil a goodly babylonish garment , and two hundred shekel of silver , and a wedge of gold of fifty shekel weight , then i covet they , and take they ; and , behold , they be hide in the earth in the midst of my tent , and the silver under it .
so joshua send messenger , and they run unto the tent ; and , behold , it be hide in he tent , and the silver under it .
and they take they out of the midst of the tent , and bring they unto joshua , and unto all the child of israel , and lay they out before the lord .
and joshua , and all israel with he , take achan the son of zerah , and the silver , and the garment , and the wedge of gold , and he son , and he daughter , and he ox , and he ass , and he sheep , and he tent , and all that he have : and they bring they unto the valley of achor .
and joshua say , why hast thou trouble we ? the lord shall trouble thee this day .
and all israel stone he with stone , and burn they with fire , after they have stone they with stone .
and they raise over he a great heap of stone unto this day .
so the lord turn from the fierceness of he anger .
wherefore the name of that place be call , the valley of achor , unto this day .
and the lord say unto joshua , fear not , neither be thou dismayed : take all the people of war with thee , and arise , go up to ai : see , i have give into thy hand the king of ai , and he people , and he city , and he land :
and thou shalt do to ai and she king as thou didst unto jericho and she king : only the spoil thereof , and the cattle thereof , shall ye take for a prey unto yourselve : lay thee a ambush for the city behind it .
so joshua arise , and all the people of war , to go up against ai : and joshua choose out thirty thousand mighty man of valour , and send they away by night .
and he command they , say , behold , ye shall lie in wait against the city , even behind the city : go not very far from the city , but be ye all ready :
and i , and all the people that be with i , will approach unto the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against we , as at the first , that we will flee before they ,
( for they will come out after we ) till we have draw they from the city ; for they will say , they flee before we , as at the first : therefore we will flee before they .
then ye shall rise up from the ambush , and seize upon the city : for the lord you god will deliver it into you hand .
and it shall be , when ye have take the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : accord to the commandment of the lord shall ye do .
see , i have command you .
joshua therefore send they forth : and they go to lie in ambush , and abode between bethel and ai , on the west side of ai : but joshua lodge that night among the people .
and joshua rise up early in the morning , and number the people , and go up , he and the elder of israel , before the people to ai .
and all the people , even the people of war that be with he , go up , and draw nigh , and come before the city , and pitch on the north side of ai : now there be a valley between they and ai .
and he take about five thousand man , and set they to lie in ambush between bethel and ai , on the west side of the city .
and when they have set the people , even all the host that be on the north of the city , and they lier in wait on the west of the city , joshua go that night into the midst of the valley .
and it come to pass , when the king of ai see it , that they hast and rise up early , and the man of the city go out against israel to battle , he and all he people , at a time appoint , before the plain ; but he wist not that there be lier in ambush against he behind the city .
and joshua and all israel make as if they be beat before they , and flee by the way of the wilderness .
and all the people that be in ai be call together to pursue after they : and they pursue after joshua , and be draw away from the city .
and there be not a man leave in ai or bethel , that go not out after israel : and they leave the city open , and pursue after israel .
and the lord say unto joshua , stretch out the spear that be in thy hand toward ai ; for i will give it into thine hand .
and joshua stretch out the spear that he have in he hand toward the city .
and the ambush arise quickly out of they place , and they run as soon as he have stretch out he hand : and they enter into the city , and take it , and hast and set the city on fire .
and when the man of aus look behind they , they see , and , behold , the smoke of the city ascend up to heaven , and they have no power to flee this way or that way : and the people that flee to the wilderness turn back upon the pursuer .
and when joshua and all israel see that the ambush have take the city , and that the smoke of the city ascend , then they turn again , and slew the man of ai .
and the other issue out of the city against they ; so they be in the midst of israel , some on this side , and some on that side : and they smite they , so that they let none of they remain or escape .
and the king of ai they take alive , and bring he to joshua .
and it come to pass , when israel have make a end of slaying all the inhabitant of ai in the field , in the wilderness wherein they chase they , and when they be all fall on the edge of the sword , until they be consume , that all the israelites return unto ai , and smite it with the edge of the sword .
and so it be , that all that fall that day , both of man and woman , be twelve thousand , even all the man of ai .
for joshua draw not he hand back , wherewith he stretch out the spear , until he have utterly destroy all the inhabitant of ai .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel take for a prey unto themselves , accord unto the word of the lord which he command joshua .
and joshua burnt ai , and make it a heap for ever , even a desolation unto this day .
and the king of ai he hang on a tree until eventide : and as soon as the sun be down , joshua command that they should take he carcase down from the tree , and cast it at the enter of the gate of the city , and raise thereon a great heap of stone , that remaineth unto this day .
then joshua build a altar unto the lord god of israel in mount ebal ,
as moses the servant of the lord command the child of israel , as it be write in the book of the law of moses , a altar of whole stone , over which no man have lift up any iron : and they offer thereon burnt offering unto the lord , and sacrifice peace offering .
and he write there upon the stone a copy of the law of moses , which he write in the presence of the child of israel .
and all israel , and they elder , and officer , and they judge , stand on this side the ark and on that side before the priest the levites , which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord , as well the stranger , as he that be bear among they ; half of they over against mount gerizim , and half of they over against mount ebal ; as moses the servant of the lord have command before , that they should bless the people of israel .
and afterward he read all the word of the law , the blessing and cursing , accord to all that be write in the book of the law .
there be not a word of all that moses command , which joshua read not before all the congregation of israel , with the woman , and the little one , and the stranger that be conversant among they .
and it come to pass , when all the king which be on this side jordan , in the hill , and in the valley , and in all the coast of the great sea over against lebanon , the hittite , and the amorite , the canaanite , the perizzite , the hivite , and the jebusite , hear thereof ;
that they gather themselves together , to fight with joshua and with israel , with one accord .
and when the inhabitant of gibeon hear what joshua have do unto jericho and to ai ,
they do work wilily , and go and make as if they have be ambassador , and take old sack upon they ass , and wine bottle , old , and rent , and bind up ;
and old shoe and clout upon they foot , and old garment upon they ; and all the bread of they provision be dry and mouldy .
and they go to joshua unto the camp at gilgal , and say unto he , and to the man of israel , we be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with we .
and the man of israel say unto the hivites , peradventure ye dwell among we ; and how shall we make a league with you ?
and they say unto joshua , we be thy servant .
and joshua say unto they , who be ye ? and from whence come ye ?
and they say unto he , from a very far country thy servant be come because of the name of the lord thy god : for we have hear the fame of he , and all that he do in egypt ,
and all that he do to the two king of the amorites , that be beyond jordan , to sihon king of heshbon , and to og king of bashan , which be at ashtaroth .
wherefore we elder and all the inhabitant of we country speak to we , say , take victuals with you for the journey , and go to meet they , and say unto they , we be you servant : therefore now make ye a league with we .
this we bread we take hot for we provision out of we house on the day we come forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it be dry , and it be mouldy :
and these bottle of wine , which we fill , be new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these we garment and we shoe be become old by reason of the very long journey .
and the man take of they victuals , and ask not counsel at the mouth of the lord .
and joshua make peace with they , and make a league with they , to let they live : and the prince of the congregation sware unto they .
and it come to pass at the end of three day after they have make a league with they , that they hear that they be they neighbour , and that they dwell among they .
and the child of israel journey , and come unto they city on the third day .
now they city be gibeon , and chephirah , and beeroth , and kirjathjearim .
and the child of israel smite they not , because the prince of the congregation have swear unto they by the lord god of israel .
and all the congregation murmur against the prince .
but all the prince say unto all the congregation , we have swear unto they by the lord god of israel : now therefore we may not touch they .
this we will do to they ; we will even let they live , lest wrath be upon we , because of the oath which we sware unto they .
and the prince say unto they , let they live ; but let they be hewer of wood and drawer of water unto all the congregation ; as the prince have promise they .
and joshua call for they , and he speak unto they , say , wherefore have ye beguile we , say , we be very far from you ; when ye dwell among we ?
now therefore ye be curse , and there shall none of you be free from be bondman , and hewer of wood and drawer of water for the house of my god .
and they answer joshua , and say , because it be certainly tell thy servant , how that the lord thy god command he servant mose to give you all the land , and to destroy all the inhabitant of the land from before you , therefore we be sore afraid of we life because of you , and have do this thing .
and now , behold , we be in thine hand : as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto we , do .
and so do he unto they , and deliver they out of the hand of the child of israel , that they slew they not .
and joshua make they that day hewer of wood and drawer of water for the congregation , and for the altar of the lord , even unto this day , in the place which he should choose .
now it come to pass , when adonizedec king of jerusalem have hear how joshua have take ai , and have utterly destroy it ; as he have do to jericho and she king , so he have do to ai and she king ; and how the inhabitant of gibeon have make peace with israel , and be among they ;
that they fear greatly , because gibeon be a great city , as one of the royal city , and because it be greater than ai , and all the man thereof be mighty .
wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem send unto hoham king of hebron , and unto piram king of jarmuth , and unto japhia king of lachish , and unto debir king of eglon , say ,
come up unto i , and help i , that we may smite gibeon : for it have make peace with joshua and with the child of israel .
therefore the five king of the amorites , the king of jerusalem , the king of hebron , the king of jarmuth , the king of lachish , the king of eglon , gather themselves together , and go up , they and all they host , and encamp before gibeon , and make war against it .
and the man of gibeon send unto joshua to the camp to gilgal , say , slack not thy hand from thy servant ; come up to we quickly , and save we , and help we : for all the king of the amorite that dwell in the mountain be gather together against we .
so joshua ascend from gilgal , he , and all the people of war with he , and all the mighty man of valour .
and the lord say unto joshua , fear they not : for i have deliver they into thine hand ; there shall not a man of they stand before thee .
joshua therefore come unto they suddenly , and go up from gilgal all night .
and the lord discomfited they before israel , and slew they with a great slaughter at gibeon , and chase they along the way that goeth up to bethhoron , and smite they to azekah , and unto makkedah .
and it come to pass , as they flee from before israel , and be in the go down to bethhoron , that the lord cast down great stone from heaven upon they unto azekah , and they die : they be more which die with hailstone than they whom the child of israel slew with the sword .
then speak joshua to the lord in the day when the lord deliver up the amorites before the child of israel , and he say in the sight of israel , sun , stand thou still upon gibeon ; and thou , moon , in the valley of ajalon .
and the sun stand still , and the moon stay , until the people have avenge themselves upon they enemy .
be not this write in the book of jasher ?
so the sun stand still in the midst of heaven , and hast not to go down about a whole day .
and there be no day like that before it or after it , that the lord hearken unto the voice of a man : for the lord fight for israel .
and joshua return , and all israel with he , unto the camp to gilgal .
but these five king flee , and hide themselves in a cave at makkedah .
and it be tell joshua , say , the five king be find hide in a cave at makkedah .
and joshua say , roll great stone upon the mouth of the cave , and set man by it for to keep they :
and stay ye not , but pursue after you enemy , and smite the hindmost of they ; suffer they not to enter into they city : for the lord you god have deliver they into you hand .
and it come to pass , when joshua and the child of israel have make a end of slaying they with a very great slaughter , till they be consume , that the rest which remain of they enter into fenced city .
and all the people return to the camp to joshua at makkedah in peace : none move he tongue against any of the child of israel .
then say joshua , open the mouth of the cave , and bring out those five king unto i out of the cave .
and they do so , and bring forth those five king unto he out of the cave , the king of jerusalem , the king of hebron , the king of jarmuth , the king of lachish , and the king of eglon .
and it come to pass , when they bring out those king unto joshua , that joshua call for all the man of israel , and say unto the captain of the man of war which go with he , come near , put you foot upon the neck of these king .
and they come near , and put they foot upon the neck of they .
and joshua say unto they , fear not , nor be dismayed , be strong and of good courage : for thus shall the lord do to all you enemy against whom ye fight .
and afterward joshua smite they , and slew they , and hang they on five tree : and they be hang upon the tree until the evening .
and it come to pass at the time of the go down of the sun , that joshua command , and they take they down off the tree , and cast they into the cave wherein they have be hide , and lay great stone in the cave 's mouth , which remain until this very day .
and that day joshua take makkedah , and smite it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof he utterly destroy , they , and all the soul that be therein ; he let none remain : and he do to the king of makkedah as he do unto the king of jericho .
then joshua pass from makkedah , and all israel with he , unto libnah , and fight against libnah :
and the lord deliver it also , and the king thereof , into the hand of israel ; and he smite it with the edge of the sword , and all the soul that be therein ; he let none remain in it ; but do unto the king thereof as he do unto the king of jericho .
and joshua pass from libnah , and all israel with he , unto lachish , and encamp against it , and fight against it :
and the lord deliver lachish into the hand of israel , which take it on the second day , and smite it with the edge of the sword , and all the soul that be therein , accord to all that he have do to libnah .
then horam king of gezer come up to help lachish ; and joshua smite he and he people , until he have leave he none remain .
and from lachish joshua pass unto eglon , and all israel with he ; and they encamp against it , and fight against it :
and they take it on that day , and smite it with the edge of the sword , and all the soul that be therein he utterly destroy that day , accord to all that he have do to lachish .
and joshua go up from eglon , and all israel with he , unto hebron ; and they fight against it :
and they take it , and smite it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof , and all the city thereof , and all the soul that be therein ; he leave none remain , accord to all that he have do to eglon ; but destroy it utterly , and all the soul that be therein .
and joshua return , and all israel with he , to debir ; and fight against it :
and he take it , and the king thereof , and all the city thereof ; and they smite they with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroy all the soul that be therein ; he leave none remain : as he have do to hebron , so he do to debir , and to the king thereof ; as he have do also to libnah , and to she king .
so joshua smite all the country of the hill , and of the south , and of the vale , and of the spring , and all they king : he leave none remain , but utterly destroy all that breathe , as the lord god of israel command .
and joshua smite they from kadeshbarnea even unto gaza , and all the country of goshen , even unto gibeon .
and all these king and they land do joshua take at one time , because the lord god of israel fight for israel .
and joshua return , and all israel with he , unto the camp to gilgal .
and it come to pass , when jabin king of hazor have hear those thing , that he send to jobab king of madon , and to the king of shimron , and to the king of achshaph ,
and to the king that be on the north of the mountain , and of the plain south of chinneroth , and in the valley , and in the border of dor on the west ,
and to the canaanite on the east and on the west , and to the amorite , and the hittite , and the perizzite , and the jebusite in the mountain , and to the hivite under hermon in the land of mizpeh .
and they go out , they and all they host with they , much people , even as the sand that be upon the sea shore in multitude , with horse and chariot very many .
and when all these king be meet together , they come and pitch together at the water of merom , to fight against israel .
and the lord say unto joshua , be not afraid because of they : for to morrow about this time will i deliver they up all slay before israel : thou shalt hough they horse , and burn they chariot with fire .
so joshua come , and all the people of war with he , against they by the water of merom suddenly ; and they fall upon they .
and the lord deliver they into the hand of israel , who smite they , and chase they unto great zidon , and unto misrephothmaim , and unto the valley of mizpeh eastward ; and they smite they , until they leave they none remain .
and joshua do unto they as the lord bid he : he hough they horse , and burn they chariot with fire .
and joshua at that time turn back , and take hazor , and smite the king thereof with the sword : for hazor beforetime be the head of all those kingdom .
and they smite all the soul that be therein with the edge of the sword , utterly destroy they : there be not any leave to breathe : and he burn hazor with fire .
and all the city of those king , and all the king of they , do joshua take , and smite they with the edge of the sword , and he utterly destroy they , as moses the servant of the lord command .
but as for the city that stand still in they strength , israel burn none of they , save hazor only ; that do joshua burn .
and all the spoil of these city , and the cattle , the child of israel take for a prey unto themselves ; but every man they smite with the edge of the sword , until they have destroy they , neither leave they any to breathe .
as the lord command mose he servant , so do moses command joshua , and so do joshua ; he leave nothing undo of all that the lord command moses .
so joshua take all that land , the hill , and all the south country , and all the land of goshen , and the valley , and the plain , and the mountain of israel , and the valley of the same ;
even from the mount halak , that goeth up to seir , even unto baalgad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon : and all they king he take , and smite they , and slew they .
joshua make war a long time with all those king .
there be not a city that make peace with the child of israel , save the hivites the inhabitant of gibeon : all other they take in battle .
for it be of the lord to harden they heart , that they should come against israel in battle , that he might destroy they utterly , and that they might have no favour , but that he might destroy they , as the lord command moses .
and at that time come joshua , and cut off the anakims from the mountain , from hebron , from debir , from anab , and from all the mountain of judah , and from all the mountain of israel : joshua destroy they utterly with they city .
there be none of the anakims leave in the land of the child of israel : only in gaza , in gath , and in ashdod , there remain .
so joshua take the whole land , accord to all that the lord say unto mose ; and joshua give it for a inheritance unto israel accord to they division by they tribe .
and the land rest from war .
now these be the king of the land , which the child of israel smite , and possess they land on the other side jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river arnon unto mount hermon , and all the plain on the east :
sihon king of the amorites , who dwell in heshbon , and rule from aroer , which be upon the bank of the river arnon , and from the middle of the river , and from half gilead , even unto the river jabbok , which be the border of the child of ammon ;

now joshua be old and stricken in year ; and the lord say unto he , thou art old and stricken in year , and there remaineth yet very much land to be possess .
this be the land that yet remaineth : all the border of the philistines , and all geshuri ,
from sihor , which be before egypt , even unto the border of ekron northward , which be count to the canaanite : five lord of the philistines ; the gazathites , and the ashdothites , the eshkalonites , the gittites , and the ekronites ; also the avites :

all the inhabitant of the hill country from lebanon unto misrephothmaim , and all the sidonians , they will i drive out from before the child of israel : only divide thou it by lot unto the israelites for a inheritance , as i have command thee .
now therefore divide this land for a inheritance unto the nine tribe , and the half tribe of manasseh ,
with whom the reubenites and the gadites have receive they inheritance , which mose give they , beyond jordan eastward , even as moses the servant of the lord give they ;
from aroer , that be upon the bank of the river arnon , and the city that be in the midst of the river , and all the plain of medeba unto dibon ;

and gilead , and the border of the geshurites and maachathites , and all mount hermon , and all bashan unto salcah ;
all the kingdom of og in bashan , which reign in ashtaroth and in edrei , who remain of the remnant of the giant : for these do moses smite , and cast they out .
nevertheless the child of israel expel not the geshurites , nor the maachathites : but the geshurites and the maachathites dwell among the israelites until this day .
only unto the tribe of levi he give none inheritance ; the sacrifice of the lord god of israel make by fire be they inheritance , as he say unto they .
and moses give unto the tribe of the child of reuben inheritance accord to they family .
and they coast be from aroer , that be on the bank of the river arnon , and the city that be in the midst of the river , and all the plain by medeba ;

and the border of the child of reuben be jordan , and the border thereof .

and these be the country which the child of israel inherit in the land of canaan , which eleazar the priest , and joshua the son of nun , and the head of the father of the tribe of the child of israel , distribute for inheritance to they .
by lot be they inheritance , as the lord command by the hand of moses , for the nine tribe , and for the half tribe .
for mose have give the inheritance of two tribe and a half tribe on the other side jordan : but unto the levites he give none inheritance among they .

as the lord command moses , so the child of israel do , and they divide the land .
then the child of judah come unto joshua in gilgal : and caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite say unto he , thou knowest the thing that the lord say unto mose the man of god concern i and thee in kadeshbarnea .
forty year old be i when mose the servant of the lord send i from kadeshbarnea to espy out the land ; and i bring he word again as it be in mine heart .

as yet i be as strong this day as i be in the day that moses send i : as my strength be then , even so be my strength now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
now therefore give i this mountain , whereof the lord spake in that day ; for thou heardest in that day how the anakims be there , and that the city be great and fenced : if so be the lord will be with i , then i shall be able to drive they out , as the lord say .
and joshua bless he , and give unto caleb the son of jephunneh hebron for a inheritance .

be the iniquity of peor too little for we , from which we be not cleanse until this day , although there be a plague in the congregation of the lord ,
but that ye must turn away this day from follow the lord ? and it will be , see ye rebel to day against the lord , that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of israel .
notwithstanding , if the land of you possession be unclean , then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the lord , wherein the lord 's tabernacle dwelleth , and take possession among we : but rebel not against the lord , nor rebel against we , in build you a altar beside the altar of the lord we god .

that we have build we a altar to turn from follow the lord , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offering thereon , let the lord himself require it ;
and if we have not rather do it for fear of this thing , say , in time to come you child might speak unto we child , say , what have ye to do with the lord god of israel ?
for the lord have make jordan a border between we and you , ye child of reuben and child of gad ; ye have no part in the lord : so shall you child make we child cease from fear the lord .

and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest , and the prince , return from the child of reuben , and from the child of gad , out of the land of gilead , unto the land of canaan , to the child of israel , and bring they word again .
and the thing please the child of israel ; and the child of israel bless god , and do not intend to go up against they in battle , to destroy the land wherein the child of reuben and gad dwelt .

behold , i have divide unto you by lot these nation that remain , to be a inheritance for you tribe , from jordan , with all the nation that i have cut off , even unto the great sea westward .
and the lord you god , he shall expel they from before you , and drive they from out of you sight ; and ye shall possess they land , as the lord you god have promise unto you .
be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that be write in the book of the law of moses , that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the leave ;
that ye come not among these nation , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of they god , nor cause to swear by they , neither serve they , nor bow yourselve unto they :
but cleave unto the lord you god , as ye have do unto this day .
for the lord have drive out from before you great nation and strong : but as for you , no man have be able to stand before you unto this day .
one man of you shall chase a thousand : for the lord you god , he it be that fighteth for you , as he have promise you .
take good heed therefore unto yourselve , that ye love the lord you god .
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cleave unto the remnant of these nation , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriage with they , and go in unto they , and they to you :
know for a certainty that the lord you god will no more drive out any of these nation from before you ; but they shall be snare and trap unto you , and scourge in you side , and thorn in you eye , until ye perish from off this good land which the lord you god have give you .
and , behold , this day i be go the way of all the earth : and ye know in all you heart and in all you soul , that not one thing have fail of all the good thing which the lord you god spake concern you ; all be come to pass unto you , and not one thing have fail thereof .
therefore it shall come to pass , that as all good thing be come upon you , which the lord you god promise you ; so shall the lord bring upon you all evil thing , until he have destroy you from off this good land which the lord you god have give you .
when ye have transgress the covenant of the lord you god , which he command you , and have go and serve other god , and bow yourselve to they ; then shall the anger of the lord be kindle against you , and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he have give unto you .
and joshua gather all the tribe of israel to shechem , and call for the elder of israel , and for they head , and for they judge , and for they officer ; and they present themselves before god .
and joshua say unto all the people , thus saith the lord god of israel , you father dwell on the other side of the flood in old time , even terah , the father of abraham , and the father of nachor : and they serve other god .
and i take you father abraham from the other side of the flood , and lead he throughout all the land of canaan , and multiply he seed , and give he isaac .
and i give unto isaac jacob and esau : and i give unto esau mount seir , to possess it ; but jacob and he child go down into egypt .
i send moses also and aaron , and i plague egypt , accord to that which i do among they : and afterward i bring you out .
and i bring you father out of egypt : and ye come unto the sea ; and the egyptians pursue after you father with chariot and horseman unto the red sea .
and when they cry unto the lord , he put darkness between you and the egyptians , and bring the sea upon they , and cover they ; and you eye have see what i have do in egypt : and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season .
and i bring you into the land of the amorites , which dwell on the other side jordan ; and they fight with you : and i give they into you hand , that ye might possess they land ; and i destroy they from before you .
then balak the son of zippor , king of moab , arise and war against israel , and send and call balaam the son of beor to curse you :
but i would not hearken unto balaam ; therefore he bless you still : so i deliver you out of he hand .
and ye go over jordan , and come unto jericho : and the man of jericho fight against you , the amorites , and the perizzites , and the canaanites , and the hittites , and the girgashites , the hivites , and the jebusites ; and i deliver they into you hand .
and i send the hornet before you , which drave they out from before you , even the two king of the amorites ; but not with thy sword , nor with thy bow .
and i have give you a land for which ye do not labour , and city which ye build not , and ye dwell in they ; of the vineyard and oliveyard which ye plant not do ye eat .
now therefore fear the lord , and serve he in sincerity and in truth : and put away the god which you father serve on the other side of the flood , and in egypt ; and serve ye the lord .
and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord , choose you this day whom ye will serve ; whether the god which you father serve that be on the other side of the flood , or the god of the amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but as for i and my house , we will serve the lord .
and the people answer and say , god forbid that we should forsake the lord , to serve other god ;
for the lord we god , he it be that bring we up and we father out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage , and which do those great sign in we sight , and preserve we in all the way wherein we go , and among all the people through whom we pass :
and the lord drave out from before we all the people , even the amorite which dwell in the land : therefore will we also serve the lord ; for he be we god .
and joshua say unto the people , ye can not serve the lord : for he be a holy god ; he be a jealous god ; he will not forgive you transgression nor you sin .
if ye forsake the lord , and serve strange god , then he will turn and do you hurt , and consume you , after that he have do you good .
and the people say unto joshua , nay ; but we will serve the lord .
and joshua say unto the people , ye be witness against yourselve that ye have choose you the lord , to serve he .
and they say , we be witness .
now therefore put away , say he , the strange god which be among you , and incline you heart unto the lord god of israel .
and the people say unto joshua , the lord we god will we serve , and he voice will we obey .
so joshua make a covenant with the people that day , and set they a statute and a ordinance in shechem .
and joshua write these word in the book of the law of god , and take a great stone , and set it up there under a oak , that be by the sanctuary of the lord .
and joshua say unto all the people , behold , this stone shall be a witness unto we ; for it have hear all the word of the lord which he speak unto we : it shall be therefore a witness unto you , lest ye deny you god .
so joshua let the people depart , every man unto he inheritance .
and it come to pass after these thing , that joshua the son of nun , the servant of the lord , die , be a hundred and ten year old .
and they bury he in the border of he inheritance in timnathserah , which be in mount ephraim , on the north side of the hill of gaash .
and israel serve the lord all the day of joshua , and all the day of the elder that overlive joshua , and which have know all the work of the lord , that he have do for israel .
and the bone of joseph , which the child of israel bring up out of egypt , bury they in shechem , in a parcel of ground which jacob buy of the son of hamor the father of shechem for a hundred piece of silver : and it become the inheritance of the child of joseph .
and eleazar the son of aaron die ; and they bury he in a hill that pertain to phinehas he son , which be give he in mount ephraim .
now after the death of joshua it come to pass , that the child of israel ask the lord , say , who shall go up for we against the canaanites first , to fight against they ?
and the lord say , judah shall go up : behold , i have deliver the land into he hand .
and judah say unto simeon he brother , come up with i into my lot , that we may fight against the canaanites ; and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot .
so simeon go with he .
and judah go up ; and the lord deliver the canaanites and the perizzites into they hand : and they slew of they in bezek ten thousand man .
and they find adonibezek in bezek : and they fight against he , and they slew the canaanites and the perizzites .
but adonibezek flee ; and they pursue after he , and catch he , and cut off he thumb and he great toe .
and adonibezek say , threescore and ten king , have they thumb and they great toe cut off , gather they meat under my table : as i have do , so god have requite i .
and they bring he to jerusalem , and there he die .
now the child of judah have fight against jerusalem , and have take it , and smite it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
and afterward the child of judah go down to fight against the canaanites , that dwelt in the mountain , and in the south , and in the valley .
and judah go against the canaanites that dwell in hebron : ( now the name of hebron before be kirjatharba : ) and they slew sheshai , and ahiman , and talmai .
and from thence he go against the inhabitant of debir : and the name of debir before be kirjathsepher :
and caleb say , he that smiteth kirjathsepher , and taketh it , to he will i give achsah my daughter to wife .
and othniel the son of kenaz , caleb 's younger brother , take it : and he give he achsah he daughter to wife .
and it come to pass , when she come to he , that she move he to ask of she father a field : and she light from off she ass ; and caleb say unto she , what wilt thou ?
and she say unto he , give i a blessing : for thou hast give i a south land ; give i also spring of water .
and caleb give she the upper spring and the nether spring .
and the child of the kenite , moses ' father in law , go up out of the city of palm tree with the child of judah into the wilderness of judah , which lieth in the south of arad ; and they go and dwelt among the people .
and judah go with simeon he brother , and they slew the canaanites that inhabit zephath , and utterly destroy it .
and the name of the city be call hormah .
also judah take gaza with the coast thereof , and askelon with the coast thereof , and ekron with the coast thereof .
and the lord be with judah ; and he drave out the inhabitant of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitant of the valley , because they have chariot of iron .
and they give hebron unto caleb , as moses say : and he expel thence the three son of anak .
and the child of benjamin do not drive out the jebusites that inhabit jerusalem ; but the jebusites dwell with the child of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day .
and the house of joseph , they also go up against bethel : and the lord be with they .
and the house of joseph send to descry bethel .
( now the name of the city before be luz . )
and the spy see a man come forth out of the city , and they say unto he , shew we , we pray thee , the entrance into the city , and we will shew thee mercy .
and when he shew they the entrance into the city , they smite the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let go the man and all he family .
and the man go into the land of the hittites , and build a city , and call the name thereof luz : which be the name thereof unto this day .
neither do manasseh drive out the inhabitant of bethshean and she town , nor taanach and she town , nor the inhabitant of dor and she town , nor the inhabitant of ibleam and she town , nor the inhabitant of megiddo and she town : but the canaanites would dwell in that land .
and it come to pass , when israel be strong , that they put the canaanites to tribute , and do not utterly drive they out .
neither do ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwell in gezer ; but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among they .
neither do zebulun drive out the inhabitant of kitron , nor the inhabitant of nahalol ; but the canaanites dwelt among they , and become tributary .
neither do asher drive out the inhabitant of accho , nor the inhabitant of zidon , nor of ahlab , nor of achzib , nor of helbah , nor of aphik , nor of rehob :
but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites , the inhabitant of the land : for they do not drive they out .
neither do naphtali drive out the inhabitant of bethshemesh , nor the inhabitant of bethanath ; but he dwell among the canaanites , the inhabitant of the land : nevertheless the inhabitant of bethshemesh and of bethanath become tributary unto they .
and the amorites force the child of dan into the mountain : for they would not suffer they to come down to the valley :
but the amorites would dwell in mount heres in aijalon , and in shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of joseph prevail , so that they become tributary .
and the coast of the amorites be from the go up to akrabbim , from the rock , and upward .
and a angel of the lord come up from gilgal to bochim , and say , i make you to go up out of egypt , and have bring you unto the land which i sware unto you father ; and i say , i will never break my covenant with you .
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitant of this land ; ye shall throw down they altar : but ye have not obey my voice : why have ye do this ?
wherefore i also say , i will not drive they out from before you ; but they shall be as thorn in you side , and they god shall be a snare unto you .
and it come to pass , when the angel of the lord speak these word unto all the child of israel , that the people lift up they voice , and weep .
and they call the name of that place bochim : and they sacrifice there unto the lord .
and when joshua have let the people go , the child of israel go every man unto he inheritance to possess the land .
and the people serve the lord all the day of joshua , and all the day of the elder that outlive joshua , who have see all the great work of the lord , that he do for israel .
and joshua the son of nun , the servant of the lord , die , be a hundred and ten year old .
and they bury he in the border of he inheritance in timnathheres , in the mount of ephraim , on the north side of the hill gaash .
and also all that generation be gather unto they father : and there arise another generation after they , which know not the lord , nor yet the work which he have do for israel .
and the child of israel do evil in the sight of the lord , and serve baalim :
and they forsake the lord god of they father , which bring they out of the land of egypt , and follow other god , of the god of the people that be round about they , and bow themselves unto they , and provoke the lord to anger .
and they forsake the lord , and serve baal and ashtaroth .
and the anger of the lord be hot against israel , and he deliver they into the hand of spoiler that spoil they , and he sell they into the hand of they enemy round about , so that they could not any longer stand before they enemy .
whithersoever they go out , the hand of the lord be against they for evil , as the lord have say , and as the lord have swear unto they : and they be greatly distressed .
nevertheless the lord raise up judge , which deliver they out of the hand of those that spoil they .
and yet they would not hearken unto they judge , but they go a whoring after other god , and bow themselves unto they : they turn quickly out of the way which they father walk in , obey the commandment of the lord ; but they do not so .
and when the lord raise they up judge , then the lord be with the judge , and deliver they out of the hand of they enemy all the day of the judge : for it repent the lord because of they groaning by reason of they that oppress they and vex they .
and it come to pass , when the judge be dead , that they return , and corrupt themselves more than they father , in follow other god to serve they , and to bow down unto they ; they cease not from they own doings , nor from they stubborn way .
and the anger of the lord be hot against israel ; and he say , because that this people have transgress my covenant which i command they father , and have not hearken unto my voice ;
i also will not henceforth drive out any from before they of the nation which joshua leave when he die :
that through they i may prove israel , whether they will keep the way of the lord to walk therein , as they father do keep it , or not .
therefore the lord leave those nation , without drive they out hastily ; neither deliver he they into the hand of joshua .
now these be the nation which the lord leave , to prove israel by they , even as many of israel as have not know all the war of canaan ;
only that the generation of the child of israel might know , to teach they war , at the least such as before know nothing thereof ;
namely , five lord of the philistines , and all the canaanites , and the sidonians , and the hivite that dwell in mount lebanon , from mount baalhermon unto the enter in of hamath .
and they be to prove israel by they , to know whether they would hearken unto the commandment of the lord , which he command they father by the hand of moses .
and the child of israel dwelt among the canaanites , hittites , and amorites , and perizzites , and hivites , and jebusites :
and they take they daughter to be they wife , and give they daughter to they son , and serve they god .
and the child of israel do evil in the sight of the lord , and forgat the lord they god , and serve baalim and the grove .
therefore the anger of the lord be hot against israel , and he sell they into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia : and the child of israel serve chushanrishathaim eight year .
and when the child of israel cry unto the lord , the lord raise up a deliverer to the child of israel , who deliver they , even othniel the son of kenaz , caleb 's younger brother .
and the spirit of the lord come upon he , and he judge israel , and go out to war : and the lord deliver chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia into he hand ; and he hand prevail against chushanrishathaim .
and the land have rest forty year .
and othniel the son of kenaz die .
and the child of israel do evil again in the sight of the lord : and the lord strengthen eglon the king of moab against israel , because they have do evil in the sight of the lord .
and he gather unto he the child of ammon and amalek , and go and smite israel , and possess the city of palm tree .
so the child of israel serve eglon the king of moab eighteen year .
but when the child of israel cry unto the lord , the lord raise they up a deliverer , ehud the son of gera , a benjamite , a man lefthand : and by he the child of israel send a present unto eglon the king of moab .
but ehud make he a dagger which have two edge , of a cubit length ; and he do gird it under he raiment upon he right thigh .
and he bring the present unto eglon king of moab : and eglon be a very fat man .
and when he have make a end to offer the present , he send away the people that bare the present .
but he himself turn again from the quarry that be by gilgal , and say , i have a secret errand unto thee , o king : who say , keep silence .
and all that stand by he go out from he .
and ehud come unto he ; and he be sit in a summer parlour , which he have for himself alone .
and ehud say , i have a message from god unto thee .
and he arise out of he seat .
and ehud put forth he left hand , and take the dagger from he right thigh , and thrust it into he belly :
and the haft also go in after the blade ; and the fat close upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of he belly ; and the dirt come out .
then ehud go forth through the porch , and shut the door of the parlour upon he , and lock they .
when he be go out , he servant come ; and when they see that , behold , the door of the parlour be lock , they say , surely he covereth he foot in he summer chamber .
and they tarry till they be ashamed : and , behold , he open not the door of the parlour ; therefore they take a key , and open they : and , behold , they lord be fall down dead on the earth .
and ehud escape while they tarry , and pass beyond the quarry , and escape unto seirath .
and it come to pass , when he be come , that he blow a trumpet in the mountain of ephraim , and the child of israel go down with he from the mount , and he before they .
and he say unto they , follow after i : for the lord have deliver you enemy the moabites into you hand .
and they go down after he , and take the ford of jordan toward moab , and suffer not a man to pass over .
and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand man , all lusty , and all man of valour ; and there escape not a man .
so moab be subdue that day under the hand of israel .
and the land have rest fourscore year .
and after he be shamgar the son of anath , which slew of the philistines six hundred man with a ox goad : and he also deliver israel .
and the child of israel again do evil in the sight of the lord , when ehud be dead .
and the lord sell they into the hand of jabin king of canaan , that reign in hazor ; the captain of whose host be sisera , which dwell in harosheth of the gentiles .
and the child of israel cry unto the lord : for he have nine hundred chariot of iron ; and twenty year he mightily oppress the child of israel .
and deborah , a prophetess , the wife of lapidoth , she judge israel at that time .
and she dwell under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in mount ephraim : and the child of israel come up to she for judgment .
and she send and call barak the son of abinoam out of kedeshnaphtali , and say unto he , hath not the lord god of israel command , say , go and draw toward mount tabor , and take with thee ten thousand man of the child of naphtali and of the child of zebulun ?
and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera , the captain of jabin 's army , with he chariot and he multitude ; and i will deliver he into thine hand .
and barak say unto she , if thou wilt go with i , then i will go : but if thou wilt not go with i , then i will not go .
and she say , i will surely go with thee : notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour ; for the lord shall sell sisera into the hand of a woman .
and deborah arise , and go with barak to kedesh .
and barak call zebulun and naphtali to kedesh ; and he go up with ten thousand man at he foot : and deborah go up with he .
now heber the kenite , which be of the child of hobab the father in law of moses , have sever himself from the kenites , and pitch he tent unto the plain of zaanaim , which be by kedesh .
and they shew sisera that barak the son of abinoam be go up to mount tabor .
and sisera gather together all he chariot , even nine hundred chariot of iron , and all the people that be with he , from harosheth of the gentiles unto the river of kishon .
and deborah say unto barak , up ; for this be the day in which the lord have deliver sisera into thine hand : be not the lord go out before thee ?
so barak go down from mount tabor , and ten thousand man after he .
and the lord discomfited sisera , and all he chariot , and all he host , with the edge of the sword before barak ; so that sisera light down off he chariot , and flee away on he foot .
but barak pursue after the chariot , and after the host , unto harosheth of the gentiles : and all the host of sisera fall upon the edge of the sword ; and there be not a man leave .
howbeit sisera flee away on he foot to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite : for there be peace between jabin the king of hazor and the house of heber the kenite .
and jael go out to meet sisera , and say unto he , turn in , my lord , turn in to i ; fear not .
and when he have turn in unto she into the tent , she cover he with a mantle .
and he say unto she , give i , i pray thee , a little water to drink ; for i be thirsty .
and she open a bottle of milk , and give he drink , and cover he .
again he say unto she , stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man doth come and enquire of thee , and say , be there any man here ? that thou shalt say , no. .
then jael heber 's wife take a nail of the tent , and take a hammer in she hand , and go softly unto he , and smite the nail into he temple , and fasten it into the ground : for he be fast asleep and weary .
so he die .
and , behold , as barak pursue sisera , jael come out to meet he , and say unto he , come , and i will shew thee the man whom thou seekest .
and when he come into she tent , behold , sisera lay dead , and the nail be in he temple .
so god subdue on that day jabin the king of canaan before the child of israel .
and the hand of the child of israel prosper , and prevail against jabin the king of canaan , until they have destroy jabin king of canaan .
then sing deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day , say ,
praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel , when the people willingly offer themselves .
hear , o ye king ; give ear , o ye prince ; i , even i , will sing unto the lord ; i will sing praise to the lord god of israel .
lord , when thou wentest out of seir , when thou marchedst out of the field of edom , the earth tremble , and the heaven drop , the cloud also drop water .
the mountain melt from before the lord , even that sinai from before the lord god of israel .
in the day of shamgar the son of anath , in the day of jael , the highway be unoccupied , and the traveller walk through byway .
the inhabitant of the village cease , they cease in israel , until that i deborah arise , that i arise a mother in israel .
they choose new god ; then be war in the gate : be there a shield or spear see among forty thousand in israel ?
my heart be toward the governor of israel , that offer themselves willingly among the people .
bless ye the lord .
speak , ye that ride on white ass , ye that sit in judgment , and walk by the way .
they that be deliver from the noise of archer in the place of draw water , there shall they rehearse the righteous act of the lord , even the righteous act toward the inhabitant of he village in israel : then shall the people of the lord go down to the gate .
awake , awake , deborah : awake , awake , utter a song : arise , barak , and lead thy captivity captive , thou son of abinoam .
then he make he that remaineth have dominion over the noble among the people : the lord make i have dominion over the mighty .
out of ephraim be there a root of they against amalek ; after thee , benjamin , among thy people ; out of machir come down governor , and out of zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
and the prince of issachar be with deborah ; even issachar , and also barak : he be send on foot into the valley .
for the division of reuben there be great thought of heart .
why abodest thou among the sheepfold , to hear the bleating of the flock ?
for the division of reuben there be great searching of heart .
gilead abode beyond jordan : and why do dan remain in ship ?
asher continue on the sea shore , and abode in he breach .
zebulun and naphtali be a people that jeopard they life unto the death in the high place of the field .
the king come and fight , then fight the king of canaan in taanach by the water of megiddo ; they take no gain of money .
they fight from heaven ; the star in they course fight against sisera .
the river of kishon sweep they away , that ancient river , the river kishon .
o my soul , thou hast trodden down strength .
then be the horsehoof break by the means of the pransing , the pransing of they mighty one .
curse ye meroz , say the angel of the lord , curse ye bitterly the inhabitant thereof ; because they come not to the help of the lord , to the help of the lord against the mighty .
bless above woman shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be , bless shall she be above woman in the tent .
he ask water , and she give he milk ; she bring forth butter in a lordly dish .
she put she hand to the nail , and she right hand to the workman 's hammer ; and with the hammer she smite sisera , she smite off he head , when she have pierce and stricken through he temple .
at she foot he bow , he fall , he lay down : at she foot he bow , he fall : where he bow , there he fall down dead .
the mother of sisera look out at a window , and cry through the lattice , why be he chariot so long in come ? why tarry the wheel of he chariot ?
she wise lady answer she , yea , she return answer to herself ,
have they not speed ? have they not divide the prey ; to every man a damsel or two ; to sisera a prey of diver colour , a prey of diver colour of needlework , of diver colour of needlework on both side , meet for the neck of they that take the spoil ?
so let all thine enemy perish , o lord : but let they that love he be as the sun when he goeth forth in he might .
and the land have rest forty year .
and the child of israel do evil in the sight of the lord : and the lord deliver they into the hand of midian seven year .
and the hand of midian prevail against israel : and because of the midianites the child of israel make they the den which be in the mountain , and cave , and strong hold .
and so it be , when israel have sow , that the midianites come up , and the amalekites , and the child of the east , even they come up against they ;
and they encamp against they , and destroy the increase of the earth , till thou come unto gaza , and leave no sustenance for israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor ass .
for they come up with they cattle and they tent , and they come as grasshopper for multitude ; for both they and they camel be without number : and they enter into the land to destroy it .
and israel be greatly impoverished because of the midianites ; and the child of israel cry unto the lord .
and it come to pass , when the child of israel cry unto the lord because of the midianites ,
that the lord send a prophet unto the child of israel , which say unto they , thus saith the lord god of israel , i bring you up from egypt , and bring you forth out of the house of bondage ;
and i deliver you out of the hand of the egyptians , and out of the hand of all that oppressed you , and drave they out from before you , and give you they land ;
and i say unto you , i be the lord you god ; fear not the god of the amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but ye have not obey my voice .
and there come a angel of the lord , and sit under a oak which be in ophrah , that pertain unto joash the abiezrite : and he son gideon thresh wheat by the winepress , to hide it from the midianites .
and the angel of the lord appear unto he , and say unto he , the lord be with thee , thou mighty man of valour .
and gideon say unto he , oh my lord , if the lord be with we , why then be all this befall we ? and where be all he miracle which we father tell we of , say , do not the lord bring we up from egypt ? but now the lord have forsake we , and deliver we into the hand of the midianites .
and the lord look upon he , and say , go in this thy might , and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites : have not i send thee ?
and he say unto he , oh my lord , wherewith shall i save israel ? behold , my family be poor in manasseh , and i be the least in my father 's house .
and the lord say unto he , surely i will be with thee , and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man .
and he say unto he , if now i have find grace in thy sight , then shew i a sign that thou talkest with i .
depart not hence , i pray thee , until i come unto thee , and bring forth my present , and set it before thee .
and he say , i will tarry until thou come again .
and gideon go in , and make ready a kid , and unleavened cake of a ephah of flour : the flesh he put in a basket , and he put the broth in a pot , and bring it out unto he under the oak , and present it .
and the angel of god say unto he , take the flesh and the unleavened cake , and lay they upon this rock , and pour out the broth .
and he do so .
then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that be in he hand , and touch the flesh and the unleavened cake ; and there rise up fire out of the rock , and consume the flesh and the unleavened cake .
then the angel of the lord depart out of he sight .
and when gideon perceive that he be a angel of the lord , gideon say , alas , o lord god ! for because i have see a angel of the lord face to face .
and the lord say unto he , peace be unto thee ; fear not : thou shalt not die .
then gideon build a altar there unto the lord , and call it jehovahshalom : unto this day it be yet in ophrah of the abiezrites .
and it come to pass the same night , that the lord say unto he , take thy father 's young bullock , even the second bullock of seven year old , and throw down the altar of baal that thy father have , and cut down the grove that be by it :
and build a altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock , in the order place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down .
then gideon take ten man of he servant , and do as the lord have say unto he : and so it be , because he fear he father 's household , and the man of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he do it by night .
and when the man of the city arise early in the morning , behold , the altar of baal be cast down , and the grove be cut down that be by it , and the second bullock be offer upon the altar that be build .
and they say one to another , who have do this thing ?
and when they enquire and ask , they say , gideon the son of joash have do this thing .
then the man of the city say unto joash , bring out thy son , that he may die : because he have cast down the altar of baal , and because he have cut down the grove that be by it .
and joash say unto all that stand against he , will ye plead for baal ? will ye save he ? he that will plead for he , let he be put to death whilst it be yet morning : if he be a god , let he plead for himself , because one have cast down he altar .
therefore on that day he call he jerubbaal , say , let baal plead against he , because he have throw down he altar .
then all the midianites and the amalekites and the child of the east be gather together , and go over , and pitch in the valley of jezreel .
but the spirit of the lord come upon gideon , and he blow a trumpet ; and abiezer be gather after he .
and he send messenger throughout all manasseh ; who also be gather after he : and he send messenger unto asher , and unto zebulun , and unto naphtalus ; and they come up to meet they .
and gideon say unto god , if thou wilt save israel by mine hand , as thou hast say ,
behold , i will put a fleece of wool in the floor ; and if the dew be on the fleece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand , as thou hast say .
and it be so : for he rise up early on the morrow , and thrust the fleece together , and wringe the dew out of the fleece , a bowl full of water .
and gideon say unto god , let not thine anger be hot against i , and i will speak but this once : let i prove , i pray thee , but this once with the fleece ; let it now be dry only upon the fleece , and upon all the ground let there be dew .
and god do so that night : for it be dry upon the fleece only , and there be dew on all the ground .
then jerubbaal , who be gideon , and all the people that be with he , rise up early , and pitch beside the well of harod : so that the host of the midianites be on the north side of they , by the hill of moreh , in the valley .
and the lord say unto gideon , the people that be with thee be too many for i to give the midianites into they hand , lest israel vaunt themselves against i , say , mine own hand have save i .
now therefore go to , proclaim in the ear of the people , say , whosoever be fearful and afraid , let he return and depart early from mount gilead .
and there return of the people twenty and two thousand ; and there remain ten thousand .
and the lord say unto gideon , the people be yet too many ; bring they down unto the water , and i will try they for thee there : and it shall be , that of whom i say unto thee , this shall go with thee , the same shall go with thee ; and of whomsoever i say unto thee , this shall not go with thee , the same shall not go .
so he bring down the people unto the water : and the lord say unto gideon , every one that lappeth of the water with he tongue , as a dog lappeth , he shalt thou set by himself ; likewise every one that boweth down upon he knee to drink .
and the number of they that lap , put they hand to they mouth , be three hundred man : but all the rest of the people bow down upon they knee to drink water .
and the lord say unto gideon , by the three hundred man that lap will i save you , and deliver the midianites into thine hand : and let all the other people go every man unto he place .
so the people take victuals in they hand , and they trumpet : and he send all the rest of israel every man unto he tent , and retain those three hundred man : and the host of midian be beneath he in the valley .
and it come to pass the same night , that the lord say unto he , arise , get thee down unto the host ; for i have deliver it into thine hand .
but if thou fear to go down , go thou with phurah thy servant down to the host :
and thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall thine hand be strengthen to go down unto the host .
then go he down with phurah he servant unto the outside of the armed man that be in the host .
and the midianites and the amalekites and all the child of the east lay along in the valley like grasshopper for multitude ; and they camel be without number , as the sand by the sea side for multitude .
and when gideon be come , behold , there be a man that tell a dream unto he fellow , and say , behold , i dream a dream , and , lo , a cake of barley bread tumble into the host of midian , and come unto a tent , and smite it that it fall , and overturn it , that the tent lay along .
and he fellow answer and say , this be nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash , a man of israel : for into he hand have god deliver midian , and all the host .
and it be so , when gideon hear the tell of the dream , and the interpretation thereof , that he worship , and return into the host of israel , and say , arise ; for the lord have deliver into you hand the host of midian .
and he divide the three hundred man into three company , and he put a trumpet in every man 's hand , with empty pitcher , and lamp within the pitcher .
and he say unto they , look on i , and do likewise : and , behold , when i come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that , as i do , so shall ye do .
when i blow with a trumpet , i and all that be with i , then blow ye the trumpet also on every side of all the camp , and say , the sword of the lord , and of gideon .
so gideon , and the hundred man that be with he , come unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch ; and they have but newly set the watch : and they blow the trumpet , and brake the pitcher that be in they hand .
and the three company blow the trumpet , and brake the pitcher , and hold the lamp in they left hand , and the trumpet in they right hand to blow withal : and they cry , the sword of the lord , and of gideon .
and they stand every man in he place round about the camp ; and all the host run , and cry , and flee .
and the three hundred blow the trumpet , and the lord set every man 's sword against he fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host flee to bethshittah in zererath , and to the border of abelmeholah , unto tabbath .
and the man of israel gather themselves together out of naphtali , and out of asher , and out of all manasseh , and pursue after the midianites .
and gideon send messenger throughout all mount ephraim , say , come down against the midianites , and take before they the water unto bethbarah and jordan .
then all the man of ephraim gather themselves together , and take the water unto bethbarah and jordan .
and they take two prince of the midianites , oreb and zeeb ; and they slew oreb upon the rock oreb , and zeeb they slew at the winepress of zeeb , and pursue midian , and bring the head of oreb and zeeb to gideon on the other side jordan .
and the man of ephraim say unto he , why hast thou serve we thus , that thou calledst we not , when thou wentest to fight with the midianites ?
and they do chide with he sharply .
and he say unto they , what have i do now in comparison of you ?
be not the gleaning of the grape of ephraim better than the vintage of abiezer ?
god have deliver into you hand the prince of midian , oreb and zeeb : and what be i able to do in comparison of you ?
then they anger be abate toward he , when he have say that .
and gideon come to jordan , and pass over , he , and the three hundred man that be with he , faint , yet pursue they .
and he say unto the man of succoth , give , i pray you , loaf of bread unto the people that follow i ; for they be faint , and i be pursue after zebah and zalmunna , king of midian .
and the prince of succoth say , be the hand of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thine army ?
and gideon say , therefore when the lord have deliver zebah and zalmunna into mine hand , then i will tear you flesh with the thorn of the wilderness and with brier .
and he go up thence to penuel , and spake unto they likewise : and the man of penuel answer he as the man of succoth have answer he .
and he spake also unto the man of penuel , say , when i come again in peace , i will break down this tower .
now zebah and zalmunna be in karkor , and they host with they , about fifteen thousand man , all that be leave of all the host of the child of the east : for there fall a hundred and twenty thousand man that draw sword .
and gideon go up by the way of they that dwelt in tent on the east of nobah and jogbehah , and smite the host : for the host be secure .
and when zebah and zalmunna flee , he pursue after they , and take the two king of midian , zebah and zalmunna , and discomfited all the host .
and gideon the son of joash return from battle before the sun be up ,
and catch a young man of the man of succoth , and enquire of he : and he describe unto he the prince of succoth , and the elder thereof , even threescore and seventeen man .
and he come unto the man of succoth , and say , behold zebah and zalmunna , with whom ye do upbraid i , say , be the hand of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thy man that be weary ?
and he take the elder of the city , and thorn of the wilderness and brier , and with they he teach the man of succoth .
and he beat down the tower of penuel , and slew the man of the city .
then say he unto zebah and zalmunna , what manner of man be they whom ye slew at tabor ?
and they answer , as thou art , so be they ; each one resemble the child of a king .
and he say , they be my brethren , even the son of my mother : as the lord liveth , if ye have save they alive , i would not slay you .
and he say unto jether he firstborn , up , and slay they .
but the youth draw not he sword : for he fear , because he be yet a youth .
then zebah and zalmunna say , rise thou , and fall upon we : for as the man be , so be he strength .
and gideon arise , and slew zebah and zalmunna , and take away the ornament that be on they camel ' neck .
then the man of israel say unto gideon , rule thou over we , both thou , and thy son , and thy son 's son also : for thou hast deliver we from the hand of midian .
and gideon say unto they , i will not rule over you , neither shall my son rule over you : the lord shall rule over you .
and gideon say unto they , i would desire a request of you , that ye would give i every man the earring of he prey .
( for they have golden earring , because they be ishmaelites . )
and they answer , we will willingly give they .
and they spread a garment , and do cast therein every man the earring of he prey .
and the weight of the golden earring that he request be a thousand and seven hundred shekel of gold ; beside ornament , and collar , and purple raiment that be on the king of midian , and beside the chain that be about they camel ' neck .
and gideon make a ephod thereof , and put it in he city , even in ophrah : and all israel go thither a whoring after it : which thing become a snare unto gideon , and to he house .
thus be midian subdue before the child of israel , so that they lift up they head no more .
and the country be in quietness forty year in the day of gideon .
and jerubbaal the son of joash go and dwelt in he own house .
and gideon have threescore and ten son of he body begotten : for he have many wife .
and he concubine that be in shechem , she also bare he a son , whose name he call abimelech .
and gideon the son of joash die in a good old age , and be bury in the sepulchre of joash he father , in ophrah of the abiezrites .
and it come to pass , as soon as gideon be dead , that the child of israel turn again , and go a whoring after baalim , and make baalberith they god .
and the child of israel remember not the lord they god , who have deliver they out of the hand of all they enemy on every side :
neither shew they kindness to the house of jerubbaal , namely , gideon , accord to all the goodness which he have shew unto israel .
and abimelech the son of jerubbaal go to shechem unto he mother 's brethren , and commune with they , and with all the family of the house of he mother 's father , say ,
speak , i pray you , in the ear of all the man of shechem , whether be better for you , either that all the son of jerubbaal , which be threescore and ten person , reign over you , or that one reign over you ? remember also that i be you bone and you flesh .
and he mother 's brethren spake of he in the ear of all the man of shechem all these word : and they heart incline to follow abimelech ; for they say , he be we brother .
and they give he threescore and ten piece of silver out of the house of baalberith , wherewith abimelech hire vain and light person , which follow he .
and he go unto he father 's house at ophrah , and slew he brethren the son of jerubbaal , be threescore and ten person , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal be leave ; for he hide himself .
and all the man of shechem gather together , and all the house of millo , and go , and make abimelech king , by the plain of the pillar that be in shechem .
and when they tell it to jotham , he go and stand in the top of mount gerizim , and lift up he voice , and cry , and say unto they , hearken unto i , ye man of shechem , that god may hearken unto you .
the tree go forth on a time to anoint a king over they ; and they say unto the olive tree , reign thou over we .
but the olive tree say unto they , should i leave my fatness , wherewith by i they honour god and man , and go to be promote over the tree ?
and the tree say to the fig tree , come thou , and reign over we .
but the fig tree say unto they , should i forsake my sweetness , and my good fruit , and go to be promote over the tree ?
then say the tree unto the vine , come thou , and reign over we .
and the vine say unto they , should i leave my wine , which cheereth god and man , and go to be promote over the tree ?
then say all the tree unto the bramble , come thou , and reign over we .
and the bramble say unto the tree , if in truth ye anoint i king over you , then come and put you trust in my shadow : and if not , let fire come out of the bramble , and devour the cedar of lebanon .
now therefore , if ye have do truly and sincerely , in that ye have make abimelech king , and if ye have deal well with jerubbaal and he house , and have do unto he accord to the deserving of he hand ;
( for my father fight for you , and adventure he life far , and deliver you out of the hand of midian :
and ye be rise up against my father 's house this day , and have slay he son , threescore and ten person , upon one stone , and have make abimelech , the son of he maidservant , king over the man of shechem , because he be you brother ; )
if ye then have deal truly and sincerely with jerubbaal and with he house this day , then rejoice ye in abimelech , and let he also rejoice in you :
but if not , let fire come out from abimelech , and devour the man of shechem , and the house of millo ; and let fire come out from the man of shechem , and from the house of millo , and devour abimelech .
and jotham run away , and flee , and go to beer , and dwelt there , for fear of abimelech he brother .
when abimelech have reign three year over israel ,
then god send a evil spirit between abimelech and the man of shechem ; and the man of shechem deal treacherously with abimelech :
that the cruelty do to the threescore and ten son of jerubbaal might come , and they blood be lay upon abimelech they brother , which slew they ; and upon the man of shechem , which aid he in the killing of he brethren .
and the man of shechem set lier in wait for he in the top of the mountain , and they rob all that come along that way by they : and it be tell abimelech .
and gaal the son of ebed come with he brethren , and go over to shechem : and the man of shechem put they confidence in he .
and they go out into the field , and gather they vineyard , and trode the grape , and make merry , and go into the house of they god , and do eat and drink , and curse abimelech .
and gaal the son of ebed say , who be abimelech , and who be shechem , that we should serve he ? be not he the son of jerubbaal ? and zebul he officer ? serve the man of hamor the father of shechem : for why should we serve he ?
and would to god this people be under my hand ! then would i remove abimelech .
and he say to abimelech , increase thine army , and come out .
and when zebul the ruler of the city hear the word of gaal the son of ebed , he anger be kindle .
and he send messenger unto abimelech privily , say , behold , gaal the son of ebed and he brethren be come to shechem ; and , behold , they fortify the city against thee .
now therefore up by night , thou and the people that be with thee , and lie in wait in the field :
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun be up , thou shalt rise early , and set upon the city : and , behold , when he and the people that be with he come out against thee , then mayest thou do to they as thou shalt find occasion .
and abimelech rise up , and all the people that be with he , by night , and they lay wait against shechem in four company .
and gaal the son of ebed go out , and stand in the enter of the gate of the city : and abimelech rise up , and the people that be with he , from lie in wait .
and when gaal see the people , he say to zebul , behold , there come people down from the top of the mountain .
and zebul say unto he , thou seest the shadow of the mountain as if they be man .
and gaal spake again and say , see there come people down by the middle of the land , and another company come along by the plain of meonenim .
then say zebul unto he , where be now thy mouth , wherewith thou saidst , who be abimelech , that we should serve he ? be not this the people that thou hast despise ? go out , i pray now , and fight with they .
and gaal go out before the man of shechem , and fight with abimelech .
and abimelech chase he , and he flee before he , and many be overthrow and wound , even unto the enter of the gate .
and abimelech dwelt at arumah : and zebul thrust out gaal and he brethren , that they should not dwell in shechem .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that the people go out into the field ; and they tell abimelech .
and he take the people , and divide they into three company , and lay wait in the field , and look , and , behold , the people be come forth out of the city ; and he rise up against they , and smite they .
and abimelech , and the company that be with he , rush forward , and stand in the enter of the gate of the city : and the two other company run upon all the people that be in the field , and slew they .
and abimelech fight against the city all that day ; and he take the city , and slew the people that be therein , and beat down the city , and sow it with salt .
and when all the man of the tower of shechem hear that , they enter into a hold of the house of the god berith .
and it be tell abimelech , that all the man of the tower of shechem be gather together .
and abimelech gat he up to mount zalmon , he and all the people that be with he ; and abimelech take a axe in he hand , and cut down a bough from the tree , and take it , and lay it on he shoulder , and say unto the people that be with he , what ye have see i do , make haste , and do as i have do .
and all the people likewise cut down every man he bough , and follow abimelech , and put they to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon they ; so that all the man of the tower of shechem die also , about a thousand man and woman .
then go abimelech to thebez , and encamp against thebez , and take it .
but there be a strong tower within the city , and thither flee all the man and woman , and all they of the city , and shut it to they , and gat they up to the top of the tower .
and abimelech come unto the tower , and fight against it , and go hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon abimelech 's head , and all to brake he skull .
then he call hastily unto the young man he armourbearer , and say unto he , draw thy sword , and slay i , that man say not of i , a woman slew he .
and he young man thrust he through , and he die .
and when the man of israel see that abimelech be dead , they depart every man unto he place .
thus god render the wickedness of abimelech , which he do unto he father , in slaying he seventy brethren :
and all the evil of the man of shechem do god render upon they head : and upon they come the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal .
and after abimelech there arise to defend israel tola the son of puah , the son of dodo , a man of issachar ; and he dwell in shamir in mount ephraim .
and he judge israel twenty and three year , and die , and be bury in shamir .
and after he arise jair , a gileadite , and judge israel twenty and two year .
and he have thirty son that ride on thirty ass colt , and they have thirty city , which be call havothjair unto this day , which be in the land of gilead .
and jair die , and be bury in camon .
and the child of israel do evil again in the sight of the lord , and serve baalim , and ashtaroth , and the god of syria , and the god of zidon , and the god of moab , and the god of the child of ammon , and the god of the philistines , and forsake the lord , and serve not he .
and the anger of the lord be hot against israel , and he sell they into the hand of the philistines , and into the hand of the child of ammon .
and that year they vex and oppress the child of israel : eighteen year , all the child of israel that be on the other side jordan in the land of the amorites , which be in gilead .
moreover the child of ammon pass over jordan to fight also against judah , and against benjamin , and against the house of ephraim ; so that israel be sore distressed .
and the child of israel cry unto the lord , say , we have sin against thee , both because we have forsake we god , and also serve baalim .
and the lord say unto the child of israel , do not i deliver you from the egyptians , and from the amorites , from the child of ammon , and from the philistines ?
the zidonians also , and the amalekites , and the maonites , do oppress you ; and ye cry to i , and i deliver you out of they hand .
yet ye have forsake i , and serve other god : wherefore i will deliver you no more .
go and cry unto the god which ye have choose ; let they deliver you in the time of you tribulation .
and the child of israel say unto the lord , we have sin : do thou unto we whatsoever seemeth good unto thee ; deliver we only , we pray thee , this day .
and they put away the strange god from among they , and serve the lord : and he soul be grieve for the misery of israel .
then the child of ammon be gather together , and encamp in gilead .
and the child of israel assemble themselves together , and encamp in mizpeh .
and the people and prince of gilead say one to another , what man be he that will begin to fight against the child of ammon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitant of gilead .
now jephthah the gileadite be a mighty man of valour , and he be the son of a harlot : and gilead beget jephthah .
and gilead 's wife bare he son ; and he wife 's son grow up , and they thrust out jephthah , and say unto he , thou shalt not inherit in we father 's house ; for thou art the son of a strange woman .
then jephthah flee from he brethren , and dwelt in the land of tob : and there be gather vain man to jephthah , and go out with he .
and it come to pass in process of time , that the child of ammon make war against israel .
and it be so , that when the child of ammon make war against israel , the elder of gilead go to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob :
and they say unto jephthah , come , and be we captain , that we may fight with the child of ammon .
and jephthah say unto the elder of gilead , do not ye hate i , and expel i out of my father 's house ? and why be ye come unto i now when ye be in distress ?
and the elder of gilead say unto jephthah , therefore we turn again to thee now , that thou mayest go with we , and fight against the child of ammon , and be we head over all the inhabitant of gilead .
and jephthah say unto the elder of gilead , if ye bring i home again to fight against the child of ammon , and the lord deliver they before i , shall i be you head ?
and the elder of gilead say unto jephthah , the lord be witness between we , if we do not so accord to thy word .
then jephthah go with the elder of gilead , and the people make he head and captain over they : and jephthah utter all he word before the lord in mizpeh .
and jephthah send messenger unto the king of the child of ammon , say , what hast thou to do with i , that thou art come against i to fight in my land ?
and the king of the child of ammon answer unto the messenger of jephthah , because israel take away my land , when they come up out of egypt , from arnon even unto jabbok , and unto jordan : now therefore restore those land again peaceably .
and jephthah send messenger again unto the king of the child of ammon :
and say unto he , thus saith jephthah , israel take not away the land of moab , nor the land of the child of ammon :
but when israel come up from egypt , and walk through the wilderness unto the red sea , and come to kadesh ;
then israel send messenger unto the king of edom , say , let i , i pray thee , pass through thy land : but the king of edom would not hearken thereto .
and in like manner they send unto the king of moab : but he would not consent : and israel abode in kadesh .
then they go along through the wilderness , and compass the land of edom , and the land of moab , and come by the east side of the land of moab , and pitch on the other side of arnon , but come not within the border of moab : for arnon be the border of moab .
and israel send messenger unto sihon king of the amorites , the king of heshbon ; and israel say unto he , let we pass , we pray thee , through thy land into my place .
but sihon trust not israel to pass through he coast : but sihon gather all he people together , and pitch in jahaz , and fight against israel .
and the lord god of israel deliver sihon and all he people into the hand of israel , and they smite they : so israel possess all the land of the amorites , the inhabitant of that country .
and they possess all the coast of the amorites , from arnon even unto jabbok , and from the wilderness even unto jordan .
so now the lord god of israel have dispossessed the amorites from before he people israel , and shouldest thou possess it ?
wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess ?
so whomsoever the lord we god shall drive out from before we , they will we possess .
and now art thou any thing better than balak the son of zippor , king of moab ? do he ever strive against israel , or do he ever fight against they ,
while israel dwelt in heshbon and she town , and in aroer and she town , and in all the city that be along by the coast of arnon , three hundred year ? why therefore do ye not recover they within that time ?
wherefore i have not sin against thee , but thou doest i wrong to war against i : the lord the judge be judge this day between the child of israel and the child of ammon .
howbeit the king of the child of ammon hearken not unto the word of jephthah which he send he .
then the spirit of the lord come upon jephthah , and he pass over gilead , and manasseh , and pass over mizpeh of gilead , and from mizpeh of gilead he pass over unto the child of ammon .
and jephthah vow a vow unto the lord , and say , if thou shalt without fail deliver the child of ammon into mine hand ,
then it shall be , that whatsoever cometh forth of the door of my house to meet i , when i return in peace from the child of ammon , shall surely be the lord 's , and i will offer it up for a burnt offering .
so jephthah pass over unto the child of ammon to fight against they ; and the lord deliver they into he hand .
and he smite they from aroer , even till thou come to minnith , even twenty city , and unto the plain of the vineyard , with a very great slaughter .
thus the child of ammon be subdue before the child of israel .
and jephthah come to mizpeh unto he house , and , behold , he daughter come out to meet he with timbrel and with dance : and she be he only child ; beside she he have neither son nor daughter .
and it come to pass , when he see she , that he rent he clothes , and say , alas , my daughter ! thou hast bring i very low , and thou art one of they that trouble i : for i have open my mouth unto the lord , and i can not go back .
and she say unto he , my father , if thou hast open thy mouth unto the lord , do to i accord to that which have proceed out of thy mouth ; forasmuch as the lord have take vengeance for thee of thine enemy , even of the child of ammon .
and she say unto she father , let this thing be do for i : let i alone two month , that i may go up and down upon the mountain , and bewail my virginity , i and my fellow .
and he say , go .
and he send she away for two month : and she go with she companion , and bewail she virginity upon the mountain .
and it come to pass at the end of two month , that she return unto she father , who do with she accord to he vow which he have vow : and she know no man .
and it be a custom in israel ,
that the daughter of israel go yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four day in a year .
and the man of ephraim gather themselves together , and go northward , and say unto jephthah , wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the child of ammon , and didst not call we to go with thee ? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire .
and jephthah say unto they , i and my people be at great strife with the child of ammon ; and when i call you , ye deliver i not out of they hand .
and when i see that ye deliver i not , i put my life in my hand , and pass over against the child of ammon , and the lord deliver they into my hand : wherefore then be ye come up unto i this day , to fight against i ?
then jephthah gather together all the man of gilead , and fight with ephraim : and the man of gilead smite ephraim , because they say , ye gileadites be fugitive of ephraim among the ephraimites , and among the manassites .
and the gileadites take the passage of jordan before the ephraimites : and it be so , that when those ephraimite which be escape say , let i go over ; that the man of gilead say unto he , art thou a ephraimite ?
if he say , nay ;
then say they unto he , say now shibboleth : and he say sibboleth : for he could not frame to pronounce it right .
then they take he , and slew he at the passage of jordan : and there fall at that time of the ephraimites forty and two thousand .
and jephthah judge israel six year .
then die jephthah the gileadite , and be bury in one of the city of gilead .
and after he ibzan of bethlehem judge israel .
and he have thirty son , and thirty daughter , whom he send abroad , and take in thirty daughter from abroad for he son .
and he judge israel seven year .
then die ibzan , and be bury at bethlehem .
and after he elon , a zebulonite , judge israel ; and he judge israel ten year .
and elon the zebulonite die , and be bury in aijalon in the country of zebulun .
and after he abdon the son of hillel , a pirathonite , judge israel .
and he have forty son and thirty nephew , that ride on threescore and ten ass colt : and he judge israel eight year .
and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite die , and be bury in pirathon in the land of ephraim , in the mount of the amalekites .
and the child of israel do evil again in the sight of the lord ; and the lord deliver they into the hand of the philistines forty year .
and there be a certain man of zorah , of the family of the danites , whose name be manoah ; and he wife be barren , and bare not .
and the angel of the lord appear unto the woman , and say unto she , behold now , thou art barren , and bearest not : but thou shalt conceive , and bear a son .
now therefore beware , i pray thee , and drink not wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing :
for , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no razor shall come on he head : for the child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines .
then the woman come and tell she husband , say , a man of god come unto i , and he countenance be like the countenance of a angel of god , very terrible : but i ask he not whence he be , neither tell he i he name :
but he say unto i , behold , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , neither eat any unclean thing : for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the womb to the day of he death .
then manoah intreat the lord , and say , o my lord , let the man of god which thou didst send come again unto we , and teach we what we shall do unto the child that shall be bear .
and god hearken to the voice of manoah ; and the angel of god come again unto the woman as she sit in the field : but manoah she husband be not with she .
and the woman make haste , and run , and shew she husband , and say unto he , behold , the man have appear unto i , that come unto i the other day .
and manoah arise , and go after he wife , and come to the man , and say unto he , art thou the man that spakest unto the woman ?
and he say , i be .
and manoah say , now let thy word come to pass .
how shall we order the child , and how shall we do unto he ?
and the angel of the lord say unto manoah , of all that i say unto the woman let she beware .
she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine , neither let she drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : all that i command she let she observe .
and manoah say unto the angel of the lord , i pray thee , let we detain thee , until we shall have make ready a kid for thee .
and the angel of the lord say unto manoah , though thou detain i , i will not eat of thy bread : and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the lord .
for manoah know not that he be a angel of the lord .
and manoah say unto the angel of the lord , what be thy name , that when thy saying come to pass we may do thee honour ?
and the angel of the lord say unto he , why askest thou thus after my name , see it be secret ?
so manoah take a kid with a meat offering , and offer it upon a rock unto the lord : and the angel do wonderously ; and manoah and he wife look on .
for it come to pass , when the flame go up toward heaven from off the altar , that the angel of the lord ascend in the flame of the altar .
and manoah and he wife look on it , and fall on they face to the ground .
but the angel of the lord do no more appear to manoah and to he wife .
then manoah know that he be a angel of the lord .
and manoah say unto he wife , we shall surely die , because we have see god .
but he wife say unto he , if the lord be please to kill we , he would not have receive a burnt offering and a meat offering at we hand , neither would he have shew we all these thing , nor would as at this time have tell we such thing as these .
and the woman bare a son , and call he name samson : and the child grow , and the lord bless he .
and the spirit of the lord begin to move he at time in the camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol .
and samson go down to timnath , and see a woman in timnath of the daughter of the philistines .
and he come up , and tell he father and he mother , and say , i have see a woman in timnath of the daughter of the philistines : now therefore get she for i to wife .
then he father and he mother say unto he , be there never a woman among the daughter of thy brethren , or among all my people , that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistine ?
and samson say unto he father , get she for i ; for she pleaseth i well .
but he father and he mother know not that it be of the lord , that he seek a occasion against the philistines : for at that time the philistines have dominion over israel .
then go samson down , and he father and he mother , to timnath , and come to the vineyard of timnath : and , behold , a young lion roar against he .
and the spirit of the lord come mightily upon he , and he rent he as he would have rent a kid , and he have nothing in he hand : but he tell not he father or he mother what he have do .
and he go down , and talk with the woman ; and she please samson well .
and after a time he return to take she , and he turn aside to see the carcase of the lion : and , behold , there be a swarm of bee and honey in the carcase of the lion .
and he take thereof in he hand , and go on eating , and come to he father and mother , and he give they , and they do eat : but he tell not they that he have take the honey out of the carcase of the lion .
so he father go down unto the woman : and samson make there a feast ; for so use the young man to do .
and it come to pass , when they see he , that they bring thirty companion to be with he .
and samson say unto they , i will now put forth a riddle unto you : if ye can certainly declare it i within the seven day of the feast , and find it out , then i will give you thirty sheet and thirty change of garment :
but if ye can not declare it i , then shall ye give i thirty sheet and thirty change of garment .
and they say unto he , put forth thy riddle , that we may hear it .
and he say unto they , out of the eater come forth meat , and out of the strong come forth sweetness .
and they could not in three day expound the riddle .
and it come to pass on the seventh day , that they say unto samson 's wife , entice thy husband , that he may declare unto we the riddle , lest we burn thee and thy father 's house with fire : have ye call we to take that we have ? be it not so ?
and samson 's wife weep before he , and say , thou dost but hate i , and lovest i not : thou hast put forth a riddle unto the child of my people , and hast not tell it i .
and he say unto she , behold , i have not tell it my father nor my mother , and shall i tell it thee ?
and she weep before he the seven day , while they feast last : and it come to pass on the seventh day , that he tell she , because she lay sore upon he : and she tell the riddle to the child of she people .
and the man of the city say unto he on the seventh day before the sun go down , what be sweeter than honey ?
and what be stronger than a lion ?
and he say unto they , if ye have not plow with my heifer , ye have not find out my riddle .
and the spirit of the lord come upon he , and he go down to ashkelon , and slew thirty man of they , and take they spoil , and give change of garment unto they which expound the riddle .
and he anger be kindle , and he go up to he father 's house .
but samson 's wife be give to he companion , whom he have use as he friend .
but it come to pass within a while after , in the time of wheat harvest , that samson visit he wife with a kid ; and he say , i will go in to my wife into the chamber .
but she father would not suffer he to go in .
and she father say , i verily think that thou hadst utterly hate she ; therefore i give she to thy companion : be not she younger sister fairer than she ? take she , i pray thee , instead of she .
and samson say concern they , now shall i be more blameless than the philistines , though i do they a displeasure .
and samson go and catch three hundred fox , and take firebrand , and turn tail to tail , and put a firebrand in the midst between two tail .
and when he have set the brand on fire , he let they go into the standing corn of the philistines , and burn up both the shock , and also the standing corn , with the vineyard and olive .
then the philistines say , who have do this ?
and they answer , samson , the son in law of the timnite , because he have take he wife , and give she to he companion .
and the philistines come up , and burn she and she father with fire .
and samson say unto they , though ye have do this , yet will i be avenge of you , and after that i will cease .
and he smite they hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he go down and dwell in the top of the rock etam .
then the philistines go up , and pitch in judah , and spread themselves in lehi .
and the man of judah say , why be ye come up against we ?
and they answer , to bind samson be we come up , to do to he as he have do to we .
then three thousand man of judah go to the top of the rock etam , and say to samson , knowest thou not that the philistine be ruler over we ? what be this that thou hast do unto we ?
and he say unto they , as they do unto i , so have i do unto they .
and they say unto he , we be come down to bind thee , that we may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines .
and samson say unto they , swear unto i , that ye will not fall upon i yourselve .
and they speak unto he , say , no ; but we will bind thee fast , and deliver thee into they hand : but surely we will not kill thee .
and they bind he with two new cord , and bring he up from the rock .
and when he come unto lehi , the philistines shout against he : and the spirit of the lord come mightily upon he , and the cord that be upon he arm become as flax that be burn with fire , and he band loose from off he hand .
and he find a new jawbone of a ass , and put forth he hand , and take it , and slew a thousand man therewith .
and samson say , with the jawbone of a ass , heap upon heap , with the jaw of a ass have i slay a thousand man .
and it come to pass , when he have make a end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of he hand , and call that place ramathlehus .
and he be sore athirst , and call on the lord , and say , thou hast give this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant : and now shall i die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ?
but god cleave a hollow place that be in the jaw , and there come water thereout ; and when he have drunk , he spirit come again , and he revive : wherefore he call the name thereof enhakkore , which be in lehi unto this day .
and he judge israel in the day of the philistines twenty year .
then go samson to gaza , and see there a harlot , and go in unto she .
and it be tell the gazites , say , samson be come hither .
and they compass he in , and lay wait for he all night in the gate of the city , and be quiet all the night , say , in the morning , when it be day , we shall kill he .
and samson lay till midnight , and arise at midnight , and take the door of the gate of the city , and the two post , and go away with they , bar and all , and put they upon he shoulder , and carry they up to the top of a hill that be before hebron .
and it come to pass afterward , that he love a woman in the valley of sorek , whose name be delilah .
and the lord of the philistines come up unto she , and say unto she , entice he , and see wherein he great strength lieth , and by what mean we may prevail against he , that we may bind he to afflict he : and we will give thee every one of we eleven hundred piece of silver .
and delilah say to samson , tell i , i pray thee , wherein thy great strength lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bind to afflict thee .
and samson say unto she , if they bind i with seven green with that be never dry , then shall i be weak , and be as another man .
then the lord of the philistine bring up to she seven green with which have not be dry , and she bind he with they .
now there be man lie in wait , abide with she in the chamber .
and she say unto he , the philistines be upon thee , samson .
and he brake the with , as a thread of tow be break when it toucheth the fire .
so he strength be not know .
and delilah say unto samson , behold , thou hast mock i , and tell i lie : now tell i , i pray thee , wherewith thou mightest be bind .
and he say unto she , if they bind i fast with new rope that never be occupy , then shall i be weak , and be as another man .
delilah therefore take new rope , and bind he therewith , and say unto he , the philistines be upon thee , samson .
and there be lier in wait abide in the chamber .
and he brake they from off he arm like a thread .
and delilah say unto samson , hitherto thou hast mock i , and tell i lie : tell i wherewith thou mightest be bind .
and he say unto she , if thou weavest the seven lock of my head with the web .
and she fasten it with the pin , and say unto he , the philistines be upon thee , samson .
and he awake out of he sleep , and go away with the pin of the beam , and with the web .
and she say unto he , how canst thou say , i love thee , when thine heart be not with i ? thou hast mock i these three time , and hast not tell i wherein thy great strength lieth .
and it come to pass , when she press he daily with she word , and urge he , so that he soul be vex unto death ;
that he tell she all he heart , and say unto she , there have not come a razor upon mine head ; for i have be a nazarite unto god from my mother 's womb : if i be shave , then my strength will go from i , and i shall become weak , and be like any other man .
and when delilah see that he have tell she all he heart , she send and call for the lord of the philistines , say , come up this once , for he have shew i all he heart .
then the lord of the philistines come up unto she , and bring money in they hand .
and she make he sleep upon she knee ; and she call for a man , and she cause he to shave off the seven lock of he head ; and she begin to afflict he , and he strength go from he .
and she say , the philistines be upon thee , samson .
and he awake out of he sleep , and say , i will go out as at other time before , and shake myself .
and he wist not that the lord be depart from he .
but the philistines take he , and put out he eye , and bring he down to gaza , and bind he with fetter of brass ; and he do grind in the prison house .
howbeit the hair of he head begin to grow again after he be shaven .
then the lord of the philistines gather they together for to offer a great sacrifice unto dagon they god , and to rejoice : for they say , we god have deliver samson we enemy into we hand .
and when the people see he , they praise they god : for they say , we god have deliver into we hand we enemy , and the destroyer of we country , which slew many of we .
and it come to pass , when they heart be merry , that they say , call for samson , that he may make we sport .
and they call for samson out of the prison house ; and he make they sport : and they set he between the pillar .
and samson say unto the lad that hold he by the hand , suffer i that i may feel the pillar whereupon the house standeth , that i may lean upon they .
now the house be full of man and woman ; and all the lord of the philistines be there ; and there be upon the roof about three thousand man and woman , that beheld while samson make sport .
and samson call unto the lord , and say , o lord god , remember i , i pray thee , and strengthen i , i pray thee , only this once , o god , that i may be at once avenge of the philistines for my two eye .
and samson take hold of the two middle pillar upon which the house stand , and on which it be bear up , of the one with he right hand , and of the other with he left .
and samson say , let i die with the philistines .
and he bow himself with all he might ; and the house fall upon the lord , and upon all the people that be therein .
so the dead which he slew at he death be more than they which he slew in he life .
then he brethren and all the house of he father come down , and take he , and bring he up , and bury he between zorah and eshtaol in the buryingplace of manoah he father .
and he judge israel twenty year .
and there be a man of mount ephraim , whose name be micah .
and he say unto he mother , the eleven hundred shekel of silver that be take from thee , about which thou cursedst , and spakest of also in mine ear , behold , the silver be with i ; i take it .
and he mother say , bless be thou of the lord , my son .
and when he have restore the eleven hundred shekel of silver to he mother , he mother say , i have wholly dedicate the silver unto the lord from my hand for my son , to make a graven image and a molten image : now therefore i will restore it unto thee .
yet he restore the money unto he mother ; and he mother take two hundred shekel of silver , and give they to the founder , who make thereof a graven image and a molten image : and they be in the house of micah .
and the man micah have a house of god , and make a ephod , and teraphim , and consecrate one of he son , who become he priest .
in those day there be no king in israel , but every man do that which be right in he own eye .
and there be a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family of judah , who be a levite , and he sojourn there .
and the man depart out of the city from bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place : and he come to mount ephraim to the house of micah , as he journey .
and micah say unto he , whence comest thou ?
and he say unto he , i be a levite of bethlehemjudah , and i go to sojourn where i may find a place .
and micah say unto he , dwell with i , and be unto i a father and a priest , and i will give thee ten shekel of silver by the year , and a suit of apparel , and thy victuals .
so the levite go in .
and the levite be content to dwell with the man ; and the young man be unto he as one of he son .
and micah consecrate the levite ; and the young man become he priest , and be in the house of micah .
then say micah , now know i that the lord will do i good , see i have a levite to my priest .
in those day there be no king in israel : and in those day the tribe of the danites seek they a inheritance to dwell in ; for unto that day all they inheritance have not fall unto they among the tribe of israel .
and the child of dan send of they family five man from they coast , man of valour , from zorah , and from eshtaol , to spy out the land , and to search it ; and they say unto they , go , search the land : who when they come to mount ephraim , to the house of micah , they lodge there .
when they be by the house of micah , they know the voice of the young man the levite : and they turn in thither , and say unto he , who bring thee hither ? and what makest thou in this place ? and what hast thou here ?
and he say unto they , thus and thus dealeth micah with i , and have hire i , and i be he priest .
and they say unto he , ask counsel , we pray thee , of god , that we may know whether we way which we go shall be prosperous .
and the priest say unto they , go in peace : before the lord be you way wherein ye go .
then the five man depart , and come to laish , and see the people that be therein , how they dwell careless , after the manner of the zidonians , quiet and secure ; and there be no magistrate in the land , that might put they to shame in any thing ; and they be far from the zidonians , and have no business with any man .
and they come unto they brethren to zorah and eshtaol : and they brethren say unto they , what say ye ?
and they say , arise , that we may go up against they : for we have see the land , and , behold , it be very good : and be ye still ? be not slothful to go , and to enter to possess the land .
when ye go , ye shall come unto a people secure , and to a large land : for god have give it into you hand ; a place where there be no want of any thing that be in the earth .
and there go from thence of the family of the danites , out of zorah and out of eshtaol , six hundred man appoint with weapon of war .
and they go up , and pitch in kirjathjearim , in judah : wherefore they call that place mahanehdan unto this day : behold , it be behind kirjathjearim .
and they pass thence unto mount ephraim , and come unto the house of micah .
then answer the five man that go to spy out the country of laish , and say unto they brethren , do ye know that there be in these house a ephod , and teraphim , and a graven image , and a molten image ? now therefore consider what ye have to do .
and they turn thitherward , and come to the house of the young man the levite , even unto the house of micah , and salute he .
and the six hundred man appoint with they weapon of war , which be of the child of dan , stand by the enter of the gate .
and the five man that go to spy out the land go up , and come in thither , and take the graven image , and the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image : and the priest stand in the enter of the gate with the six hundred man that be appoint with weapon of war .
and these go into micah 's house , and fetch the carve image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image .
then say the priest unto they , what do ye ?
and they say unto he , hold thy peace , lay thine hand upon thy mouth , and go with we , and be to we a father and a priest : be it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man , or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in israel ?
and the priest 's heart be glad , and he take the ephod , and the teraphim , and the graven image , and go in the midst of the people .
so they turn and depart , and put the little one and the cattle and the carriage before they .
and when they be a good way from the house of micah , the man that be in the house near to micah 's house be gather together , and overtake the child of dan .
and they cry unto the child of dan .
and they turn they face , and say unto micah , what aileth thee , that thou comest with such a company ?
and he say , ye have take away my god which i make , and the priest , and ye be go away : and what have i more ? and what be this that ye say unto i , what aileth thee ?
and the child of dan say unto he , let not thy voice be hear among we , lest angry fellow run upon thee , and thou lose thy life , with the life of thy household .
and the child of dan go they way : and when micah see that they be too strong for he , he turn and go back unto he house .
and they take the thing which micah have make , and the priest which he have , and come unto laish , unto a people that be at quiet and secure : and they smite they with the edge of the sword , and burn the city with fire .
and there be no deliverer , because it be far from zidon , and they have no business with any man ; and it be in the valley that lieth by bethrehob .
and they build a city , and dwelt therein .
and they call the name of the city dan , after the name of dan they father , who be bear unto israel : howbeit the name of the city be laish at the first .
and the child of dan set up the graven image : and jonathan , the son of gershom , the son of manasseh , he and he son be priest to the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land .
and they set they up micah 's graven image , which he make , all the time that the house of god be in shiloh .
and it come to pass in those day , when there be no king in israel , that there be a certain levite sojourn on the side of mount ephraim , who take to he a concubine out of bethlehemjudah .
and he concubine play the whore against he , and go away from he unto she father 's house to bethlehemjudah , and be there four whole month .
and she husband arise , and go after she , to speak friendly unto she , and to bring she again , have he servant with he , and a couple of ass : and she bring he into she father 's house : and when the father of the damsel see he , he rejoice to meet he .
and he father in law , the damsel 's father , retain he ; and he abode with he three day : so they do eat and drink , and lodge there .
and it come to pass on the fourth day , when they arise early in the morning , that he rise up to depart : and the damsel 's father say unto he son in law , comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go you way .
and they sit down , and do eat and drink both of they together : for the damsel 's father have say unto the man , be content , i pray thee , and tarry all night , and let thine heart be merry .
and when the man rise up to depart , he father in law urge he : therefore he lodge there again .
and he arise early in the morning on the fifth day to depart : and the damsel 's father say , comfort thine heart , i pray thee .
and they tarry until afternoon , and they do eat both of they .
and when the man rise up to depart , he , and he concubine , and he servant , he father in law , the damsel 's father , say unto he , behold , now the day draweth toward evening , i pray you tarry all night : behold , the day groweth to a end , lodge here , that thine heart may be merry ; and to morrow get you early on you way , that thou mayest go home .
but the man would not tarry that night , but he rise up and depart , and come over against jebus , which be jerusalem ; and there be with he two ass saddle , he concubine also be with he .
and when they be by jebus , the day be far spend ; and the servant say unto he master , come , i pray thee , and let we turn in into this city of the jebusites , and lodge in it .
and he master say unto he , we will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger , that be not of the child of israel ; we will pass over to gibeah .
and he say unto he servant , come , and let we draw near to one of these place to lodge all night , in gibeah , or in ramah .
and they pass on and go they way ; and the sun go down upon they when they be by gibeah , which belongeth to benjamin .
and they turn aside thither , to go in and to lodge in gibeah : and when he go in , he sit he down in a street of the city : for there be no man that take they into he house to lodging .
and , behold , there come a old man from he work out of the field at even , which be also of mount ephraim ; and he sojourn in gibeah : but the man of the place be benjamites .
and when he have lift up he eye , he see a wayfaring man in the street of the city : and the old man say , whither goest thou ? and whence comest thou ?
and he say unto he , we be pass from bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim ; from thence be i : and i go to bethlehemjudah , but i be now go to the house of the lord ; and there be no man that receiveth i to house .
yet there be both straw and provender for we ass ; and there be bread and wine also for i , and for thy handmaid , and for the young man which be with thy servant : there be no want of any thing .
and the old man say , peace be with thee ; howsoever let all thy want lie upon i ; only lodge not in the street .
so he bring he into he house , and give provender unto the ass : and they wash they foot , and do eat and drink .
now as they be make they heart merry , behold , the man of the city , certain son of belial , beset the house round about , and beat at the door , and spake to the master of the house , the old man , say , bring forth the man that come into thine house , that we may know he .
and the man , the master of the house , go out unto they , and say unto they , nay , my brethren , nay , i pray you , do not so wickedly ; see that this man be come into mine house , do not this folly .
behold , here be my daughter a maiden , and he concubine ; they i will bring out now , and humble ye they , and do with they what seemeth good unto you : but unto this man do not so vile a thing .
but the man would not hearken to he : so the man take he concubine , and bring she forth unto they ; and they know she , and abuse she all the night until the morning : and when the day begin to spring , they let she go .
then come the woman in the dawn of the day , and fall down at the door of the man 's house where she lord be , till it be light .
and she lord rise up in the morning , and open the door of the house , and go out to go he way : and , behold , the woman he concubine be fall down at the door of the house , and she hand be upon the threshold .
and he say unto she , up , and let we be go .
but none answer .
then the man take she up upon a ass , and the man rise up , and gat he unto he place .
and when he be come into he house , he take a knife , and lay hold on he concubine , and divide she , together with she bone , into twelve piece , and send she into all the coast of israel .
and it be so , that all that see it say , there be no such deed do nor see from the day that the child of israel come up out of the land of egypt unto this day : consider of it , take advice , and speak you mind .
then all the child of israel go out , and the congregation be gather together as one man , from dan even to beersheba , with the land of gilead , unto the lord in mizpeh .
and the chief of all the people , even of all the tribe of israel , present themselves in the assembly of the people of god , four hundred thousand footman that draw sword .
( now the child of benjamin hear that the child of israel be go up to mizpeh . )
then say the child of israel , tell we , how be this wickedness ?
and the levite , the husband of the woman that be slay , answer and say , i come into gibeah that belongeth to benjamin , i and my concubine , to lodge .
and the man of gibeah rise against i , and beset the house round about upon i by night , and think to have slay i : and my concubine have they force , that she be dead .
and i take my concubine , and cut she in piece , and send she throughout all the country of the inheritance of israel : for they have commit lewdness and folly in israel .
behold , ye be all child of israel ; give here you advice and counsel .
and all the people arise as one man , say , we will not any of we go to he tent , neither will we any of we turn into he house .
but now this shall be the thing which we will do to gibeah ; we will go up by lot against it ;
and we will take ten man of a hundred throughout all the tribe of israel , and a hundred of a thousand , and a thousand out of ten thousand , to fetch victual for the people , that they may do , when they come to gibeah of benjamin , accord to all the folly that they have work in israel .
so all the man of israel be gather against the city , knit together as one man .
and the tribe of israel send man through all the tribe of benjamin , say , what wickedness be this that be do among you ?
now therefore deliver we the man , the child of belial , which be in gibeah , that we may put they to death , and put away evil from israel .
but the child of benjamin would not hearken to the voice of they brethren the child of israel :
but the child of benjamin gather themselves together out of the city unto gibeah , to go out to battle against the child of israel .
and the child of benjamin be number at that time out of the city twenty and six thousand man that draw sword , beside the inhabitant of gibeah , which be number seven hundred choose man .
among all this people there be seven hundred choose man lefthand ; every one could sling stone at a hair breadth , and not miss .
and the man of israel , beside benjamin , be number four hundred thousand man that draw sword : all these be man of war .
and the child of israel arise , and go up to the house of god , and ask counsel of god , and say , which of we shall go up first to the battle against the child of benjamin ?
and the lord say , judah shall go up first .
and the child of israel rise up in the morning , and encamp against gibeah .
and the man of israel go out to battle against benjamin ; and the man of israel put themselves in array to fight against they at gibeah .
and the child of benjamin come forth out of gibeah , and destroy down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and two thousand man .
and the people the man of israel encourage themselves , and set they battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
( and the child of israel go up and weep before the lord until even , and ask counsel of the lord , say , shall i go up again to battle against the child of benjamin my brother ?
and the lord say , go up against he . )
and the child of israel come near against the child of benjamin the second day .
and benjamin go forth against they out of gibeah the second day , and destroy down to the ground of the child of israel again eighteen thousand man ; all these draw the sword .
then all the child of israel , and all the people , go up , and come unto the house of god , and weep , and sit there before the lord , and fast that day until even , and offer burnt offering and peace offering before the lord .
and the child of israel enquire of the lord , ( for the ark of the covenant of god be there in those day ,
and phinehas , the son of eleazar , the son of aaron , stand before it in those day , ) say , shall i yet again go out to battle against the child of benjamin my brother , or shall i cease ?
and the lord say , go up ; for to morrow i will deliver they into thine hand .
and israel set lier in wait round about gibeah .
and the child of israel go up against the child of benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against gibeah , as at other time .
and the child of benjamin go out against the people , and be draw away from the city ; and they begin to smite of the people , and kill , as at other time , in the highway , of which one goeth up to the house of god , and the other to gibeah in the field , about thirty man of israel .
and the child of benjamin say , they be smite down before we , as at the first .
but the child of israel say , let we flee , and draw they from the city unto the highway .
and all the man of israel rise up out of they place , and put themselves in array at baaltamar : and the lier in wait of israel come forth out of they place , even out of the meadow of gibeah .
and there come against gibeah ten thousand choose man out of all israel , and the battle be sore : but they know not that evil be near they .
and the lord smite benjamin before israel : and the child of israel destroy of the benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred man : all these draw the sword .
so the child of benjamin see that they be smite : for the man of israel give place to the benjamites , because they trust unto the lier in wait which they have set beside gibeah .
and the lier in wait hast , and rush upon gibeah ; and the lier in wait draw themselves along , and smite all the city with the edge of the sword .
now there be a appoint sign between the man of israel and the lier in wait , that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city .
and when the man of israel retire in the battle , benjamin begin to smite and kill of the man of israel about thirty person : for they say , surely they be smite down before we , as in the first battle .
but when the flame begin to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke , the benjamites look behind they , and , behold , the flame of the city ascend up to heaven .
and when the man of israel turn again , the man of benjamin be amaze : for they see that evil be come upon they .
therefore they turn they back before the man of israel unto the way of the wilderness ; but the battle overtake they ; and they which come out of the city they destroy in the midst of they .
thus they inclose the benjamites round about , and chase they , and trode they down with ease over against gibeah toward the sunrising .
and there fall of benjamin eighteen thousand man ; all these be man of valour .
and they turn and flee toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon : and they glean of they in the highway five thousand man ; and pursued hard after they unto gidom , and slew two thousand man of they .
so that all which fall that day of benjamin be twenty and five thousand man that draw the sword ; all these be man of valour .
but six hundred man turn and flee to the wilderness unto the rock rimmon , and abode in the rock rimmon four month .
and the man of israel turn again upon the child of benjamin , and smite they with the edge of the sword , as well the man of every city , as the beast , and all that come to hand : also they set on fire all the city that they come to .
now the man of israel have swear in mizpeh , say , there shall not any of we give he daughter unto benjamin to wife .
and the people come to the house of god , and abode there till even before god , and lift up they voice , and weep sore ;
and say , o lord god of israel , why be this come to pass in israel , that there should be to day one tribe lack in israel ?
and it come to pass on the morrow , that the people rise early , and build there a altar , and offer burnt offering and peace offering .
and the child of israel say , who be there among all the tribe of israel that come not up with the congregation unto the lord ?
for they have make a great oath concern he that come not up to the lord to mizpeh , say , he shall surely be put to death .
and the child of israel repent they for benjamin they brother , and say , there be one tribe cut off from israel this day .
how shall we do for wife for they that remain , see we have swear by the lord that we will not give they of we daughter to wife ?
and they say , what one be there of the tribe of israel that come not up to mizpeh to the lord ?
and , behold , there come none to the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembly .
for the people be number , and , behold , there be none of the inhabitant of jabeshgilead there .
and the congregation send thither twelve thousand man of the valiantest , and command they , say , go and smite the inhabitant of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword , with the woman and the child .
and this be the thing that ye shall do , ye shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that have lain by man .
and they find among the inhabitant of jabeshgilead four hundred young virgin , that have know no man by lie with any male : and they bring they unto the camp to shiloh , which be in the land of canaan .
and the whole congregation send some to speak to the child of benjamin that be in the rock rimmon , and to call peaceably unto they .
and benjamin come again at that time ; and they give they wife which they have save alive of the woman of jabeshgilead : and yet so they suffice they not .
and the people repent they for benjamin , because that the lord have make a breach in the tribe of israel .
then the elder of the congregation say , how shall we do for wife for they that remain , see the woman be destroy out of benjamin ?
and they say , there must be a inheritance for they that be escape of benjamin , that a tribe be not destroy out of israel .
howbeit we may not give they wife of we daughter : for the child of israel have swear , say , cursed be he that giveth a wife to benjamin .
then they say , behold , there be a feast of the lord in shiloh yearly in a place which be on the north side of bethel , on the east side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem , and on the south of lebonah .
therefore they command the child of benjamin , say , go and lie in wait in the vineyard ;
and see , and , behold , if the daughter of shiloh come out to dance in dance , then come ye out of the vineyard , and catch you every man he wife of the daughter of shiloh , and go to the land of benjamin .
and it shall be , when they father or they brethren come unto we to complain , that we will say unto they , be favourable unto they for we sake : because we reserve not to each man he wife in the war : for ye do not give unto they at this time , that ye should be guilty .
and the child of benjamin do so , and take they wife , accord to they number , of they that dance , whom they catch : and they go and return unto they inheritance , and repair the city , and dwelt in they .
and the child of israel depart thence at that time , every man to he tribe and to he family , and they go out from thence every man to he inheritance .
in those day there be no king in israel : every man do that which be right in he own eye .
now it come to pass in the day when the judge rule , that there be a famine in the land .
and a certain man of bethlehemjudah go to sojourn in the country of moab , he , and he wife , and he two son .
and the name of the man be elimelech , and the name of he wife naomi , and the name of he two son mahlon and chilion , ephrathites of bethlehemjudah .
and they come into the country of moab , and continue there .
and elimelech naomi 's husband die ; and she be leave , and she two son .
and they take they wife of the woman of moab ; the name of the one be orpah , and the name of the other ruth : and they dwell there about ten year .
and mahlon and chilion die also both of they ; and the woman be leave of she two son and she husband .
then she arise with she daughter in law , that she might return from the country of moab : for she have hear in the country of moab how that the lord have visit he people in give they bread .
wherefore she go forth out of the place where she be , and she two daughter in law with she ; and they go on the way to return unto the land of judah .
and naomi say unto she two daughter in law , go , return each to she mother 's house : the lord deal kindly with you , as ye have deal with the dead , and with i .
the lord grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of she husband .
then she kiss they ; and they lift up they voice , and weep .
and they say unto she , surely we will return with thee unto thy people .
and naomi say , turn again , my daughter : why will ye go with i ? be there yet any more son in my womb , that they may be you husband ?
turn again , my daughter , go you way ; for i be too old to have a husband .
if i should say , i have hope , if i should have a husband also to night , and should also bear son ;
would ye tarry for they till they be grow ? would ye stay for they from have husband ? nay , my daughter ; for it grieveth i much for you sake that the hand of the lord be go out against i .
and they lift up they voice , and weep again : and orpah kiss she mother in law ; but ruth clave unto she .
and she say , behold , thy sister in law be go back unto she people , and unto she god : return thou after thy sister in law .
and ruth say , intreat i not to leave thee , or to return from follow after thee : for whither thou goest , i will go ; and where thou lodgest , i will lodge : thy people shall be my people , and thy god my god :
where thou diest , will i die , and there will i be bury : the lord do so to i , and more also , if ought but death part thee and i .
when she see that she be stedfastly mind to go with she , then she leave speak unto she .
so they two go until they come to bethlehem .
and it come to pass , when they be come to bethlehem , that all the city be move about they , and they say , be this naomi ?
and she say unto they , call i not naomi , call i mara : for the almighty have deal very bitterly with i .
i go out full , and the lord have bring i home again empty : why then call ye i naomi , see the lord have testify against i , and the almighty have afflict i ?
so naomi return , and ruth the moabitess , she daughter in law , with she , which return out of the country of moab : and they come to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
and naomi have a kinsman of she husband 's , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of elimelech ; and he name be boaz .
and ruth the moabitess say unto naomi , let i now go to the field , and glean ear of corn after he in whose sight i shall find grace .
and she say unto she , go , my daughter .
and she go , and come , and glean in the field after the reaper : and she hap be to light on a part of the field belong unto boaz , who be of the kindred of elimelech .
and , behold , boaz come from bethlehem , and say unto the reaper , the lord be with you .
and they answer he , the lord bless thee .
then say boaz unto he servant that be set over the reaper , whose damsel be this ?
and the servant that be set over the reaper answer and say , it be the moabitish damsel that come back with naomi out of the country of moab :
and she say , i pray you , let i glean and gather after the reaper among the sheaf : so she come , and have continue even from the morning until now , that she tarry a little in the house .
then say boaz unto ruth , hearest thou not , my daughter ?
go not to glean in another field , neither go from hence , but abide here fast by my maiden :
let thine eye be on the field that they do reap , and go thou after they : have i not charge the young man that they shall not touch thee ? and when thou art athirst , go unto the vessel , and drink of that which the young man have draw .
then she fall on she face , and bow herself to the ground , and say unto he , why have i find grace in thine eye , that thou shouldest take knowledge of i , see i be a stranger ?
and boaz answer and say unto she , it have fully be shew i , all that thou hast do unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband : and how thou hast leave thy father and thy mother , and the land of thy nativity , and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore .
the lord recompense thy work , and a full reward be give thee of the lord god of israel , under whose wing thou art come to trust .
then she say , let i find favour in thy sight , my lord ; for that thou hast comfort i , and for that thou hast speak friendly unto thine handmaid , though i be not like unto one of thine handmaiden .
and boaz say unto she , at mealtime come thou hither , and eat of the bread , and dip thy morsel in the vinegar .
and she sit beside the reaper : and he reach she parched corn , and she do eat , and be suffice , and leave .
and when she be rise up to glean , boaz command he young man , say , let she glean even among the sheaf , and reproach she not :
and let fall also some of the handful of purpose for she , and leave they , that she may glean they , and rebuke she not .
so she glean in the field until even , and beat out that she have glean : and it be about a ephah of barley .
and she take it up , and go into the city : and she mother in law see what she have glean : and she bring forth , and give to she that she have reserve after she be suffice .
and she mother in law say unto she , where hast thou glean to day ? and where wroughtest thou ? bless be he that do take knowledge of thee .
and she shew she mother in law with whom she have work , and say , the man 's name with whom i work to day be boaz .
and naomi say unto she daughter in law , bless be he of the lord , who have not leave off he kindness to the living and to the dead .
and naomi say unto she , the man be near of kin unto we , one of we next kinsman .
and ruth the moabitess say , he say unto i also , thou shalt keep fast by my young man , until they have end all my harvest .
and naomi say unto ruth she daughter in law , it be good , my daughter , that thou go out with he maiden , that they meet thee not in any other field .
so she keep fast by the maiden of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and dwell with she mother in law .
then naomi she mother in law say unto she , my daughter , shall i not seek rest for thee , that it may be well with thee ?
and now be not boaz of we kindred , with whose maiden thou wast ?
behold , he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor .
wash thyself therefore , and anoint thee , and put thy raiment upon thee , and get thee down to the floor : but make not thyself know unto the man , until he shall have do eating and drinking .
and it shall be , when he lieth down , that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie , and thou shalt go in , and uncover he foot , and lay thee down ; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do .
and she say unto she , all that thou sayest unto i i will do .
and she go down unto the floor , and do accord to all that she mother in law bid she .
and when boaz have eat and drunk , and he heart be merry , he go to lie down at the end of the heap of corn : and she come softly , and uncover he foot , and lay she down .
and it come to pass at midnight , that the man be afraid , and turn himself : and , behold , a woman lay at he foot .
and he say , who art thou ?
and she answer , i be ruth thine handmaid : spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid ; for thou art a near kinsman .
and he say , bless be thou of the lord , my daughter : for thou hast shew more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning , inasmuch as thou followedst not young man , whether poor or rich .
and now , my daughter , fear not ; i will do to thee all that thou requirest : for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman .
and now it be true that i be thy near kinsman : howbeit there be a kinsman nearer than i.
tarry this night , and it shall be in the morning , that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman , well ; let he do the kinsman 's part : but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee , then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee , as the lord liveth : lie down until the morning .
and she lay at he foot until the morning : and she rise up before one could know another .
and he say , let it not be know that a woman come into the floor .
also he say , bring the vail that thou hast upon thee , and hold it .
and when she hold it , he measure six measure of barley , and lay it on she : and she go into the city .
and when she come to she mother in law , she say , who art thou , my daughter ?
and she tell she all that the man have do to she .
and she say , these six measure of barley give he i ; for he say to i , go not empty unto thy mother in law .
then say she , sit still , my daughter , until thou know how the matter will fall : for the man will not be in rest , until he have finish the thing this day .
then go boaz up to the gate , and sit he down there : and , behold , the kinsman of whom boaz spake come by ; unto whom he say , ho , such a one ! turn aside , sit down here .
and he turn aside , and sit down .
and he take ten man of the elder of the city , and say , sit ye down here .
and they sit down .
and he say unto the kinsman , naomi , that be come again out of the country of moab , selleth a parcel of land , which be we brother elimelech 's :
and i think to advertise thee , say , buy it before the inhabitant , and before the elder of my people .
if thou wilt redeem it , redeem it : but if thou wilt not redeem it , then tell i , that i may know : for there be none to redeem it beside thee ; and i be after thee .
and he say , i will redeem it .
then say boaz , what day thou buyest the field of the hand of naomi , thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead upon he inheritance .
and the kinsman say , i can not redeem it for myself , lest i mar mine own inheritance : redeem thou my right to thyself ; for i can not redeem it .
now this be the manner in former time in israel concern redeeming and concern change , for to confirm all thing ; a man pluck off he shoe , and give it to he neighbour : and this be a testimony in israel .
therefore the kinsman say unto boaz , buy it for thee .
so he draw off he shoe .
and boaz say unto the elder , and unto all the people , ye be witness this day , that i have buy all that be elimelech 's , and all that be chilion 's and mahlon 's , of the hand of naomi .
moreover ruth the moabitess , the wife of mahlon , have i purchase to be my wife , to raise up the name of the dead upon he inheritance , that the name of the dead be not cut off from among he brethren , and from the gate of he place : ye be witness this day .
and all the people that be in the gate , and the elder , say , we be witness .
the lord make the woman that be come into thine house like rachel and like leah , which two do build the house of israel : and do thou worthily in ephratah , and be famous in bethlehem :
and let thy house be like the house of pharez , whom tamar bare unto judah , of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young woman .
so boaz take ruth , and she be he wife : and when he go in unto she , the lord give she conception , and she bare a son .
and the woman say unto naomi , blessed be the lord , which have not leave thee this day without a kinsman , that he name may be famous in israel .
and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life , and a nourisher of thine old age : for thy daughter in law , which loveth thee , which be better to thee than seven son , have bear he .
and naomi take the child , and lay it in she bosom , and become nurse unto it .
and the woman she neighbour give it a name , say , there be a son bear to naomi ; and they call he name obed : he be the father of jesse , the father of david .
now these be the generation of pharez : pharez beget hezron ,
and hezron beget ram , and ram beget amminadab ,
and amminadab beget nahshon , and nahshon beget salmon ,
and salmon beget boaz , and boaz beget obed ,
and obed beget jesse , and jesse beget david .
now there be a certain man of ramathaimzophim , of mount ephraim , and he name be elkanah , the son of jeroham , the son of elihu , the son of tohu , the son of zuph , a ephrathite :
and he have two wife ; the name of the one be hannah , and the name of the other peninnah : and peninnah have child , but hannah have no child .
and this man go up out of he city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord of host in shiloh .
and the two son of eli , hophni and phinehas , the priest of the lord , be there .
and when the time be that elkanah offer , he give to peninnah he wife , and to all she son and she daughter , portion :
but unto hannah he give a worthy portion ; for he love hannah : but the lord have shut up she womb .
and she adversary also provoke she sore , for to make she fret , because the lord have shut up she womb .
and as he do so year by year , when she go up to the house of the lord , so she provoke she ; therefore she weep , and do not eat .
then say elkanah she husband to she , hannah , why weepest thou ? and why eatest thou not ? and why be thy heart grieve ? be not i better to thee than ten son ?
so hannah rise up after they have eat in shiloh , and after they have drunk .
now eli the priest sit upon a seat by a post of the temple of the lord .
and she be in bitterness of soul , and pray unto the lord , and weep sore .
and she vow a vow , and say , o lord of host , if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid , and remember i , and not forget thine handmaid , but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child , then i will give he unto the lord all the day of he life , and there shall no razor come upon he head .
and it come to pass , as she continue pray before the lord , that eli mark she mouth .
now hannah , she speak in she heart ; only she lip move , but she voice be not hear : therefore eli think she have be drunken .
and eli say unto she , how long wilt thou be drunken ? put away thy wine from thee .
and hannah answer and say , no , my lord , i be a woman of a sorrowful spirit : i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink , but have pour out my soul before the lord .
count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial : for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have i speak hitherto .
then eli answer and say , go in peace : and the god of israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast ask of he .
and she say , let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight .
so the woman go she way , and do eat , and she countenance be no more sad .
and they rise up in the morning early , and worship before the lord , and return , and come to they house to ramah : and elkanah know hannah he wife ; and the lord remember she .
wherefore it come to pass , when the time be come about after hannah have conceive , that she bare a son , and call he name samuel , say , because i have ask he of the lord .
and the man elkanah , and all he house , go up to offer unto the lord the yearly sacrifice , and he vow .
but hannah go not up ; for she say unto she husband , i will not go up until the child be wean , and then i will bring he , that he may appear before the lord , and there abide for ever .
and elkanah she husband say unto she , do what seemeth thee good ; tarry until thou have wean he ; only the lord establish he word .
so the woman abode , and give she son suck until she wean he .
and when she have wean he , she take he up with she , with three bullock , and one ephah of flour , and a bottle of wine , and bring he unto the house of the lord in shiloh : and the child be young .
and they slew a bullock , and bring the child to eli .
and she say , oh my lord , as thy soul liveth , my lord , i be the woman that stand by thee here , pray unto the lord .
for this child i pray ; and the lord have give i my petition which i ask of he :
therefore also i have lend he to the lord ; as long as he liveth he shall be lend to the lord .
and he worship the lord there .
and hannah pray , and say , my heart rejoiceth in the lord , mine horn be exalt in the lord : my mouth be enlarged over mine enemy ; because i rejoice in thy salvation .
there be none holy as the lord : for there be none beside thee : neither be there any rock like we god .
talk no more so exceed proudly ; let not arrogancy come out of you mouth : for the lord be a god of knowledge , and by he action be weigh .
the bow of the mighty man be break , and they that stumble be gird with strength .
they that be full have hire out themselves for bread ; and they that be hungry cease : so that the barren have bear seven ; and she that have many child be wax feeble .
the lord killeth , and maketh alive : he bringeth down to the grave , and bringeth up .
the lord maketh poor , and maketh rich : he bringeth low , and lifteth up .
he raiseth up the poor out of the dust , and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill , to set they among prince , and to make they inherit the throne of glory : for the pillar of the earth be the lord 's , and he have set the world upon they .
he will keep the foot of he saint , and the wicked shall be silent in darkness ; for by strength shall no man prevail .
the adversary of the lord shall be break to piece ; out of heaven shall he thunder upon they : the lord shall judge the end of the earth ; and he shall give strength unto he king , and exalt the horn of he anointed .
and elkanah go to ramah to he house .
and the child do minister unto the lord before eli the priest .
now the son of eli be son of belial ; they know not the lord .
and the priest ' custom with the people be , that , when any man offer sacrifice , the priest 's servant come , while the flesh be in seething , with a fleshhook of three tooth in he hand ;
and he strike it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fleshhook bring up the priest take for himself .
so they do in shiloh unto all the israelites that come thither .
also before they burn the fat , the priest 's servant come , and say to the man that sacrifice , give flesh to roast for the priest ; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee , but raw .
and if any man say unto he , let they not fail to burn the fat presently , and then take as much as thy soul desireth ; then he would answer he , nay ; but thou shalt give it i now : and if not , i will take it by force .
wherefore the sin of the young man be very great before the lord : for man abhor the offering of the lord .
but samuel minister before the lord , be a child , gird with a linen ephod .
moreover he mother make he a little coat , and bring it to he from year to year , when she come up with she husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
and eli bless elkanah and he wife , and say , the lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which be lend to the lord .
and they go unto they own home .
and the lord visit hannah , so that she conceive , and bare three son and two daughter .
and the child samuel grow before the lord .
now eli be very old , and hear all that he son do unto all israel ; and how they lay with the woman that assemble at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and he say unto they , why do ye such thing ? for i hear of you evil dealings by all this people .
nay , my son ; for it be no good report that i hear : ye make the lord 's people to transgress .
if one man sin against another , the judge shall judge he : but if a man sin against the lord , who shall intreat for he ?
notwithstanding they hearken not unto the voice of they father , because the lord would slay they .
and the child samuel grow on , and be in favour both with the lord , and also with man .
and there come a man of god unto eli , and say unto he , thus saith the lord , do i plainly appear unto the house of thy father , when they be in egypt in pharaoh 's house ?
and do i choose he out of all the tribe of israel to be my priest , to offer upon mine altar , to burn incense , to wear a ephod before i ? and do i give unto the house of thy father all the offering make by fire of the child of israel ?
wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering , which i have command in my habitation ; and honourest thy son above i , to make yourselve fat with the chiefest of all the offering of israel my people ?
wherefore the lord god of israel saith , i say indeed that thy house , and the house of thy father , should walk before i for ever : but now the lord saith , be it far from i ; for they that honour i i will honour , and they that despise i shall be lightly esteem .
behold , the day come , that i will cut off thine arm , and the arm of thy father 's house , that there shall not be a old man in thine house .
and thou shalt see a enemy in my habitation , in all the wealth which god shall give israel : and there shall not be a old man in thine house for ever .
and the man of thine , whom i shall not cut off from mine altar , shall be to consume thine eye , and to grieve thine heart : and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of they age .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , that shall come upon thy two son , on hophni and phinehas ; in one day they shall die both of they .
and i will raise i up a faithful priest , that shall do accord to that which be in mine heart and in my mind : and i will build he a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anoint for ever .
and it shall come to pass , that every one that be leave in thine house shall come and crouch to he for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread , and shall say , put i , i pray thee , into one of the priest ' office , that i may eat a piece of bread .
and the child samuel minister unto the lord before eli .
and the word of the lord be precious in those day ; there be no open vision .
and it come to pass at that time , when eli be lay down in he place , and he eye begin to wax dim , that he could not see ;
and ere the lamp of god go out in the temple of the lord , where the ark of god be , and samuel be lay down to sleep ;
that the lord call samuel : and he answer , here be i.
and he run unto eli , and say , here be i ; for thou calledst i .
and he say , i call not ; lie down again .
and he go and lay down .
and the lord call yet again , samuel .
and samuel arise and go to eli , and say , here be i ; for thou didst call i .
and he answer , i call not , my son ; lie down again .
now samuel do not yet know the lord , neither be the word of the lord yet reveal unto he .
and the lord call samuel again the third time .
and he arise and go to eli , and say , here be i ; for thou didst call i .
and eli perceive that the lord have call the child .
therefore eli say unto samuel , go , lie down : and it shall be , if he call thee , that thou shalt say , speak , lord ; for thy servant heareth .
so samuel go and lay down in he place .
and the lord come , and stand , and call as at other time , samuel , samuel .
then samuel answer , speak ; for thy servant heareth .
and the lord say to samuel , behold , i will do a thing in israel , at which both the ear of every one that heareth it shall tingle .
in that day i will perform against eli all thing which i have speak concern he house : when i begin , i will also make a end .
for i have tell he that i will judge he house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth ; because he son make themselves vile , and he restrain they not .
and therefore i have swear unto the house of eli , that the iniquity of eli 's house shall not be purge with sacrifice nor offering for ever .
and samuel lay until the morning , and open the door of the house of the lord .
and samuel fear to shew eli the vision .
then eli call samuel , and say , samuel , my son .
and he answer , here be i.
and he say , what be the thing that the lord have say unto thee ?
i pray thee hide it not from i : god do so to thee , and more also , if thou hide any thing from i of all the thing that he say unto thee .
and samuel tell he every whit , and hide nothing from he .
and he say , it be the lord : let he do what seemeth he good .
and samuel grow , and the lord be with he , and do let none of he word fall to the ground .
and all israel from dan even to beersheba know that samuel be establish to be a prophet of the lord .
and the lord appear again in shiloh : for the lord reveal himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord .
and the word of samuel come to all israel .
now israel go out against the philistine to battle , and pitch beside ebenezer : and the philistines pitch in aphek .
and the philistines put themselves in array against israel : and when they join battle , israel be smite before the philistines : and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand man .
and when the people be come into the camp , the elder of israel say , wherefore have the lord smite we to day before the philistines ?
let we fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of shiloh unto we , that , when it cometh among we , it may save we out of the hand of we enemy .
so the people send to shiloh , that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of host , which dwelleth between the cherubim : and the two son of eli , hophni and phinehas , be there with the ark of the covenant of god .
and when the ark of the covenant of the lord come into the camp , all israel shout with a great shout , so that the earth ring again .
and when the philistines hear the noise of the shout , they say , what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews ?
and they understand that the ark of the lord be come into the camp .
and the philistines be afraid , for they say , god be come into the camp .
and they say , woe unto we ! for there have not be such a thing heretofore .
woe unto we ! who shall deliver we out of the hand of these mighty god ? these be the god that smite the egyptians with all the plague in the wilderness .
be strong , and quit yourselve like man , o ye philistine , that ye be not servant unto the hebrews , as they have be to you : quit yourselve like man , and fight .
and the philistines fight , and israel be smitten , and they flee every man into he tent : and there be a very great slaughter ; for there fall of israel thirty thousand footman .
and the ark of god be take ; and the two son of eli , hophni and phinehas , be slay .
and there run a man of benjamin out of the army , and come to shiloh the same day with he clothes rent , and with earth upon he head .
and when he come , lo , eli sit upon a seat by the wayside watching : for he heart tremble for the ark of god .
and when the man come into the city , and tell it , all the city cry out .
and when eli hear the noise of the cry , he say , what meaneth the noise of this tumult ?
and the man come in hastily , and tell eli .
now eli be ninety and eight year old ; and he eye be dim , that he could not see .
and the man say unto eli , i be he that come out of the army , and i flee to day out of the army .
and he say , what be there do , my son ?
and the messenger answer and say , israel be flee before the philistines , and there have be also a great slaughter among the people , and thy two son also , hophni and phinehas , be dead , and the ark of god be take .
and it come to pass , when he make mention of the ark of god , that he fall from off the seat backward by the side of the gate , and he neck brake , and he die : for he be a old man , and heavy .
and he have judge israel forty year .
and he daughter in law , phinehas ' wife , be with child , near to be deliver : and when she hear the tiding that the ark of god be take , and that she father in law and she husband be dead , she bow herself and travail ; for she pain come upon she .
and about the time of she death the woman that stand by she say unto she , fear not ; for thou hast bear a son .
but she answer not , neither do she regard it .
and she name the child ichabod , say , the glory be depart from israel : because the ark of god be take , and because of she father in law and she husband .
and she say , the glory be depart from israel : for the ark of god be take .
and the philistines take the ark of god , and bring it from ebenezer unto ashdod .
when the philistines take the ark of god , they bring it into the house of dagon , and set it by dagon .
and when they of ashdod arise early on the morrow , behold , dagon be fall upon he face to the earth before the ark of the lord .
and they take dagon , and set he in he place again .
and when they arise early on the morrow morning , behold , dagon be fall upon he face to the ground before the ark of the lord ; and the head of dagon and both the palm of he hand be cut off upon the threshold ; only the stump of dagon be leave to he .
therefore neither the priest of dagon , nor any that come into dagon 's house , tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day .
but the hand of the lord be heavy upon they of ashdod , and he destroy they , and smite they with emerod , even ashdod and the coast thereof .
and when the man of ashdod see that it be so , they say , the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with we : for he hand be sore upon we , and upon dagon we god .
they send therefore and gather all the lord of the philistines unto they , and say , what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel ?
and they answer , let the ark of the god of israel be carry about unto gath .
and they carry the ark of the god of israel about thither .
and it be so , that , after they have carry it about , the hand of the lord be against the city with a very great destruction : and he smite the man of the city , both small and great , and they have emerod in they secret part .
therefore they send the ark of god to ekron .
and it come to pass , as the ark of god come to ekron , that the ekronites cry out , say , they have bring about the ark of the god of israel to we , to slay we and we people .
so they send and gather together all the lord of the philistines , and say , send away the ark of the god of israel , and let it go again to he own place , that it slay we not , and we people : for there be a deadly destruction throughout all the city ; the hand of god be very heavy there .
and the man that die not be smite with the emerod : and the cry of the city go up to heaven .
and the ark of the lord be in the country of the philistines seven month .
and the philistines call for the priest and the diviner , say , what shall we do to the ark of the lord ? tell we wherewith we shall send it to he place .
and they say , if ye send away the ark of the god of israel , send it not empty ; but in any wise return he a trespass offering : then ye shall be heal , and it shall be know to you why he hand be not remove from you .
then say they , what shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to he ?
they answer , five golden emerod , and five golden mouse , accord to the number of the lord of the philistines : for one plague be on you all , and on you lord .
wherefore ye shall make image of you emerod , and image of you mouse that mar the land ; and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel : peradventure he will lighten he hand from off you , and from off you god , and from off you land .
wherefore then do ye harden you heart , as the egyptians and pharaoh harden they heart ? when he have work wonderfully among they , do they not let the people go , and they depart ?
now therefore make a new cart , and take two milch kine , on which there have come no yoke , and tie the kine to the cart , and bring they calf home from they :
and take the ark of the lord , and lay it upon the cart ; and put the jewel of gold , which ye return he for a trespass offering , in a coffer by the side thereof ; and send it away , that it may go .
and see , if it goeth up by the way of he own coast to bethshemesh , then he have do we this great evil : but if not , then we shall know that it be not he hand that smite we : it be a chance that happen to we .
and the man do so ; and take two milch kine , and tie they to the cart , and shut up they calf at home :
and they lay the ark of the lord upon the cart , and the coffer with the mouse of gold and the image of they emerod .
and the kine take the straight way to the way of bethshemesh , and go along the highway , low as they go , and turn not aside to the right hand or to the leave ; and the lord of the philistines go after they unto the border of bethshemesh .
and they of bethshemesh be reap they wheat harvest in the valley : and they lift up they eye , and see the ark , and rejoice to see it .
and the cart come into the field of joshua , a bethshemite , and stand there , where there be a great stone : and they cleave the wood of the cart , and offer the kine a burnt offering unto the lord .
and the levites take down the ark of the lord , and the coffer that be with it , wherein the jewel of gold be , and put they on the great stone : and the man of bethshemesh offer burnt offering and sacrifice sacrifice the same day unto the lord .
and when the five lord of the philistines have see it , they return to ekron the same day .
and these be the golden emerod which the philistines return for a trespass offering unto the lord ; for ashdod one , for gaza one , for askelon one , for gath one , for ekron one ;
and the golden mouse , accord to the number of all the city of the philistines belong to the five lord , both of fenced city , and of country village , even unto the great stone of abel , whereon they set down the ark of the lord : which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of joshua , the bethshemite .
and he smite the man of bethshemesh , because they have look into the ark of the lord , even he smite of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten man : and the people lament , because the lord have smite many of the people with a great slaughter .
and the man of bethshemesh say , who be able to stand before this holy lord god ? and to whom shall he go up from we ?
and they send messenger to the inhabitant of kirjathjearim , say , the philistine have bring again the ark of the lord ; come ye down , and fetch it up to you .
and the man of kirjathjearim come , and fetch up the ark of the lord , and bring it into the house of abinadab in the hill , and sanctify eleazar he son to keep the ark of the lord .
and it come to pass , while the ark abode in kirjathjearim , that the time be long ; for it be twenty year : and all the house of israel lament after the lord .
and samuel spake unto all the house of israel , say , if ye do return unto the lord with all you heart , then put away the strange god and ashtaroth from among you , and prepare you heart unto the lord , and serve he only : and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines .
then the child of israel do put away baalim and ashtaroth , and serve the lord only .
and samuel say , gather all israel to mizpeh , and i will pray for you unto the lord .
and they gather together to mizpeh , and draw water , and pour it out before the lord , and fast on that day , and say there , we have sin against the lord .
and samuel judge the child of israel in mizpeh .
and when the philistines hear that the child of israel be gather together to mizpeh , the lord of the philistines go up against israel .
and when the child of israel hear it , they be afraid of the philistines .
and the child of israel say to samuel , cease not to cry unto the lord we god for we , that he will save we out of the hand of the philistines .
and samuel take a suck lamb , and offer it for a burnt offering wholly unto the lord : and samuel cry unto the lord for israel ; and the lord hear he .
and as samuel be offer up the burnt offering , the philistines draw near to battle against israel : but the lord thunder with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines , and discomfited they ; and they be smite before israel .
and the man of israel go out of mizpeh , and pursue the philistines , and smite they , until they come under bethcar .
then samuel take a stone , and set it between mizpeh and shen , and call the name of it ebenezer , say , hitherto have the lord help we .
so the philistines be subdue , and they come no more into the coast of israel : and the hand of the lord be against the philistines all the day of samuel .
and the city which the philistines have take from israel be restore to israel , from ekron even unto gath ; and the coast thereof do israel deliver out of the hand of the philistines .
and there be peace between israel and the amorites .
and samuel judge israel all the day of he life .
and he go from year to year in circuit to bethel , and gilgal , and mizpeh , and judge israel in all those place .
and he return be to ramah ; for there be he house ; and there he judge israel ; and there he build a altar unto the lord .
and it come to pass , when samuel be old , that he make he son judge over israel .
now the name of he firstborn be joel ; and the name of he second , abiah : they be judge in beersheba .
and he son walk not in he way , but turn aside after lucre , and take bribe , and perverted judgment .
then all the elder of israel gather themselves together , and come to samuel unto ramah ,
and say unto he , behold , thou art old , and thy son walk not in thy way : now make we a king to judge we like all the nation .
but the thing displeased samuel , when they say , give we a king to judge we .
and samuel pray unto the lord .
and the lord say unto samuel , hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not reject thee , but they have reject i , that i should not reign over they .
accord to all the work which they have do since the day that i bring they up out of egypt even unto this day , wherewith they have forsake i , and serve other god , so do they also unto thee .
now therefore hearken unto they voice : howbeit yet protest solemnly unto they , and shew they the manner of the king that shall reign over they .
and samuel tell all the word of the lord unto the people that ask of he a king .
and he say , this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take you son , and appoint they for himself , for he chariot , and to be he horseman ; and some shall run before he chariot .
and he will appoint he captain over thousand , and captain over fifty ; and will set they to ear he ground , and to reap he harvest , and to make he instrument of war , and instrument of he chariot .
and he will take you daughter to be confectionary , and to be cook , and to be baker .
and he will take you field , and you vineyard , and you oliveyard , even the best of they , and give they to he servant .
and he will take the tenth of you seed , and of you vineyard , and give to he officer , and to he servant .
and he will take you manservant , and you maidservant , and you goodliest young man , and you ass , and put they to he work .
he will take the tenth of you sheep : and ye shall be he servant .
and ye shall cry out in that day because of you king which ye shall have choose you ; and the lord will not hear you in that day .
nevertheless the people refuse to obey the voice of samuel ; and they say , nay ; but we will have a king over we ;
that we also may be like all the nation ; and that we king may judge we , and go out before we , and fight we battle .
and samuel hear all the word of the people , and he rehearse they in the ear of the lord .
and the lord say to samuel , hearken unto they voice , and make they a king .
and samuel say unto the man of israel , go ye every man unto he city .
now there be a man of benjamin , whose name be kish , the son of abiel , the son of zeror , the son of bechorath , the son of aphiah , a benjamite , a mighty man of power .
and he have a son , whose name be saul , a choice young man , and a goodly : and there be not among the child of israel a goodlier person than he : from he shoulder and upward he be higher than any of the people .
and the ass of kish saul 's father be lose .
and kish say to saul he son , take now one of the servant with thee , and arise , go seek the ass .
and he pass through mount ephraim , and pass through the land of shalisha , but they find they not : then they pass through the land of shalim , and there they be not : and he pass through the land of the benjamites , but they find they not .
and when they be come to the land of zuph , saul say to he servant that be with he , come , and let we return ; lest my father leave care for the ass , and take think for we .
and he say unto he , behold now , there be in this city a man of god , and he be a honourable man ; all that he saith cometh surely to pass : now let we go thither ; peradventure he can shew we we way that we should go .
then say saul to he servant , but , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread be spend in we vessel , and there be not a present to bring to the man of god : what have we ?
and the servant answer saul again , and say , behold , i have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver : that will i give to the man of god , to tell we we way .
( beforetime in israel , when a man go to enquire of god , thus he speak , come , and let we go to the seer : for he that be now call a prophet be beforetime call a seer . )
then say saul to he servant , well say ; come , let we go .
so they go unto the city where the man of god be .
and as they go up the hill to the city , they find young maiden go out to draw water , and say unto they , be the seer here ?
and they answer they , and say , he be ; behold , he be before you : make haste now , for he come to day to the city ; for there be a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place :
as soon as ye be come into the city , ye shall straightway find he , before he go up to the high place to eat : for the people will not eat until he come , because he doth bless the sacrifice ; and afterwards they eat that be bid .
now therefore get you up ; for about this time ye shall find he .
and they go up into the city : and when they be come into the city , behold , samuel come out against they , for to go up to the high place .
now the lord have tell samuel in he ear a day before saul come , say ,
to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out of the land of benjamin , and thou shalt anoint he to be captain over my people israel , that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistines : for i have look upon my people , because they cry be come unto i .
and when samuel see saul , the lord say unto he , behold the man whom i speak to thee of ! this same shall reign over my people .
then saul draw near to samuel in the gate , and say , tell i , i pray thee , where the seer 's house be .
and samuel answer saul , and say , i be the seer : go up before i unto the high place ; for ye shall eat with i to day , and to morrow i will let thee go , and will tell thee all that be in thine heart .
and as for thine ass that be lose three day ago , set not thy mind on they ; for they be find .
and on whom be all the desire of israel ?
be it not on thee , and on all thy father 's house ?
and saul answer and say , be not i a benjamite , of the smallest of the tribe of israel ? and my family the least of all the family of the tribe of benjamin ? wherefore then speakest thou so to i ?
and samuel take saul and he servant , and bring they into the parlour , and make they sit in the chiefest place among they that be bid , which be about thirty person .
and samuel say unto the cook , bring the portion which i give thee , of which i say unto thee , set it by thee .
and the cook take up the shoulder , and that which be upon it , and set it before saul .
and samuel say , behold that which be leave ! set it before thee , and eat : for unto this time have it be keep for thee since i say , i have invite the people .
so saul do eat with samuel that day .
and when they be come down from the high place into the city , samuel communed with saul upon the top of the house .
and they arise early : and it come to pass about the spring of the day , that samuel call saul to the top of the house , say , up , that i may send thee away .
and saul arise , and they go out both of they , he and samuel , abroad .
and as they be go down to the end of the city , samuel say to saul , bid the servant pass on before we , ( and he pass on ) , but stand thou still a while , that i may shew thee the word of god .
then samuel take a vial of oil , and pour it upon he head , and kiss he , and say , be it not because the lord have anointed thee to be captain over he inheritance ?
when thou art depart from i to day , then thou shalt find two man by rachel 's sepulchre in the border of benjamin at zelzah ; and they will say unto thee , the ass which thou wentest to seek be find : and , lo , thy father have leave the care of the ass , and sorroweth for you , say , what shall i do for my son ?
then shalt thou go on forward from thence , and thou shalt come to the plain of tabor , and there shall meet thee three man go up to god to bethel , one carry three kid , and another carry three loaf of bread , and another carry a bottle of wine :
and they will salute thee , and give thee two loaf of bread ; which thou shalt receive of they hand .
after that thou shalt come to the hill of god , where be the garrison of the philistines : and it shall come to pass , when thou art come thither to the city , that thou shalt meet a company of prophet come down from the high place with a psaltery , and a tabret , and a pipe , and a harp , before they ; and they shall prophesy :
and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee , and thou shalt prophesy with they , and shalt be turn into another man .
and let it be , when these sign be come unto thee , that thou do as occasion serve thee ; for god be with thee .
and thou shalt go down before i to gilgal ; and , behold , i will come down unto thee , to offer burnt offering , and to sacrifice sacrifice of peace offering : seven day shalt thou tarry , till i come to thee , and shew thee what thou shalt do .
and it be so , that when he have turn he back to go from samuel , god give he another heart : and all those sign come to pass that day .
and when they come thither to the hill , behold , a company of prophet meet he ; and the spirit of god come upon he , and he prophesy among they .
and it come to pass , when all that know he beforetime saw that , behold , he prophesy among the prophet , then the people say one to another , what be this that be come unto the son of kish ?
be saul also among the prophet ?
and one of the same place answer and say , but who be they father ?
therefore it become a proverb , be saul also among the prophet ?
and when he have make a end of prophesy , he come to the high place .
and saul 's uncle say unto he and to he servant , whither go ye ?
and he say , to seek the ass : and when we see that they be no where , we come to samuel .
and saul 's uncle say , tell i , i pray thee , what samuel say unto you .
and saul say unto he uncle , he tell we plainly that the ass be find .
but of the matter of the kingdom , whereof samuel spake , he tell he not .
and samuel call the people together unto the lord to mizpeh ;
and say unto the child of israel , thus saith the lord god of israel , i bring up israel out of egypt , and deliver you out of the hand of the egyptians , and out of the hand of all kingdom , and of they that oppress you :
and ye have this day reject you god , who himself save you out of all you adversity and you tribulation ; and ye have say unto he , nay , but set a king over we .
now therefore present yourselve before the lord by you tribe , and by you thousand .
and when samuel have cause all the tribe of israel to come near , the tribe of benjamin be take .
when he have cause the tribe of benjamin to come near by they family , the family of matri be take , and saul the son of kish be take : and when they seek he , he could not be find .
therefore they enquire of the lord further , if the man should yet come thither .
and the lord answer , behold , he have hide himself among the stuff .
and they run and fetch he thence : and when he stand among the people , he be higher than any of the people from he shoulder and upward .
and samuel say to all the people , see ye he whom the lord have choose , that there be none like he among all the people ?
and all the people shout , and say , god save the king .
then samuel tell the people the manner of the kingdom , and write it in a book , and lay it up before the lord .
and samuel send all the people away , every man to he house .
and saul also go home to gibeah ; and there go with he a band of man , whose heart god have touch .
but the child of belial say , how shall this man save we ?
and they despise he , and bring he no present .
but he hold he peace .
then nahash the ammonite come up , and encamp against jabeshgilead : and all the man of jabesh say unto nahash , make a covenant with we , and we will serve thee .
and nahash the ammonite answer they , on this condition will i make a covenant with you , that i may thrust out all you right eye , and lay it for a reproach upon all israel .
and the elder of jabesh say unto he , give we seven day ' respite , that we may send messenger unto all the coast of israel : and then , if there be no man to save we , we will come out to thee .
then come the messenger to gibeah of saul , and tell the tiding in the ear of the people : and all the people lift up they voice , and weep .
and , behold , saul come after the herd out of the field ; and saul say , what aileth the people that they weep ?
and they tell he the tiding of the man of jabesh .
and the spirit of god come upon saul when he hear those tiding , and he anger be kindle greatly .
and he take a yoke of ox , and hew they in piece , and send they throughout all the coast of israel by the hand of messenger , say , whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel , so shall it be do unto he ox .
and the fear of the lord fall on the people , and they come out with one consent .
and when he number they in bezek , the child of israel be three hundred thousand , and the man of judah thirty thousand .
and they say unto the messenger that come , thus shall ye say unto the man of jabeshgilead , to morrow , by that time the sun be hot , ye shall have help .
and the messenger come and shew it to the man of jabesh ; and they be glad .
therefore the man of jabesh say , to morrow we will come out unto you , and ye shall do with we all that seemeth good unto you .
and it be so on the morrow , that saul put the people in three company ; and they come into the midst of the host in the morning watch , and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day : and it come to pass , that they which remain be scatter , so that two of they be not leave together .
and the people say unto samuel , who be he that say , shall saul reign over we ? bring the man , that we may put they to death .
and saul say , there shall not a man be put to death this day : for to day the lord have work salvation in israel .
then say samuel to the people , come , and let we go to gilgal , and renew the kingdom there .
and all the people go to gilgal ; and there they make saul king before the lord in gilgal ; and there they sacrifice sacrifice of peace offering before the lord ; and there saul and all the man of israel rejoice greatly .
and samuel say unto all israel , behold , i have hearken unto you voice in all that ye say unto i , and have make a king over you .
and now , behold , the king walketh before you : and i be old and grayhead ; and , behold , my son be with you : and i have walk before you from my childhood unto this day .
behold , here i be : witness against i before the lord , and before he anointed : whose ox have i take ? or whose ass have i take ? or whom have i defraud ? whom have i oppress ? or of whose hand have i receive any bribe to blind mine eye therewith ? and i will restore it you .
and they say , thou hast not defraud we , nor oppressed we , neither hast thou take ought of any man 's hand .
and he say unto they , the lord be witness against you , and he anointed be witness this day , that ye have not find ought in my hand .
and they answer , he be witness .
and samuel say unto the people , it be the lord that advance moses and aaron , and that bring you father up out of the land of egypt .
now therefore stand still , that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous act of the lord , which he do to you and to you father .
when jacob be come into egypt , and you father cry unto the lord , then the lord send moses and aaron , which bring forth you father out of egypt , and make they dwell in this place .
and when they forgat the lord they god , he sell they into the hand of sisera , captain of the host of hazor , and into the hand of the philistines , and into the hand of the king of moab , and they fight against they .
and they cry unto the lord , and say , we have sin , because we have forsake the lord , and have serve baalim and ashtaroth : but now deliver we out of the hand of we enemy , and we will serve thee .
and the lord send jerubbaal , and bedan , and jephthah , and samuel , and deliver you out of the hand of you enemy on every side , and ye dwell safe .
and when ye see that nahash the king of the child of ammon come against you , ye say unto i , nay ; but a king shall reign over we : when the lord you god be you king .
now therefore behold the king whom ye have choose , and whom ye have desire ! and , behold , the lord have set a king over you .
if ye will fear the lord , and serve he , and obey he voice , and not rebel against the commandment of the lord , then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue follow the lord you god :
but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord , but rebel against the commandment of the lord , then shall the hand of the lord be against you , as it be against you father .
now therefore stand and see this great thing , which the lord will do before you eye .
be it not wheat harvest to day ?
i will call unto the lord , and he shall send thunder and rain ; that ye may perceive and see that you wickedness be great , which ye have do in the sight of the lord , in ask you a king .
so samuel call unto the lord ; and the lord send thunder and rain that day : and all the people greatly fear the lord and samuel .
and all the people say unto samuel , pray for thy servant unto the lord thy god , that we die not : for we have add unto all we sin this evil , to ask we a king .
and samuel say unto the people , fear not : ye have do all this wickedness : yet turn not aside from follow the lord , but serve the lord with all you heart ;
and turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after vain thing , which can not profit nor deliver ; for they be vain .
for the lord will not forsake he people for he great name 's sake : because it have pleased the lord to make you he people .
moreover as for i , god forbid that i should sin against the lord in cease to pray for you : but i will teach you the good and the right way :
only fear the lord , and serve he in truth with all you heart : for consider how great thing he have do for you .
but if ye shall still do wickedly , ye shall be consume , both ye and you king .
saul reign one year ; and when he have reign two year over israel ,
saul choose he three thousand man of israel ; whereof two thousand be with saul in michmash and in mount bethel , and a thousand be with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin : and the rest of the people he send every man to he tent .
and jonathan smite the garrison of the philistine that be in geba , and the philistines hear of it .
and saul blow the trumpet throughout all the land , say , let the hebrews hear .
and all israel hear say that saul have smite a garrison of the philistines , and that israel also be have in abomination with the philistines .
and the people be call together after saul to gilgal .
and the philistines gather themselves together to fight with israel , thirty thousand chariot , and six thousand horseman , and people as the sand which be on the sea shore in multitude : and they come up , and pitch in michmash , eastward from bethaven .
when the man of israel see that they be in a strait , ( for the people be distressed , ) then the people do hide themselves in cave , and in thicket , and in rock , and in high place , and in pit .
and some of the hebrews go over jordan to the land of gad and gilead .
as for saul , he be yet in gilgal , and all the people follow he tremble .
and he tarry seven day , accord to the set time that samuel have appoint : but samuel come not to gilgal ; and the people be scatter from he .
and saul say , bring hither a burnt offering to i , and peace offering .
and he offer the burnt offering .
and it come to pass , that as soon as he have make a end of offer the burnt offering , behold , samuel come ; and saul go out to meet he , that he might salute he .
and samuel say , what hast thou do ?
and saul say , because i see that the people be scatter from i , and that thou camest not within the day appoint , and that the philistines gather themselves together at michmash ;
therefore say i , the philistine will come down now upon i to gilgal , and i have not make supplication unto the lord : i force myself therefore , and offer a burnt offering .
and samuel say to saul , thou hast do foolishly : thou hast not keep the commandment of the lord thy god , which he command thee : for now would the lord have establish thy kingdom upon israel for ever .
but now thy kingdom shall not continue : the lord have seek he a man after he own heart , and the lord have command he to be captain over he people , because thou hast not keep that which the lord command thee .
and samuel arise , and gat he up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin .
and saul number the people that be present with he , about six hundred man .
and saul , and jonathan he son , and the people that be present with they , abode in gibeah of benjamin : but the philistines encamp in michmash .
and the spoiler come out of the camp of the philistines in three company : one company turn unto the way that leadeth to ophrah , unto the land of shual :
and another company turn the way to bethhoron : and another company turn to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness .
now there be no smith find throughout all the land of israel : for the philistines say , lest the hebrews make they sword or spear :
but all the israelites go down to the philistines , to sharpen every man he share , and he coulter , and he axe , and he mattock .
yet they have a file for the mattock , and for the coulter , and for the fork , and for the axis , and to sharpen the goad .
so it come to pass in the day of battle , that there be neither sword nor spear find in the hand of any of the people that be with saul and jonathan : but with saul and with jonathan he son be there find .
and the garrison of the philistines go out to the passage of michmash .
now it come to pass upon a day , that jonathan the son of saul say unto the young man that bare he armour , come , and let we go over to the philistines ' garrison , that be on the other side .
but he tell not he father .
and saul tarry in the uttermost part of gibeah under a pomegranate tree which be in migron : and the people that be with he be about six hundred man ;
and ahiah , the son of ahitub , ichabod 's brother , the son of phinehas , the son of eli , the lord 's priest in shiloh , wear a ephod .
and the people know not that jonathan be go .
and between the passage , by which jonathan seek to go over unto the philistines ' garrison , there be a sharp rock on the one side , and a sharp rock on the other side : and the name of the one be bozez , and the name of the other seneh .
the forefront of the one be situate northward over against michmash , and the other southward over against gibeah .
and jonathan say to the young man that bare he armour , come , and let we go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised : it may be that the lord will work for we : for there be no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few .
and he armourbearer say unto he , do all that be in thine heart : turn thee ; behold , i be with thee accord to thy heart .
then say jonathan , behold , we will pass over unto these man , and we will discover ourselves unto they .
if they say thus unto we , tarry until we come to you ; then we will stand still in we place , and will not go up unto they .
but if they say thus , come up unto we ; then we will go up : for the lord have deliver they into we hand : and this shall be a sign unto we .
and both of they discover themselves unto the garrison of the philistines : and the philistines say , behold , the hebrews come forth out of the hole where they have hide themselves .
and the man of the garrison answer jonathan and he armourbearer , and say , come up to we , and we will shew you a thing .
and jonathan say unto he armourbearer , come up after i : for the lord have deliver they into the hand of israel .
and jonathan climb up upon he hand and upon he foot , and he armourbearer after he : and they fall before jonathan ; and he armourbearer slew after he .
and that first slaughter , which jonathan and he armourbearer make , be about twenty man , within as it be a half acre of land , which a yoke of ox might plow .
and there be tremble in the host , in the field , and among all the people : the garrison , and the spoiler , they also tremble , and the earth quake : so it be a very great tremble .
and the watchman of saul in gibeah of benjamin look ; and , behold , the multitude melt away , and they go on beat down one another .
then say saul unto the people that be with he , number now , and see who be go from we .
and when they have number , behold , jonathan and he armourbearer be not there .
and saul say unto ahiah , bring hither the ark of god .
for the ark of god be at that time with the child of israel .
and it come to pass , while saul talk unto the priest , that the noise that be in the host of the philistines go on and increase : and saul say unto the priest , withdraw thine hand .
and saul and all the people that be with he assemble themselves , and they come to the battle : and , behold , every man 's sword be against he fellow , and there be a very great discomfiture .
moreover the hebrews that be with the philistines before that time , which go up with they into the camp from the country round about , even they also turn to be with the israelites that be with saul and jonathan .
likewise all the man of israel which have hide themselves in mount ephraim , when they hear that the philistines flee , even they also follow hard after they in the battle .
so the lord save israel that day : and the battle pass over unto bethaven .
and the man of israel be distressed that day : for saul have adjure the people , say , cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening , that i may be avenge on mine enemy .
so none of the people taste any food .
and all they of the land come to a wood ; and there be honey upon the ground .
and when the people be come into the wood , behold , the honey drop ; but no man put he hand to he mouth : for the people fear the oath .
but jonathan hear not when he father charge the people with the oath : wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that be in he hand , and dip it in a honeycomb , and put he hand to he mouth ; and he eye be enlighten .
then answer one of the people , and say , thy father straitly charge the people with a oath , say , cursed be the man that eateth any food this day .
and the people be faint .
then say jonathan , my father have trouble the land : see , i pray you , how mine eye have be enlighten , because i taste a little of this honey .
how much more , if haply the people have eat freely to day of the spoil of they enemy which they find ? for have there not be now a much greater slaughter among the philistines ?
and they smite the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon : and the people be very faint .
and the people fly upon the spoil , and take sheep , and ox , and calf , and slew they on the ground : and the people do eat they with the blood .
then they tell saul , say , behold , the people sin against the lord , in that they eat with the blood .
and he say , ye have transgress : roll a great stone unto i this day .
and saul say , disperse yourselve among the people , and say unto they , bring i hither every man he ox , and every man he sheep , and slay they here , and eat ; and sin not against the lord in eat with the blood .
and all the people bring every man he ox with he that night , and slew they there .
and saul build a altar unto the lord : the same be the first altar that he build unto the lord .
and saul say , let we go down after the philistine by night , and spoil they until the morning light , and let we not leave a man of they .
and they say , do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee .
then say the priest , let we draw near hither unto god .
and saul ask counsel of god , shall i go down after the philistines ? wilt thou deliver they into the hand of israel ?
but he answer he not that day .
and saul say , draw ye near hither , all the chief of the people : and know and see wherein this sin have be this day .
for , as the lord liveth , which saveth israel , though it be in jonathan my son , he shall surely die .
but there be not a man among all the people that answer he .
then say he unto all israel , be ye on one side , and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side .
and the people say unto saul , do what seemeth good unto thee .
therefore saul say unto the lord god of israel , give a perfect lot .
and saul and jonathan be take : but the people escape .
and saul say , cast lot between i and jonathan my son .
and jonathan be take .
then saul say to jonathan , tell i what thou hast do .
and jonathan tell he , and say , i do but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that be in mine hand , and , lo , i must die .
and saul answer , god do so and more also : for thou shalt surely die , jonathan .
and the people say unto saul , shall jonathan die , who have work this great salvation in israel ?
god forbid : as the lord liveth , there shall not one hair of he head fall to the ground ; for he have work with god this day .
so the people rescue jonathan , that he die not .
then saul go up from follow the philistines : and the philistines go to they own place .
so saul take the kingdom over israel , and fight against all he enemy on every side , against moab , and against the child of ammon , and against edom , and against the king of zobah , and against the philistines : and whithersoever he turn himself , he vex they .
and he gather a host , and smite the amalekites , and deliver israel out of the hand of they that spoil they .
now the son of saul be jonathan , and ishui , and melchishua : and the name of he two daughter be these ; the name of the firstborn merab , and the name of the younger michal :
and the name of saul 's wife be ahinoam , the daughter of ahimaaz : and the name of the captain of he host be abner , the son of ner , saul 's uncle .
and kish be the father of saul ; and ner the father of abner be the son of abiel .
and there be sore war against the philistines all the day of saul : and when saul see any strong man , or any valiant man , he take he unto he .
samuel also say unto saul , the lord send i to anoint thee to be king over he people , over israel : now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the word of the lord .
thus saith the lord of host , i remember that which amalek do to israel , how he lay wait for he in the way , when he come up from egypt .
now go and smite amalek , and utterly destroy all that they have , and spare they not ; but slay both man and woman , infant and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass .
and saul gather the people together , and number they in telaim , two hundred thousand footman , and ten thousand man of judah .
and saul come to a city of amalek , and lay wait in the valley .
and saul say unto the kenites , go , depart , get you down from among the amalekites , lest i destroy you with they : for ye shew kindness to all the child of israel , when they come up out of egypt .
so the kenites depart from among the amalekites .
and saul smite the amalekites from havilah until thou comest to shur , that be over against egypt .
and he take agag the king of the amalekites alive , and utterly destroy all the people with the edge of the sword .
but saul and the people spare agag , and the best of the sheep , and of the ox , and of the fatling , and the lamb , and all that be good , and would not utterly destroy they : but every thing that be vile and refuse , that they destroy utterly .
then come the word of the lord unto samuel , say ,
it repenteth i that i have set up saul to be king : for he be turn back from follow i , and have not perform my commandment .
and it grieve samuel ; and he cry unto the lord all night .
and when samuel rise early to meet saul in the morning , it be tell samuel , say , saul come to carmel , and , behold , he set he up a place , and be go about , and pass on , and go down to gilgal .
and samuel come to saul : and saul say unto he , bless be thou of the lord : i have perform the commandment of the lord .
and samuel say , what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ear , and the lowing of the ox which i hear ?
and saul say , they have bring they from the amalekites : for the people spare the best of the sheep and of the ox , to sacrifice unto the lord thy god ; and the rest we have utterly destroy .
then samuel say unto saul , stay , and i will tell thee what the lord have say to i this night .
and he say unto he , say on .
and samuel say , when thou wast little in thine own sight , wast thou not make the head of the tribe of israel , and the lord anoint thee king over israel ?
and the lord send thee on a journey , and say , go and utterly destroy the sinner the amalekites , and fight against they until they be consume .
wherefore then do thou not obey the voice of the lord , but didst fly upon the spoil , and didst evil in the sight of the lord ?
and saul say unto samuel , yea , i have obey the voice of the lord , and have go the way which the lord send i , and have bring agag the king of amalek , and have utterly destroy the amalekites .
but the people take of the spoil , sheep and ox , the chief of the thing which should have be utterly destroy , to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal .
and samuel say , have the lord as great delight in burnt offering and sacrifice , as in obey the voice of the lord ?
behold , to obey be better than sacrifice , and to hearken than the fat of ram .
for rebellion be as the sin of witchcraft , and stubbornness be as iniquity and idolatry .
because thou hast reject the word of the lord , he have also reject thee from be king .
and saul say unto samuel , i have sin : for i have transgress the commandment of the lord , and thy word : because i fear the people , and obey they voice .
now therefore , i pray thee , pardon my sin , and turn again with i , that i may worship the lord .
and samuel say unto saul , i will not return with thee : for thou hast reject the word of the lord , and the lord have reject thee from be king over israel .
and as samuel turn about to go away , he lay hold upon the skirt of he mantle , and it rent .
and samuel say unto he , the lord have rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day , and have give it to a neighbour of thine , that be better than thou .
and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent : for he be not a man , that he should repent .
then he say , i have sin : yet honour i now , i pray thee , before the elder of my people , and before israel , and turn again with i , that i may worship the lord thy god .
so samuel turn again after saul ; and saul worship the lord .
then say samuel , bring ye hither to i agag the king of the amalekites .
and agag come unto he delicately .
and agag say , surely the bitterness of death be past .
and samuel say , as thy sword have make woman childless , so shall thy mother be childless among woman .
and samuel hew agag in piece before the lord in gilgal .
then samuel go to ramah ; and saul go up to he house to gibeah of saul .
and samuel come no more to see saul until the day of he death : nevertheless samuel mourn for saul : and the lord repent that he have make saul king over israel .
and the lord say unto samuel , how long wilt thou mourn for saul , see i have reject he from reign over israel ? fill thine horn with oil , and go , i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite : for i have provide i a king among he son .
and samuel say , how can i go ? if saul hear it , he will kill i .
and the lord say , take a heifer with thee , and say , i be come to sacrifice to the lord .
and call jesse to the sacrifice , and i will shew thee what thou shalt do : and thou shalt anoint unto i he whom i name unto thee .
and samuel do that which the lord spake , and come to bethlehem .
and the elder of the town tremble at he come , and say , comest thou peaceably ?
and he say , peaceably : i be come to sacrifice unto the lord : sanctify yourselve , and come with i to the sacrifice .
and he sanctify jesse and he son , and call they to the sacrifice .
and it come to pass , when they be come , that he look on eliab , and say , surely the lord 's anointed be before he .
but the lord say unto samuel , look not on he countenance , or on the height of he stature ; because i have refuse he : for the lord seeth not as man seeth ; for man looketh on the outward appearance , but the lord looketh on the heart .
then jesse call abinadab , and make he pass before samuel .
and he say , neither have the lord choose this .
then jesse make shammah to pass by .
and he say , neither have the lord choose this .
again , jesse make seven of he son to pass before samuel .
and samuel say unto jesse , the lord have not choose these .
and samuel say unto jesse , be here all thy child ?
and he say , there remaineth yet the youngest , and , behold , he keepeth the sheep .
and samuel say unto jesse , send and fetch he : for we will not sit down till he come hither .
and he send , and bring he in .
now he be ruddy , and withal of a beautiful countenance , and goodly to look to .
and the lord say , arise , anoint he : for this be he .
then samuel take the horn of oil , and anoint he in the midst of he brethren : and the spirit of the lord come upon david from that day forward .
so samuel rise up , and go to ramah .
but the spirit of the lord depart from saul , and a evil spirit from the lord trouble he .
and saul 's servant say unto he , behold now , a evil spirit from god troubleth thee .
let we lord now command thy servant , which be before thee , to seek out a man , who be a cunning player on a harp : and it shall come to pass , when the evil spirit from god be upon thee , that he shall play with he hand , and thou shalt be well .
and saul say unto he servant , provide i now a man that can play well , and bring he to i .
then answer one of the servant , and say , behold , i have see a son of jesse the bethlehemite , that be cunning in play , and a mighty valiant man , and a man of war , and prudent in matter , and a comely person , and the lord be with he .
wherefore saul send messenger unto jesse , and say , send i david thy son , which be with the sheep .
and jesse take a ass laden with bread , and a bottle of wine , and a kid , and send they by david he son unto saul .
and david come to saul , and stand before he : and he love he greatly ; and he become he armourbearer .
and saul send to jesse , say , let david , i pray thee , stand before i ; for he have find favour in my sight .
and it come to pass , when the evil spirit from god be upon saul , that david take a harp , and play with he hand : so saul be refresh , and be well , and the evil spirit depart from he .
now the philistines gather together they army to battle , and be gather together at shochoh , which belongeth to judah , and pitch between shochoh and azekah , in ephesdammim .
and saul and the man of israel be gather together , and pitch by the valley of elah , and set the battle in array against the philistines .
and the philistines stand on a mountain on the one side , and israel stand on a mountain on the other side : and there be a valley between they .
and there go out a champion out of the camp of the philistines , name goliath , of gath , whose height be six cubit and a span .
and he have a helmet of brass upon he head , and he be arm with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat be five thousand shekel of brass .
and he have greave of brass upon he leg , and a target of brass between he shoulder .
and the staff of he spear be like a weaver 's beam ; and he spear 's head weigh six hundred shekel of iron : and one bear a shield go before he .
and he stand and cry unto the army of israel , and say unto they , why be ye come out to set you battle in array ? be not i a philistine , and ye servant to saul ? choose you a man for you , and let he come down to i .
if he be able to fight with i , and to kill i , then will we be you servant : but if i prevail against he , and kill he , then shall ye be we servant , and serve we .
and the philistine say , i defy the army of israel this day ; give i a man , that we may fight together .
when saul and all israel hear those word of the philistine , they be dismayed , and greatly afraid .
now david be the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah , whose name be jesse ; and he have eight son : and the man go among man for a old man in the day of saul .
and the three eldest son of jesse go and follow saul to the battle : and the name of he three son that go to the battle be eliab the firstborn , and next unto he abinadab , and the third shammah .
and david be the youngest : and the three eldest follow saul .
but david go and return from saul to feed he father 's sheep at bethlehem .
and the philistine draw near morning and evening , and present himself forty day .
and jesse say unto david he son , take now for thy brethren a ephah of this parched corn , and these ten loaf , and run to the camp to thy brethren .
and carry these ten cheese unto the captain of they thousand , and look how thy brethren fare , and take they pledge .
now saul , and they , and all the man of israel , be in the valley of elah , fight with the philistines .
and david rise up early in the morning , and leave the sheep with a keeper , and take , and go , as jesse have command he ; and he come to the trench , as the host be go forth to the fight , and shout for the battle .
for israel and the philistines have put the battle in array , army against army .
and david leave he carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage , and run into the army , and come and salute he brethren .
and as he talk with they , behold , there come up the champion , the philistine of gath , goliath by name , out of the army of the philistines , and spake accord to the same word : and david hear they .
and all the man of israel , when they see the man , flee from he , and be sore afraid .
and the man of israel say , have ye see this man that be come up ? surely to defy israel be he come up : and it shall be , that the man who killeth he , the king will enrich he with great riches , and will give he he daughter , and make he father 's house free in israel .
and david spake to the man that stand by he , say , what shall be do to the man that killeth this philistine , and taketh away the reproach from israel ? for who be this uncircumcised philistine , that he should defy the army of the living god ?
and the people answer he after this manner , say , so shall it be do to the man that killeth he .
and eliab he eldest brother hear when he speak unto the man ; and eliab 's anger be kindle against david , and he say , why camest thou down hither ? and with whom hast thou leave those few sheep in the wilderness ?
i know thy pride , and the naughtiness of thine heart ; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle .
and david say , what have i now do ?
be there not a cause ?
and he turn from he toward another , and spake after the same manner : and the people answer he again after the former manner .
and when the word be hear which david spake , they rehearse they before saul : and he send for he .
and david say to saul , let no man 's heart fail because of he ; thy servant will go and fight with this philistine .
and saul say to david , thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with he : for thou art but a youth , and he a man of war from he youth .
and david say unto saul , thy servant keep he father 's sheep , and there come a lion , and a bear , and take a lamb out of the flock :
and i go out after he , and smite he , and deliver it out of he mouth : and when he arise against i , i catch he by he beard , and smite he , and slew he .
thy servant slew both the lion and the bear : and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of they , see he have defy the army of the living god .
david say moreover , the lord that deliver i out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver i out of the hand of this philistine .
and saul say unto david , go , and the lord be with thee .
and saul armed david with he armour , and he put a helmet of brass upon he head ; also he arm he with a coat of mail .
and david gird he sword upon he armour , and he assay to go ; for he have not prove it .
and david say unto saul , i can not go with these ; for i have not prove they .
and david put they off he .
and he take he staff in he hand , and choose he five smooth stone out of the brook , and put they in a shepherd 's bag which he have , even in a scrip ; and he sling be in he hand : and he draw near to the philistine .
and the philistine come on and draw near unto david ; and the man that bare the shield go before he .
and when the philistine look about , and see david , he disdain he : for he be but a youth , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance .
and the philistine say unto david , be i a dog , that thou comest to i with stave ?
and the philistine curse david by he god .
and the philistine say to david , come to i , and i will give thy flesh unto the fowl of the air , and to the beast of the field .
then say david to the philistine , thou comest to i with a sword , and with a spear , and with a shield : but i come to thee in the name of the lord of host , the god of the army of israel , whom thou hast defy .
this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand ; and i will smite thee , and take thine head from thee ; and i will give the carcase of the host of the philistine this day unto the fowl of the air , and to the wild beast of the earth ; that all the earth may know that there be a god in israel .
and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear : for the battle be the lord 's , and he will give you into we hand .
and it come to pass , when the philistine arise , and come , and draw nigh to meet david , that david hasten , and run toward the army to meet the philistine .
and david put he hand in he bag , and take thence a stone , and slang it , and smite the philistine in he forehead , that the stone sink into he forehead ; and he fall upon he face to the earth .
so david prevail over the philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smite the philistine , and slew he ; but there be no sword in the hand of david .
therefore david run , and stand upon the philistine , and take he sword , and draw it out of the sheath thereof , and slew he , and cut off he head therewith .
and when the philistines see they champion be dead , they flee .
and the man of israel and of judah arise , and shout , and pursue the philistines , until thou come to the valley , and to the gate of ekron .
and the wound of the philistines fall down by the way to shaaraim , even unto gath , and unto ekron .
and the child of israel return from chase after the philistines , and they spoil they tent .
and david take the head of the philistine , and bring it to jerusalem ; but he put he armour in he tent .
and when saul see david go forth against the philistine , he say unto abner , the captain of the host , abner , whose son be this youth ?
and abner say , as thy soul liveth , o king , i can not tell .
and the king say , enquire thou whose son the stripling be .
and as david return from the slaughter of the philistine , abner take he , and bring he before saul with the head of the philistine in he hand .
and saul say to he , whose son art thou , thou young man ?
and david answer , i be the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite .
and it come to pass , when he have make a end of speak unto saul , that the soul of jonathan be knit with the soul of david , and jonathan love he as he own soul .
and saul take he that day , and would let he go no more home to he father 's house .
then jonathan and david make a covenant , because he love he as he own soul .
and jonathan strip himself of the robe that be upon he , and give it to david , and he garment , even to he sword , and to he bow , and to he girdle .
and david go out whithersoever saul send he , and behave himself wisely : and saul set he over the man of war , and he be accept in the sight of all the people , and also in the sight of saul 's servant .
and it come to pass as they come , when david be return from the slaughter of the philistine , that the woman come out of all city of israel , singing and dancing , to meet king saul , with tabret , with joy , and with instrument of musick .
and the woman answer one another as they play , and say , saul have slay he thousand , and david he ten thousand .
and saul be very wroth , and the say displeased he ; and he say , they have ascribe unto david ten thousand , and to i they have ascribe but thousand : and what can he have more but the kingdom ?
and saul eye david from that day and forward .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that the evil spirit from god come upon saul , and he prophesy in the midst of the house : and david play with he hand , as at other time : and there be a javelin in saul 's hand .
and saul cast the javelin ; for he say , i will smite david even to the wall with it .
and david avoid out of he presence twice .
and saul be afraid of david , because the lord be with he , and be depart from saul .
therefore saul remove he from he , and make he he captain over a thousand ; and he go out and come in before the people .
and david behave himself wisely in all he way ; and the lord be with he .
wherefore when saul see that he behave himself very wisely , he be afraid of he .
but all israel and judah love david , because he go out and come in before they .
and saul say to david , behold my elder daughter merab , she will i give thee to wife : only be thou valiant for i , and fight the lord 's battle .
for saul say , let not mine hand be upon he , but let the hand of the philistines be upon he .
and david say unto saul , who be i ? and what be my life , or my father 's family in israel , that i should be son in law to the king ?
but it come to pass at the time when merab saul 's daughter should have be give to david , that she be give unto adriel the meholathite to wife .
and michal saul 's daughter love david : and they tell saul , and the thing pleased he .
and saul say , i will give he she , that she may be a snare to he , and that the hand of the philistines may be against he .
wherefore saul say to david , thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain .
and saul command he servant , say , commune with david secretly , and say , behold , the king have delight in thee , and all he servant love thee : now therefore be the king 's son in law .
and saul 's servant speak those word in the ear of david .
and david say , seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king 's son in law , see that i be a poor man , and lightly esteem ?
and the servant of saul tell he , say , on this manner spake david .
and saul say , thus shall ye say to david , the king desireth not any dowry , but a hundred foreskin of the philistines , to be avenge of the king 's enemy .
but saul think to make david fall by the hand of the philistines .
and when he servant tell david these word , it please david well to be the king 's son in law : and the day be not expire .
wherefore david arise and go , he and he man , and slew of the philistines two hundred man ; and david bring they foreskin , and they give they in full tale to the king , that he might be the king 's son in law .
and saul give he michal he daughter to wife .
and saul see and know that the lord be with david , and that michal saul 's daughter love he .
and saul be yet the more afraid of david ; and saul become david 's enemy continually .
then the prince of the philistines go forth : and it come to pass , after they go forth , that david behave himself more wisely than all the servant of saul ; so that he name be much set by .
and saul speak to jonathan he son , and to all he servant , that they should kill david .
but jonathan saul 's son delighted much in david : and jonathan tell david , say , saul my father seeketh to kill thee : now therefore , i pray thee , take heed to thyself until the morning , and abide in a secret place , and hide thyself :
and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and i will commune with my father of thee ; and what i see , that i will tell thee .
and jonathan speak good of david unto saul he father , and say unto he , let not the king sin against he servant , against david ; because he have not sin against thee , and because he work have be to thee-ward very good :
for he do put he life in he hand , and slew the philistine , and the lord work a great salvation for all israel : thou sawest it , and didst rejoice : wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood , to slay david without a cause ?
and saul hearken unto the voice of jonathan : and saul sware , as the lord liveth , he shall not be slay .
and jonathan call david , and jonathan shew he all those thing .
and jonathan bring david to saul , and he be in he presence , as in time past .
and there be war again : and david go out , and fight with the philistines , and slew they with a great slaughter ; and they flee from he .
and the evil spirit from the lord be upon saul , as he sit in he house with he javelin in he hand : and david play with he hand .
and saul seek to smite david even to the wall with the javelin , but he slip away out of saul 's presence , and he smite the javelin into the wall : and david flee , and escape that night .
saul also send messenger unto david 's house , to watch he , and to slay he in the morning : and michal david 's wife tell he , say , if thou save not thy life to night , to morrow thou shalt be slay .
so michal let david down through a window : and he go , and flee , and escape .
and michal take a image , and lay it in the bed , and put a pillow of goat ' hair for he bolster , and cover it with a cloth .
and when saul send messenger to take david , she say , he be sick .
and saul send the messenger again to see david , say , bring he up to i in the bed , that i may slay he .
and when the messenger be come in , behold , there be a image in the bed , with a pillow of goat ' hair for he bolster .
and saul say unto michal , why hast thou deceive i so , and send away mine enemy , that he be escape ?
and michal answer saul , he say unto i , let i go ; why should i kill thee ?
so david flee , and escape , and come to samuel to ramah , and tell he all that saul have do to he .
and he and samuel go and dwelt in naioth .
and it be tell saul , say , behold , david be at naioth in ramah .
and saul send messenger to take david : and when they see the company of the prophet prophesy , and samuel standing as appoint over they , the spirit of god be upon the messenger of saul , and they also prophesy .
and when it be tell saul , he send other messenger , and they prophesy likewise .
and saul send messenger again the third time , and they prophesy also .
then go he also to ramah , and come to a great well that be in sechu : and he ask and say , where be samuel and david ?
and one say , behold , they be at naioth in ramah .
and he go thither to naioth in ramah : and the spirit of god be upon he also , and he go on , and prophesy , until he come to naioth in ramah .
and he strip off he clothes also , and prophesy before samuel in like manner , and lay down naked all that day and all that night .
wherefore they say , be saul also among the prophet ?
and david flee from naioth in ramah , and come and say before jonathan , what have i do ? what be mine iniquity ? and what be my sin before thy father , that he seeketh my life ?
and he say unto he , god forbid ; thou shalt not die : behold , my father will do nothing either great or small , but that he will shew it i : and why should my father hide this thing from i ? it be not so .
and david sware moreover , and say , thy father certainly knoweth that i have find grace in thine eye ; and he saith , let not jonathan know this , lest he be grieve : but truly as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , there be but a step between i and death .
then say jonathan unto david , whatsoever thy soul desireth , i will even do it for thee .
and david say unto jonathan , behold , to morrow be the new moon , and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat : but let i go , that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even .
if thy father at all miss i , then say , david earnestly ask leave of i that he might run to bethlehem he city : for there be a yearly sacrifice there for all the family .
if he say thus , it be well ; thy servant shall have peace : but if he be very wroth , then be sure that evil be determine by he .
therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant ; for thou hast bring thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee : notwithstanding , if there be in i iniquity , slay i thyself ; for why shouldest thou bring i to thy father ?
and jonathan say , far be it from thee : for if i know certainly that evil be determine by my father to come upon thee , then would not i tell it thee ?
then say david to jonathan , who shall tell i ? or what if thy father answer thee roughly ?
and jonathan say unto david , come , and let we go out into the field .
and they go out both of they into the field .
and jonathan say unto david , o lord god of israel , when i have sound my father about to morrow any time , or the third day , and , behold , if there be good toward david , and i then send not unto thee , and shew it thee ;
the lord do so and much more to jonathan : but if it please my father to do thee evil , then i will shew it thee , and send thee away , that thou mayest go in peace : and the lord be with thee , as he have be with my father .
and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew i the kindness of the lord , that i die not :
but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the lord have cut off the enemy of david every one from the face of the earth .
so jonathan make a covenant with the house of david , say , let the lord even require it at the hand of david 's enemy .
and jonathan cause david to swear again , because he love he : for he love he as he love he own soul .
then jonathan say to david , to morrow be the new moon : and thou shalt be miss , because thy seat will be empty .
and when thou hast stay three day , then thou shalt go down quickly , and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business be in hand , and shalt remain by the stone ezel .
and i will shoot three arrow on the side thereof , as though i shoot at a mark .
and , behold , i will send a lad , say , go , find out the arrow .
if i expressly say unto the lad , behold , the arrow be on this side of thee , take they ; then come thou : for there be peace to thee , and no hurt ; as the lord liveth .
but if i say thus unto the young man , behold , the arrow be beyond thee ; go thy way : for the lord have send thee away .
and as touch the matter which thou and i have speak of , behold , the lord be between thee and i for ever .
so david hide himself in the field : and when the new moon be come , the king sit he down to eat meat .
and the king sit upon he seat , as at other time , even upon a seat by the wall : and jonathan arise , and abner sit by saul 's side , and david 's place be empty .
nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day : for he think , something have befall he , he be not clean ; surely he be not clean .
and it come to pass on the morrow , which be the second day of the month , that david 's place be empty : and saul say unto jonathan he son , wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat , neither yesterday , nor to day ?
and jonathan answer saul , david earnestly ask leave of i to go to bethlehem :
and he say , let i go , i pray thee ; for we family have a sacrifice in the city ; and my brother , he have command i to be there : and now , if i have find favour in thine eye , let i get away , i pray thee , and see my brethren .
therefore he cometh not unto the king 's table .
then saul 's anger be kindle against jonathan , and he say unto he , thou son of the perverse rebellious woman , do not i know that thou hast choose the son of jesse to thine own confusion , and unto the confusion of thy mother 's nakedness ?
for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground , thou shalt not be establish , nor thy kingdom .
wherefore now send and fetch he unto i , for he shall surely die .
and jonathan answer saul he father , and say unto he , wherefore shall he be slay ? what have he do ?
and saul cast a javelin at he to smite he : whereby jonathan know that it be determine of he father to slay david .
so jonathan arise from the table in fierce anger , and do eat no meat the second day of the month : for he be grieve for david , because he father have do he shame .
and it come to pass in the morning , that jonathan go out into the field at the time appoint with david , and a little lad with he .
and he say unto he lad , run , find out now the arrow which i shoot .
and as the lad run , he shoot a arrow beyond he .
and when the lad be come to the place of the arrow which jonathan have shoot , jonathan cry after the lad , and say , be not the arrow beyond thee ?
and jonathan cry after the lad , make speed , haste , stay not .
and jonathan 's lad gather up the arrow , and come to he master .
but the lad know not any thing : only jonathan and david know the matter .
and jonathan give he artillery unto he lad , and say unto he , go , carry they to the city .
and as soon as the lad be go , david arise out of a place toward the south , and fall on he face to the ground , and bow himself three time : and they kiss one another , and weep one with another , until david exceed .
and jonathan say to david , go in peace , forasmuch as we have swear both of we in the name of the lord , say , the lord be between i and thee , and between my seed and thy seed for ever .
and he arise and depart : and jonathan go into the city .
then come david to nob to ahimelech the priest : and ahimelech be afraid at the meeting of david , and say unto he , why art thou alone , and no man with thee ?
and david say unto ahimelech the priest , the king have command i a business , and have say unto i , let no man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee , and what i have command thee : and i have appoint my servant to such and such a place .
now therefore what be under thine hand ? give i five loaf of bread in mine hand , or what there be present .
and the priest answer david , and say , there be no common bread under mine hand , but there be hallowed bread ; if the young man have keep themselves at least from woman .
and david answer the priest , and say unto he , of a truth woman have be keep from we about these three day , since i come out , and the vessel of the young man be holy , and the bread be in a manner common , yea , though it be sanctify this day in the vessel .
so the priest give he hallowed bread : for there be no bread there but the shewbread , that be take from before the lord , to put hot bread in the day when it be take away .
now a certain man of the servant of saul be there that day , detain before the lord ; and he name be doeg , a edomite , the chiefest of the herdman that belong to saul .
and david say unto ahimelech , and be there not here under thine hand spear or sword ? for i have neither bring my sword nor my weapon with i , because the king 's business require haste .
and the priest say , the sword of goliath the philistine , whom thou slewest in the valley of elah , behold , it be here wrap in a cloth behind the ephod : if thou wilt take that , take it : for there be no other save that here .
and david say , there be none like that ; give it i .
and david arise , and flee that day for fear of saul , and go to achish the king of gath .
and the servant of achish say unto he , be not this david the king of the land ? do they not sing one to another of he in dance , say , saul have slay he thousand , and david he ten thousand ?
and david lay up these word in he heart , and be sore afraid of achish the king of gath .
and he change he behaviour before they , and feign himself mad in they hand , and scrabble on the door of the gate , and let he spittle fall down upon he beard .
then say achish unto he servant , lo , ye see the man be mad : wherefore then have ye bring he to i ?
have i need of mad man , that ye have bring this fellow to play the mad man in my presence ? shall this fellow come into my house ?
david therefore depart thence , and escape to the cave adullam : and when he brethren and all he father 's house hear it , they go down thither to he .
and every one that be in distress , and every one that be in debt , and every one that be discontented , gather themselves unto he ; and he become a captain over they : and there be with he about four hundred man .
and david go thence to mizpeh of moab : and he say unto the king of moab , let my father and my mother , i pray thee , come forth , and be with you , till i know what god will do for i .
and he bring they before the king of moab : and they dwell with he all the while that david be in the hold .
and the prophet gad say unto david , abide not in the hold ; depart , and get thee into the land of judah .
then david depart , and come into the forest of hareth .
when saul hear that david be discover , and the man that be with he , ( now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah , have he spear in he hand , and all he servant be stand about he ; )
then saul say unto he servant that stand about he , hear now , ye benjamite ; will the son of jesse give every one of you field and vineyard , and make you all captain of thousand , and captain of hundred ;
that all of you have conspire against i , and there be none that sheweth i that my son have make a league with the son of jesse , and there be none of you that be sorry for i , or sheweth unto i that my son have stir up my servant against i , to lie in wait , as at this day ?
then answer doeg the edomite , which be set over the servant of saul , and say , i see the son of jesse come to nob , to ahimelech the son of ahitub .
and he enquire of the lord for he , and give he victuals , and give he the sword of goliath the philistine .
then the king send to call ahimelech the priest , the son of ahitub , and all he father 's house , the priest that be in nob : and they come all of they to the king .
and saul say , hear now , thou son of ahitub .
and he answer , here i be , my lord .
and saul say unto he , why have ye conspire against i , thou and the son of jesse , in that thou hast give he bread , and a sword , and hast enquire of god for he , that he should rise against i , to lie in wait , as at this day ?
then ahimelech answer the king , and say , and who be so faithful among all thy servant as david , which be the king 's son in law , and goeth at thy bidding , and be honourable in thine house ?
do i then begin to enquire of god for he ? be it far from i : let not the king impute any thing unto he servant , nor to all the house of my father : for thy servant know nothing of all this , less or more .
and the king say , thou shalt surely die , ahimelech , thou , and all thy father 's house .
and the king say unto the footman that stand about he , turn , and slay the priest of the lord : because they hand also be with david , and because they know when he flee , and do not shew it to i .
but the servant of the king would not put forth they hand to fall upon the priest of the lord .
and the king say to doeg , turn thou , and fall upon the priest .
and doeg the edomite turn , and he fall upon the priest , and slew on that day fourscore and five person that do wear a linen ephod .
and nob , the city of the priest , smite he with the edge of the sword , both man and woman , child and suckling , and ox , and ass , and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
and one of the son of ahimelech the son of ahitub , name abiathar , escape , and flee after david .
and abiathar shewed david that saul have slay the lord 's priest .
and david say unto abiathar , i know it that day , when doeg the edomite be there , that he would surely tell saul : i have occasion the death of all the person of thy father 's house .
abide thou with i , fear not : for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life : but with i thou shalt be in safeguard .
then they tell david , say , behold , the philistines fight against keilah , and they rob the threshingfloor .
therefore david enquire of the lord , say , shall i go and smite these philistine ?
and the lord say unto david , go , and smite the philistines , and save keilah .
and david 's man say unto he , behold , we be afraid here in judah : how much more then if we come to keilah against the army of the philistines ?
then david enquire of the lord yet again .
and the lord answer he and say , arise , go down to keilah ; for i will deliver the philistines into thine hand .
so david and he man go to keilah , and fight with the philistines , and bring away they cattle , and smite they with a great slaughter .
so david save the inhabitant of keilah .
and it come to pass , when abiathar the son of ahimelech flee to david to keilah , that he come down with a ephod in he hand .
and it be tell saul that david be come to keilah .
and saul say , god have deliver he into mine hand ; for he be shut in , by enter into a town that have gate and bar .
and saul call all the people together to war , to go down to keilah , to besiege david and he man .
and david know that saul secretly practise mischief against he ; and he say to abiathar the priest , bring hither the ephod .
then say david , o lord god of israel , thy servant have certainly hear that saul seeketh to come to keilah , to destroy the city for my sake .
will the man of keilah deliver i up into he hand ? will saul come down , as thy servant have hear ?
o lord god of israel , i beseech thee , tell thy servant .
and the lord say , he will come down .
then say david , will the man of keilah deliver i and my man into the hand of saul ?
and the lord say , they will deliver thee up .
then david and he man , which be about six hundred , arise and depart out of keilah , and go whithersoever they could go .
and it be tell saul that david be escape from keilah ; and he forbare to go forth .
and david abode in the wilderness in strong hold , and remain in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph .
and saul seek he every day , but god deliver he not into he hand .
and david see that saul be come out to seek he life : and david be in the wilderness of ziph in a wood .
and jonathan saul 's son arise , and go to david into the wood , and strengthen he hand in god .
and he say unto he , fear not : for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee ; and thou shalt be king over israel , and i shall be next unto thee ; and that also saul my father knoweth .
and they two make a covenant before the lord : and david abode in the wood , and jonathan go to he house .
then come up the ziphites to saul to gibeah , say , doth not david hide himself with we in strong hold in the wood , in the hill of hachilah , which be on the south of jeshimon ?
now therefore , o king , come down accord to all the desire of thy soul to come down ; and we part shall be to deliver he into the king 's hand .
and saul say , blessed be ye of the lord ; for ye have compassion on i .
go , i pray you , prepare yet , and know and see he place where he haunt be , and who have see he there : for it be tell i that he dealeth very subtilly .
see therefore , and take knowledge of all the lurk place where he hideth himself , and come ye again to i with the certainty , and i will go with you : and it shall come to pass , if he be in the land , that i will search he out throughout all the thousand of judah .
and they arise , and go to ziph before saul : but david and he man be in the wilderness of maon , in the plain on the south of jeshimon .
saul also and he man go to seek he .
and they tell david : wherefore he come down into a rock , and abode in the wilderness of maon .
and when saul hear that , he pursue after david in the wilderness of maon .
and saul go on this side of the mountain , and david and he man on that side of the mountain : and david make haste to get away for fear of saul ; for saul and he man compass david and he man round about to take they .
but there come a messenger unto saul , say , haste thee , and come ; for the philistines have invade the land .
wherefore saul return from pursue after david , and go against the philistines : therefore they call that place selahammahlekoth .
and david go up from thence , and dwelt in strong hold at engedi .
and it come to pass , when saul be return from follow the philistines , that it be tell he , say , behold , david be in the wilderness of engedi .
then saul take three thousand choose man out of all israel , and go to seek david and he man upon the rock of the wild goat .
and he come to the sheepcote by the way , where be a cave ; and saul go in to cover he foot : and david and he man remain in the side of the cave .
and the man of david say unto he , behold the day of which the lord say unto thee , behold , i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand , that thou mayest do to he as it shall seem good unto thee .
then david arise , and cut off the skirt of saul 's robe privily .
and it come to pass afterward , that david 's heart smite he , because he have cut off saul 's skirt .
and he say unto he man , the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master , the lord 's anointed , to stretch forth mine hand against he , see he be the anointed of the lord .
so david stay he servant with these word , and suffer they not to rise against saul .
but saul rise up out of the cave , and go on he way .
david also arise afterward , and go out of the cave , and cry after saul , say , my lord the king .
and when saul look behind he , david stoop with he face to the earth , and bow himself .
and david say to saul , wherefore hearest thou man 's word , say , behold , david seeketh thy hurt ?
behold , this day thine eye have see how that the lord have deliver thee to day into mine hand in the cave : and some bid i kill thee : but mine eye spare thee ; and i say , i will not put forth mine hand against my lord ; for he be the lord 's anointed .
moreover , my father , see , yea , see the skirt of thy robe in my hand : for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe , and kill thee not , know thou and see that there be neither evil nor transgression in mine hand , and i have not sin against thee ; yet thou huntest my soul to take it .
the lord judge between i and thee , and the lord avenge i of thee : but mine hand shall not be upon thee .
as saith the proverb of the ancient , wickedness proceedeth from the wicked : but mine hand shall not be upon thee .
after whom be the king of israel come out ? after whom dost thou pursue ? after a dead dog , after a flea .
the lord therefore be judge , and judge between i and thee , and see , and plead my cause , and deliver i out of thine hand .
and it come to pass , when david have make a end of speak these word unto saul , that saul say , be this thy voice , my son david ?
and saul lift up he voice , and weep .
and he say to david , thou art more righteous than i : for thou hast reward i good , whereas i have reward thee evil .
and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast deal well with i : forasmuch as when the lord have deliver i into thine hand , thou killedst i not .
for if a man find he enemy , will he let he go well away ? wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast do unto i this day .
and now , behold , i know well that thou shalt surely be king , and that the kingdom of israel shall be establish in thine hand .
swear now therefore unto i by the lord , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after i , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and david sware unto saul .
and saul go home ; but david and he man gat they up unto the hold .
and samuel die ; and all the israelites be gather together , and lament he , and bury he in he house at ramah .
and david arise , and go down to the wilderness of paran .
and there be a man in maon , whose possession be in carmel ; and the man be very great , and he have three thousand sheep , and a thousand goat : and he be shear he sheep in carmel .
now the name of the man be nabal ; and the name of he wife abigail : and she be a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful countenance : but the man be churlish and evil in he doings ; and he be of the house of caleb .
and david hear in the wilderness that nabal do shear he sheep .
and david send out ten young man , and david say unto the young man , get you up to carmel , and go to nabal , and greet he in my name :
and thus shall ye say to he that liveth in prosperity , peace be both to thee , and peace be to thine house , and peace be unto all that thou hast .
and now i have hear that thou hast shearer : now thy shepherd which be with we , we hurt they not , neither be there ought miss unto they , all the while they be in carmel .
ask thy young man , and they will shew thee .
wherefore let the young man find favour in thine eye : for we come in a good day : give , i pray thee , whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servant , and to thy son david .
and when david 's young man come , they speak to nabal accord to all those word in the name of david , and cease .
and nabal answer david 's servant , and say , who be david ? and who be the son of jesse ? there be many servant now a day that break away every man from he master .
shall i then take my bread , and my water , and my flesh that i have kill for my shearer , and give it unto man , whom i know not whence they be ?
so david 's young man turn they way , and go again , and come and tell he all those saying .
and david say unto he man , gird ye on every man he sword .
and they gird on every man he sword ; and david also gird on he sword : and there go up after david about four hundred man ; and two hundred abode by the stuff .
but one of the young man tell abigail , nabal 's wife , say , behold , david send messenger out of the wilderness to salute we master ; and he rail on they .
but the man be very good unto we , and we be not hurt , neither miss we any thing , as long as we be conversant with they , when we be in the field :
they be a wall unto we both by night and day , all the while we be with they keep the sheep .
now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do ; for evil be determine against we master , and against all he household : for he be such a son of belial , that a man can not speak to he .
then abigail make haste , and take two hundred loaf , and two bottle of wine , and five sheep ready dress , and five measure of parched corn , and a hundred cluster of raisin , and two hundred cake of fig , and lay they on ass .
and she say unto she servant , go on before i ; behold , i come after you .
but she tell not she husband nabal .
and it be so , as she ride on the ass , that she come down by the covert of the hill , and , behold , david and he man come down against she ; and she meet they .
now david have say , surely in vain have i keep all that this fellow have in the wilderness , so that nothing be miss of all that pertained unto he : and he have requite i evil for good .
so and more also do god unto the enemy of david , if i leave of all that pertain to he by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall .
and when abigail see david , she hast , and light off the ass , and fall before david on she face , and bow herself to the ground ,
and fall at he foot , and say , upon i , my lord , upon i let this iniquity be : and let thine handmaid , i pray thee , speak in thine audience , and hear the word of thine handmaid .
let not my lord , i pray thee , regard this man of belial , even nabal : for as he name be , so be he ; nabal be he name , and folly be with he : but i thine handmaid see not the young man of my lord , whom thou didst send .
now therefore , my lord , as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , see the lord have withholden thee from come to shed blood , and from avenge thyself with thine own hand , now let thine enemy , and they that seek evil to my lord , be as nabal .
and now this blessing which thine handmaid have bring unto my lord , let it even be give unto the young man that follow my lord .
i pray thee , forgive the trespass of thine handmaid : for the lord will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fighteth the battle of the lord , and evil have not be find in thee all thy day .
yet a man be rise to pursue thee , and to seek thy soul : but the soul of my lord shall be bind in the bundle of life with the lord thy god ; and the soul of thine enemy , they shall he sling out , as out of the middle of a sling .
and it shall come to pass , when the lord shall have do to my lord accord to all the good that he have speak concern thee , and shall have appoint thee ruler over israel ;
that this shall be no grief unto thee , nor offence of heart unto my lord , either that thou hast shed blood causeless , or that my lord have avenge himself : but when the lord shall have deal well with my lord , then remember thine handmaid .
and david say to abigail , blessed be the lord god of israel , which send thee this day to meet i :
and bless be thy advice , and bless be thou , which hast keep i this day from come to shed blood , and from avenge myself with mine own hand .
for in very deed , as the lord god of israel liveth , which have keep i back from hurt thee , except thou hadst hast and come to meet i , surely there have not be leave unto nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall .
so david receive of she hand that which she have bring he , and say unto she , go up in peace to thine house ; see , i have hearken to thy voice , and have accept thy person .
and abigail come to nabal ; and , behold , he hold a feast in he house , like the feast of a king ; and nabal 's heart be merry within he , for he be very drunken : wherefore she tell he nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
but it come to pass in the morning , when the wine be go out of nabal , and he wife have tell he these thing , that he heart die within he , and he become as a stone .
and it come to pass about ten day after , that the lord smite nabal , that he die .
and when david hear that nabal be dead , he say , blessed be the lord , that have plead the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal , and have keep he servant from evil : for the lord have return the wickedness of nabal upon he own head .
and david send and commune with abigail , to take she to he to wife .
and when the servant of david be come to abigail to carmel , they speak unto she , say , david send we unto thee , to take thee to he to wife .
and she arise , and bow herself on she face to the earth , and say , behold , let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the foot of the servant of my lord .
and abigail hast , and arise , and ride upon a ass , with five damsel of hers that go after she ; and she go after the messenger of david , and become he wife .
david also take ahinoam of jezreel ; and they be also both of they he wife .
but saul have give michal he daughter , david 's wife , to phalti the son of laish , which be of gallim .
and the ziphites come unto saul to gibeah , say , doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah , which be before jeshimon ?
then saul arise , and go down to the wilderness of ziph , have three thousand choose man of israel with he , to seek david in the wilderness of ziph .
and saul pitch in the hill of hachilah , which be before jeshimon , by the way .
but david abode in the wilderness , and he see that saul come after he into the wilderness .
david therefore send out spy , and understand that saul be come in very deed .
and david arise , and come to the place where saul have pitch : and david behold the place where saul lay , and abner the son of ner , the captain of he host : and saul lay in the trench , and the people pitch round about he .
then answer david and say to ahimelech the hittite , and to abishai the son of zeruiah , brother to joab , say , who will go down with i to saul to the camp ?
and abishai say , i will go down with thee .
so david and abishai come to the people by night : and , behold , saul lay sleep within the trench , and he spear stick in the ground at he bolster : but abner and the people lay round about he .
then say abishai to david , god have deliver thine enemy into thine hand this day : now therefore let i smite he , i pray thee , with the spear even to the earth at once , and i will not smite he the second time .
and david say to abishai , destroy he not : for who can stretch forth he hand against the lord 's anointed , and be guiltless ?
david say furthermore , as the lord liveth , the lord shall smite he ; or he day shall come to die ; or he shall descend into battle , and perish .
the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lord 's anoint : but , i pray thee , take thou now the spear that be at he bolster , and the cruse of water , and let we go .
so david take the spear and the cruse of water from saul 's bolster ; and they gat they away , and no man see it , nor know it , neither awake : for they be all asleep ; because a deep sleep from the lord be fall upon they .
then david go over to the other side , and stand on the top of a hill afar off ; a great space be between they :
and david cry to the people , and to abner the son of ner , say , answerest thou not , abner ?
then abner answer and say , who art thou that criest to the king ?
and david say to abner , art not thou a valiant man ? and who be like to thee in israel ? wherefore then hast thou not keep thy lord the king ? for there come one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord .
this thing be not good that thou hast do .
as the lord liveth , ye be worthy to die , because ye have not keep you master , the lord 's anointed .
and now see where the king 's spear be , and the cruse of water that be at he bolster .
and saul know david 's voice , and say , be this thy voice , my son david ?
and david say , it be my voice , my lord , o king .
and he say , wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after he servant ? for what have i do ? or what evil be in mine hand ?
now therefore , i pray thee , let my lord the king hear the word of he servant .
if the lord have stir thee up against i , let he accept a offering : but if they be the child of man , curse be they before the lord ; for they have drive i out this day from abide in the inheritance of the lord , say , go , serve other god .
now therefore , let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the lord : for the king of israel be come out to seek a flea , as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountain .
then say saul , i have sin : return , my son david : for i will no more do thee harm , because my soul be precious in thine eye this day : behold , i have play the fool , and have err exceedingly .
and david answer and say , behold the king 's spear ! and let one of the young man come over and fetch it .
the lord render to every man he righteousness and he faithfulness ; for the lord deliver thee into my hand to day , but i would not stretch forth mine hand against the lord 's anointed .
and , behold , as thy life be much set by this day in mine eye , so let my life be much set by in the eye of the lord , and let he deliver i out of all tribulation .
then saul say to david , blessed be thou , my son david : thou shalt both do great thing , and also shalt still prevail .
so david go on he way , and saul return to he place .
and david say in he heart , i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul : there be nothing better for i than that i should speedily escape into the land of the philistines ; and saul shall despair of i , to seek i any more in any coast of israel : so shall i escape out of he hand .
and david arise , and he pass over with the six hundred man that be with he unto achish , the son of maoch , king of gath .
and david dwelt with achish at gath , he and he man , every man with he household , even david with he two wife , ahinoam the jezreelitess , and abigail the carmelitess , nabal 's wife .
and it be tell saul that david be flee to gath : and he seek no more again for he .
and david say unto achish , if i have now find grace in thine eye , let they give i a place in some town in the country , that i may dwell there : for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee ?
then achish give he ziklag that day : wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the king of judah unto this day .
and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistine be a full year and four month .
and david and he man go up , and invade the geshurites , and the gezrites , and the amalekites : for those nation be of old the inhabitant of the land , as thou goest to shur , even unto the land of egypt .
and david smite the land , and leave neither man nor woman alive , and take away the sheep , and the ox , and the ass , and the camel , and the apparel , and return , and come to achish .
and achish say , whither have ye make a road to day ?
and david say , against the south of judah , and against the south of the jerahmeelites , and against the south of the kenites .
and david save neither man nor woman alive , to bring tiding to gath , say , lest they should tell on we , say , so do david , and so will be he manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the philistines .
and achish believe david , say , he have make he people israel utterly to abhor he ; therefore he shall be my servant for ever .
and it come to pass in those day , that the philistines gather they army together for warfare , to fight with israel .
and achish say unto david , know thou assuredly , that thou shalt go out with i to battle , thou and thy man .
and david say to achish , surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do .
and achish say to david , therefore will i make thee keeper of mine head for ever .
now samuel be dead , and all israel have lament he , and bury he in ramah , even in he own city .
and saul have put away those that have familiar spirit , and the wizard , out of the land .
and the philistines gather themselves together , and come and pitch in shunem : and saul gather all israel together , and they pitch in gilboa .
and when saul see the host of the philistines , he be afraid , and he heart greatly tremble .
and when saul enquire of the lord , the lord answer he not , neither by dream , nor by urim , nor by prophet .
then say saul unto he servant , seek i a woman that have a familiar spirit , that i may go to she , and enquire of she .
and he servant say to he , behold , there be a woman that have a familiar spirit at endor .
and saul disguise himself , and put on other raiment , and he go , and two man with he , and they come to the woman by night : and he say , i pray thee , divine unto i by the familiar spirit , and bring i he up , whom i shall name unto thee .
and the woman say unto he , behold , thou knowest what saul have do , how he have cut off those that have familiar spirit , and the wizard , out of the land : wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life , to cause i to die ?
and saul sware to she by the lord , say , as the lord liveth , there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing .
then say the woman , whom shall i bring up unto thee ?
and he say , bring i up samuel .
and when the woman see samuel , she cry with a loud voice : and the woman spake to saul , say , why hast thou deceive i ? for thou art saul .
and the king say unto she , be not afraid : for what sawest thou ?
and the woman say unto saul , i see god ascend out of the earth .
and he say unto she , what form be he of ?
and she say , a old man cometh up ; and he be cover with a mantle .
and saul perceive that it be samuel , and he stoop with he face to the ground , and bow himself .
and samuel say to saul , why hast thou disquiet i , to bring i up ?
and saul answer , i be sore distressed ; for the philistine make war against i , and god be depart from i , and answereth i no more , neither by prophet , nor by dream : therefore i have call thee , that thou mayest make known unto i what i shall do .
then say samuel , wherefore then dost thou ask of i , see the lord be depart from thee , and be become thine enemy ?
and the lord have do to he , as he speak by i : for the lord have rent the kingdom out of thine hand , and give it to thy neighbour , even to david :
because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord , nor executedst he fierce wrath upon amalek , therefore have the lord do this thing unto thee this day .
moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the hand of the philistines : and to morrow shalt thou and thy son be with i : the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of the philistines .
then saul fall straightway all along on the earth , and be sore afraid , because of the word of samuel : and there be no strength in he ; for he have eat no bread all the day , nor all the night .
and the woman come unto saul , and see that he be sore troubled , and say unto he , behold , thine handmaid have obey thy voice , and i have put my life in my hand , and have hearken unto thy word which thou spakest unto i .
now therefore , i pray thee , hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid , and let i set a morsel of bread before thee ; and eat , that thou mayest have strength , when thou goest on thy way .
but he refuse , and say , i will not eat .
but he servant , together with the woman , compel he ; and he hearken unto they voice .
so he arise from the earth , and sit upon the bed .
and the woman have a fat calf in the house ; and she hast , and kill it , and take flour , and knead it , and do bake unleavened bread thereof :
and she bring it before saul , and before he servant ; and they do eat .
then they rise up , and go away that night .
now the philistines gather together all they army to aphek : and the israelites pitch by a fountain which be in jezreel .
and the lord of the philistines pass on by hundred , and by thousand : but david and he man pass on in the rereward with achish .
then say the prince of the philistines , what do these hebrew here ?
and achish say unto the prince of the philistines , be not this david , the servant of saul the king of israel , which have be with i these day , or these year , and i have find no fault in he since he fall unto i unto this day ?
and the prince of the philistines be wroth with he ; and the prince of the philistines say unto he , make this fellow return , that he may go again to he place which thou hast appoint he , and let he not go down with we to battle , lest in the battle he be a adversary to we : for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto he master ? should it not be with the head of these man ?
be not this david , of whom they sing one to another in dance , say , saul slew he thousand , and david he ten thousand ?
then achish call david , and say unto he , surely , as the lord liveth , thou hast be upright , and thy go out and thy come in with i in the host be good in my sight : for i have not find evil in thee since the day of thy come unto i unto this day : nevertheless the lord favour thee not .
wherefore now return , and go in peace , that thou displease not the lord of the philistines .
and david say unto achish , but what have i do ? and what hast thou find in thy servant so long as i have be with thee unto this day , that i may not go fight against the enemy of my lord the king ?
and achish answer and say to david , i know that thou art good in my sight , as a angel of god : notwithstanding the prince of the philistines have say , he shall not go up with we to the battle .
wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master 's servant that be come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
so david and he man rise up early to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the philistines .
and the philistines go up to jezreel .
and it come to pass , when david and he man be come to ziklag on the third day , that the amalekites have invade the south , and ziklag , and smitten ziklag , and burn it with fire ;
and have take the woman captive , that be therein : they slew not any , either great or small , but carry they away , and go on they way .
so david and he man come to the city , and , behold , it be burn with fire ; and they wife , and they son , and they daughter , be take captive .
then david and the people that be with he lift up they voice and weep , until they have no more power to weep .
and david 's two wife be take captive , ahinoam the jezreelitess , and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite .
and david be greatly distressed ; for the people speak of stone he , because the soul of all the people be grieve , every man for he son and for he daughter : but david encourage himself in the lord he god .
and david say to abiathar the priest , ahimelech 's son , i pray thee , bring i hither the ephod .
and abiathar bring thither the ephod to david .
and david enquire at the lord , say , shall i pursue after this troop ? shall i overtake they ?
and he answer he , pursue : for thou shalt surely overtake they , and without fail recover all .
so david go , he and the six hundred man that be with he , and come to the brook besor , where those that be leave behind stay .
but david pursue , he and four hundred man : for two hundred abode behind , which be so faint that they could not go over the brook besor .
and they find a egyptian in the field , and bring he to david , and give he bread , and he do eat ; and they make he drink water ;
and they give he a piece of a cake of fig , and two cluster of raisin : and when he have eat , he spirit come again to he : for he have eat no bread , nor drunk any water , three day and three night .
and david say unto he , to whom belongest thou ? and whence art thou ?
and he say , i be a young man of egypt , servant to a amalekite ; and my master leave i , because three day agone i fall sick .
we make a invasion upon the south of the cherethites , and upon the coast which belongeth to judah , and upon the south of caleb ; and we burn ziklag with fire .
and david say to he , canst thou bring i down to this company ?
and he say , swear unto i by god , that thou wilt neither kill i , nor deliver i into the hand of my master , and i will bring thee down to this company .
and when he have bring he down , behold , they be spread abroad upon all the earth , eating and drinking , and dancing , because of all the great spoil that they have take out of the land of the philistines , and out of the land of judah .
and david smite they from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day : and there escape not a man of they , save four hundred young man , which ride upon camel , and flee .
and david recover all that the amalekites have carry away : and david rescue he two wife .
and there be nothing lack to they , neither small nor great , neither son nor daughter , neither spoil , nor any thing that they have take to they : david recover all .
and david take all the flock and the herd , which they drave before those other cattle , and say , this be david 's spoil .
and david come to the two hundred man , which be so faint that they could not follow david , whom they have make also to abide at the brook besor : and they go forth to meet david , and to meet the people that be with he : and when david come near to the people , he salute they .
then answer all the wicked man and man of belial , of those that go with david , and say , because they go not with we , we will not give they ought of the spoil that we have recover , save to every man he wife and he child , that they may lead they away , and depart .
then say david , ye shall not do so , my brethren , with that which the lord have give we , who have preserved we , and deliver the company that come against we into we hand .
for who will hearken unto you in this matter ? but as he part be that goeth down to the battle , so shall he part be that tarrieth by the stuff : they shall part alike .
and it be so from that day forward , that he make it a statute and a ordinance for israel unto this day .
and when david come to ziklag , he send of the spoil unto the elder of judah , even to he friend , say , behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemy of the lord ;
to they which be in bethel , and to they which be in south ramoth , and to they which be in jattir ,
and to they which be in aroer , and to they which be in siphmoth , and to they which be in eshtemoa ,
and to they which be in rachal , and to they which be in the city of the jerahmeelites , and to they which be in the city of the kenites ,
and to they which be in hormah , and to they which be in chorashan , and to they which be in athach ,
and to they which be in hebron , and to all the place where david himself and he man be wont to haunt .
now the philistines fight against israel : and the man of israel flee from before the philistines , and fall down slay in mount gilboa .
and the philistines follow hard upon saul and upon he son ; and the philistines slew jonathan , and abinadab , and melchishua , saul 's son .
and the battle go sore against saul , and the archer hit he ; and he be sore wound of the archer .
then say saul unto he armourbearer , draw thy sword , and thrust i through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust i through , and abuse i .
but he armourbearer would not ; for he be sore afraid .
therefore saul take a sword , and fall upon it .
and when he armourbearer see that saul be dead , he fall likewise upon he sword , and die with he .
so saul die , and he three son , and he armourbearer , and all he man , that same day together .
and when the man of israel that be on the other side of the valley , and they that be on the other side jordan , see that the man of israel flee , and that saul and he son be dead , they forsake the city , and flee ; and the philistines come and dwelt in they .
and it come to pass on the morrow , when the philistines come to strip the slay , that they find saul and he three son fall in mount gilboa .
and they cut off he head , and strip off he armour , and send into the land of the philistine round about , to publish it in the house of they idol , and among the people .
and they put he armour in the house of ashtaroth : and they fasten he body to the wall of bethshan .
and when the inhabitant of jabeshgilead hear of that which the philistines have do to saul ;
all the valiant man arise , and go all night , and take the body of saul and the body of he son from the wall of bethshan , and come to jabesh , and burn they there .
and they take they bone , and bury they under a tree at jabesh , and fast seven day .
now it come to pass after the death of saul , when david be return from the slaughter of the amalekites , and david have abode two day in ziklag ;
it come even to pass on the third day , that , behold , a man come out of the camp from saul with he clothes rent , and earth upon he head : and so it be , when he come to david , that he fall to the earth , and do obeisance .
and david say unto he , from whence comest thou ?
and he say unto he , out of the camp of israel be i escape .
and david say unto he , how go the matter ?
i pray thee , tell i .
and he answer , that the people be flee from the battle , and many of the people also be fall and dead ; and saul and jonathan he son be dead also .
and david say unto the young man that tell he , how knowest thou that saul and jonathan he son be dead ?
and the young man that tell he say , as i happen by chance upon mount gilboa , behold , saul lean upon he spear ; and , lo , the chariot and horseman follow hard after he .
and when he look behind he , he see i , and call unto i .
and i answer , here be i.
and he say unto i , who art thou ?
and i answer he , i be a amalekite .
he say unto i again , stand , i pray thee , upon i , and slay i : for anguish be come upon i , because my life be yet whole in i .
so i stand upon he , and slew he , because i be sure that he could not live after that he be fall : and i take the crown that be upon he head , and the bracelet that be on he arm , and have bring they hither unto my lord .
then david take hold on he clothes , and rent they ; and likewise all the man that be with he :
and they mourn , and weep , and fast until even , for saul , and for jonathan he son , and for the people of the lord , and for the house of israel ; because they be fall by the sword .
and david say unto the young man that tell he , whence art thou ?
and he answer , i be the son of a stranger , a amalekite .
and david say unto he , how wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the lord 's anoint ?
and david call one of the young man , and say , go near , and fall upon he .
and he smite he that he die .
and david say unto he , thy blood be upon thy head ; for thy mouth have testify against thee , say , i have slay the lord 's anointed .
and david lament with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan he son :
( also he bid they teach the child of judah the use of the bow : behold , it be write in the book of jasher . )
the beauty of israel be slay upon thy high place : how be the mighty fall !
tell it not in gath , publish it not in the street of askelon ; lest the daughter of the philistine rejoice , lest the daughter of the uncircumcised triumph .
ye mountain of gilboa , let there be no dew , neither let there be rain , upon you , nor field of offering : for there the shield of the mighty be vilely cast away , the shield of saul , as though he have not be anoint with oil .
from the blood of the slay , from the fat of the mighty , the bow of jonathan turn not back , and the sword of saul return not empty .
saul and jonathan be lovely and pleasant in they life , and in they death they be not divide : they be swifter than eagle , they be stronger than lion .
ye daughter of israel , weep over saul , who clothe you in scarlet , with other delight , who put on ornament of gold upon you apparel .
how be the mighty fall in the midst of the battle !
o jonathan , thou wast slay in thine high place .
i be distressed for thee , my brother jonathan : very pleasant hast thou be unto i : thy love to i be wonderful , pass the love of woman .
how be the mighty fall , and the weapon of war perish !
and it come to pass after this , that david enquire of the lord , say , shall i go up into any of the city of judah ?
and the lord say unto he , go up .
and david say , whither shall i go up ?
and he say , unto hebron .
so david go up thither , and he two wife also , ahinoam the jezreelitess , and abigail nabal 's wife the carmelite .
and he man that be with he do david bring up , every man with he household : and they dwell in the city of hebron .
and the man of judah come , and there they anoint david king over the house of judah .
and they tell david , say , that the man of jabeshgilead be they that bury saul .
and david send messenger unto the man of jabeshgilead , and say unto they , bless be ye of the lord , that ye have shew this kindness unto you lord , even unto saul , and have bury he .
and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you : and i also will requite you this kindness , because ye have do this thing .
therefore now let you hand be strengthen , and be ye valiant : for you master saul be dead , and also the house of judah have anoint i king over they .
but abner the son of ner , captain of saul 's host , take ishbosheth the son of saul , and bring he over to mahanaim ;
and make he king over gilead , and over the ashurites , and over jezreel , and over ephraim , and over benjamin , and over all israel .
ishbosheth saul 's son be forty year old when he begin to reign over israel , and reign two year .
but the house of judah follow david .
and the time that david be king in hebron over the house of judah be seven year and six month .
and abner the son of ner , and the servant of ishbosheth the son of saul , go out from mahanaim to gibeon .
and joab the son of zeruiah , and the servant of david , go out , and meet together by the pool of gibeon : and they sit down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
and abner say to joab , let the young man now arise , and play before we .
and joab say , let they arise .
then there arise and go over by number twelve of benjamin , which pertain to ishbosheth the son of saul , and twelve of the servant of david .
and they catch every one he fellow by the head , and thrust he sword in he fellow 's side ; so they fall down together : wherefore that place be call helkathhazzurim , which be in gibeon .
and there be a very sore battle that day ; and abner be beat , and the man of israel , before the servant of david .
and there be three son of zeruiah there , joab , and abishai , and asahel : and asahel be as light of foot as a wild roe .
and asahel pursue after abner ; and in go he turn not to the right hand nor to the leave from follow abner .
then abner look behind he , and say , art thou asahel ?
and he answer , i be .
and abner say to he , turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left , and lay thee hold on one of the young man , and take thee he armour .
but asahel would not turn aside from follow of he .
and abner say again to asahel , turn thee aside from follow i : wherefore should i smite thee to the ground ? how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother ?
howbeit he refuse to turn aside : wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smite he under the fifth rib , that the spear come out behind he ; and he fall down there , and die in the same place : and it come to pass , that as many as come to the place where asahel fall down and die stand still .
joab also and abishaus pursue after abner : and the sun go down when they be come to the hill of ammah , that lieth before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon .
and the child of benjamin gather themselves together after abner , and become one troop , and stand on the top of a hill .
then abner call to joab , and say , shall the sword devour for ever ? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end ? how long shall it be then , ere thou bid the people return from follow they brethren ?
and joab say , as god liveth , unless thou hadst speak , surely then in the morning the people have go up every one from follow he brother .
so joab blow a trumpet , and all the people stand still , and pursue after israel no more , neither fight they any more .
and abner and he man walk all that night through the plain , and pass over jordan , and go through all bithron , and they come to mahanaim .
and joab return from follow abner : and when he have gather all the people together , there lack of david 's servant nineteen man and asahel .
but the servant of david have smite of benjamin , and of abner 's man , so that three hundred and threescore man die .
and they take up asahel , and bury he in the sepulchre of he father , which be in bethlehem .
and joab and he man go all night , and they come to hebron at break of day .
now there be long war between the house of saul and the house of david : but david wax stronger and stronger , and the house of saul wax weaker and weaker .
and unto david be son bear in hebron : and he firstborn be amnon , of ahinoam the jezreelitess ;
and he second , chileab , of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite ; and the third , absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur ;
and the fourth , adonijah the son of haggith ; and the fifth , shephatiah the son of abital ;
and the sixth , ithream , by eglah david 's wife .
these be bear to david in hebron .
and it come to pass , while there be war between the house of saul and the house of david , that abner make himself strong for the house of saul .
and saul have a concubine , whose name be rizpah , the daughter of aiah : and ishbosheth say to abner , wherefore hast thou go in unto my father 's concubine ?
then be abner very wroth for the word of ishbosheth , and say , be i a dog 's head , which against judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of saul thy father , to he brethren , and to he friend , and have not deliver thee into the hand of david , that thou chargest i to day with a fault concern this woman ?
so do god to abner , and more also , except , as the lord have swear to david , even so i do to he ;
to translate the kingdom from the house of saul , and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah , from dan even to beersheba .
and he could not answer abner a word again , because he fear he .
and abner send messenger to david on he behalf , say , whose be the land ? say also , make thy league with i , and , behold , my hand shall be with thee , to bring about all israel unto thee .
and he say , well ; i will make a league with thee : but one thing i require of thee , that be , thou shalt not see my face , except thou first bring michal saul 's daughter , when thou comest to see my face .
and david send messenger to ishbosheth saul 's son , say , deliver i my wife michal , which i espouse to i for a hundred foreskin of the philistines .
and ishbosheth send , and take she from she husband , even from phaltiel the son of laish .
and she husband go with she along weep behind she to bahurim .
then say abner unto he , go , return .
and he return .
and abner have communication with the elder of israel , say , ye seek for david in time past to be king over you :
now then do it : for the lord have speak of david , say , by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines , and out of the hand of all they enemy .
and abner also speak in the ear of benjamin : and abner go also to speak in the ear of david in hebron all that seem good to israel , and that seem good to the whole house of benjamin .
so abner come to david to hebron , and twenty man with he .
and david make abner and the man that be with he a feast .
and abner say unto david , i will arise and go , and will gather all israel unto my lord the king , that they may make a league with thee , and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth .
and david send abner away ; and he go in peace .
and , behold , the servant of david and joab come from pursue a troop , and bring in a great spoil with they : but abner be not with david in hebron ; for he have send he away , and he be go in peace .
when joab and all the host that be with he be come , they tell joab , say , abner the son of ner come to the king , and he have send he away , and he be go in peace .
then joab come to the king , and say , what hast thou do ? behold , abner come unto thee ; why be it that thou hast send he away , and he be quite go ?
thou knowest abner the son of ner , that he come to deceive thee , and to know thy go out and thy come in , and to know all that thou doest .
and when joab be come out from david , he send messenger after abner , which bring he again from the well of sirah : but david know it not .
and when abner be return to hebron , joab take he aside in the gate to speak with he quietly , and smite he there under the fifth rib , that he die , for the blood of asahel he brother .
and afterward when david hear it , he say , i and my kingdom be guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of ner :
let it rest on the head of joab , and on all he father 's house ; and let there not fail from the house of joab one that have a issue , or that be a leper , or that leaneth on a staff , or that falleth on the sword , or that lacketh bread .
so joab and abishai he brother slew abner , because he have slay they brother asahel at gibeon in the battle .
and david say to joab , and to all the people that be with he , rend you clothes , and gird you with sackcloth , and mourn before abner .
and king david himself follow the bier .
and they bury abner in hebron : and the king lift up he voice , and weep at the grave of abner ; and all the people weep .
and the king lament over abner , and say , die abner as a fool dieth ?
thy hand be not bind , nor thy foot put into fetter : as a man falleth before wicked man , so fellest thou .
and all the people weep again over he .
and when all the people come to cause david to eat meat while it be yet day , david sware , say , so do god to i , and more also , if i taste bread , or ought else , till the sun be down .
and all the people take notice of it , and it please they : as whatsoever the king do pleased all the people .
for all the people and all israel understand that day that it be not of the king to slay abner the son of ner .
and the king say unto he servant , know ye not that there be a prince and a great man fall this day in israel ?
and i be this day weak , though anointed king ; and these man the son of zeruiah be too hard for i : the lord shall reward the doer of evil accord to he wickedness .
and when saul 's son hear that abner be dead in hebron , he hand be feeble , and all the israelites be trouble .
and saul 's son have two man that be captain of band : the name of the one be baanah , and the name of the other rechab , the son of rimmon a beerothite , of the child of benjamin : ( for beeroth also be reckon to benjamin .
and the beerothites flee to gittaim , and be sojourner there until this day . )
and jonathan , saul 's son , have a son that be lame of he foot .
he be five year old when the tiding come of saul and jonathan out of jezreel , and he nurse take he up , and flee : and it come to pass , as she make haste to flee , that he fall , and become lame .
and he name be mephibosheth .
and the son of rimmon the beerothite , rechab and baanah , go , and come about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth , who lay on a bed at noon .
and they come thither into the midst of the house , as though they would have fetch wheat ; and they smite he under the fifth rib : and rechab and baanah he brother escape .
for when they come into the house , he lay on he bed in he bedchamber , and they smite he , and slew he , and behead he , and take he head , and gat they away through the plain all night .
and they bring the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron , and say to the king , behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine enemy , which seek thy life ; and the lord have avenge my lord the king this day of saul , and of he seed .
and david answer rechab and baanah he brother , the son of rimmon the beerothite , and say unto they , as the lord liveth , who have redeem my soul out of all adversity ,
when one tell i , say , behold , saul be dead , think to have bring good tiding , i take hold of he , and slew he in ziklag , who think that i would have give he a reward for he tiding :
how much more , when wicked man have slay a righteous person in he own house upon he bed ? shall i not therefore now require he blood of you hand , and take you away from the earth ?
and david command he young man , and they slew they , and cut off they hand and they foot , and hang they up over the pool in hebron .
but they take the head of ishbosheth , and bury it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron .
then come all the tribe of israel to david unto hebron , and spake , say , behold , we be thy bone and thy flesh .
also in time past , when saul be king over we , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel : and the lord say to thee , thou shalt feed my people israel , and thou shalt be a captain over israel .
so all the elder of israel come to the king to hebron ; and king david make a league with they in hebron before the lord : and they anoint david king over israel .
david be thirty year old when he begin to reign , and he reign forty year .
in hebron he reign over judah seven year and six month : and in jerusalem he reign thirty and three year over all israel and judah .
and the king and he man go to jerusalem unto the jebusites , the inhabitant of the land : which speak unto david , say , except thou take away the blind and the lame , thou shalt not come in hither : thinking , david can not come in hither .
nevertheless david take the strong hold of zion : the same be the city of david .
and david say on that day , whosoever getteth up to the gutter , and smiteth the jebusites , and the lame and the blind , that be hate of david 's soul , he shall be chief and captain .
wherefore they say , the blind and the lame shall not come into the house .
so david dwelt in the fort , and call it the city of david .
and david build round about from millo and inward .
and david go on , and grow great , and the lord god of host be with he .
and hiram king of tyre send messenger to david , and cedar tree , and carpenter , and mason : and they build david a house .
and david perceive that the lord have establish he king over israel , and that he have exalt he kingdom for he people israel 's sake .
and david take he more concubine and wife out of jerusalem , after he be come from hebron : and there be yet son and daughter bear to david .
and these be the name of those that be bear unto he in jerusalem ; shammuah , and shobab , and nathan , and solomon ,
ibhar also , and elishua , and nepheg , and japhia ,
and elishama , and eliada , and eliphalet .
but when the philistines hear that they have anoint david king over israel , all the philistines come up to seek david ; and david hear of it , and go down to the hold .
the philistine also come and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim .
and david enquire of the lord , say , shall i go up to the philistines ? wilt thou deliver they into mine hand ?
and the lord say unto david , go up : for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into thine hand .
and david come to baalperazim , and david smite they there , and say , the lord have broken forth upon mine enemy before i , as the breach of water .
therefore he call the name of that place baalperazim .
and there they leave they image , and david and he man burn they .
and the philistines come up yet again , and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim .
and when david enquire of the lord , he say , thou shalt not go up ; but fetch a compass behind they , and come upon they over against the mulberry tree .
and let it be , when thou hearest the sound of a go in the top of the mulberry tree , that then thou shalt bestir thyself : for then shall the lord go out before thee , to smite the host of the philistines .
and david do so , as the lord have command he ; and smite the philistines from geba until thou come to gazer .
again , david gather together all the choose man of israel , thirty thousand .
and david arise , and go with all the people that be with he from baale of judah , to bring up from thence the ark of god , whose name be call by the name of the lord of host that dwelleth between the cherubim .
and they set the ark of god upon a new cart , and bring it out of the house of abinadab that be in gibeah : and uzzah and ahio , the son of abinadab , drave the new cart .
and they bring it out of the house of abinadab which be at gibeah , accompany the ark of god : and ahio go before the ark .
and david and all the house of israel play before the lord on all manner of instrument make of fir wood , even on harp , and on psaltery , and on timbrel , and on cornet , and on cymbal .
and when they come to nachon 's threshingfloor , uzzah put forth he hand to the ark of god , and take hold of it ; for the oxen shake it .
and the anger of the lord be kindle against uzzah ; and god smite he there for he error ; and there he die by the ark of god .
and david be displeased , because the lord have make a breach upon uzzah : and he call the name of the place perezuzzah to this day .
and david be afraid of the lord that day , and say , how shall the ark of the lord come to i ?
so david would not remove the ark of the lord unto he into the city of david : but david carry it aside into the house of obededom the gittite .
and the ark of the lord continue in the house of obededom the gittite three month : and the lord bless obededom , and all he household .
and it be tell king david , say , the lord have bless the house of obededom , and all that pertaineth unto he , because of the ark of god .
so david go and bring up the ark of god from the house of obededom into the city of david with gladness .
and it be so , that when they that bare the ark of the lord have go six pace , he sacrifice ox and fatling .
and david dance before the lord with all he might ; and david be gird with a linen ephod .
so david and all the house of israel bring up the ark of the lord with shout , and with the sound of the trumpet .
and as the ark of the lord come into the city of david , michal saul 's daughter look through a window , and see king david leap and dance before the lord ; and she despise he in she heart .
and they bring in the ark of the lord , and set it in he place , in the midst of the tabernacle that david have pitch for it : and david offer burnt offering and peace offering before the lord .
and as soon as david have make a end of offer burnt offering and peace offering , he bless the people in the name of the lord of host .
and he deal among all the people , even among the whole multitude of israel , as well to the woman as man , to every one a cake of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine .
so all the people depart every one to he house .
then david return to bless he household .
and michal the daughter of saul come out to meet david , and say , how glorious be the king of israel to day , who uncover himself to day in the eye of the handmaid of he servant , as one of the vain fellow shamelessly uncovereth himself !
and david say unto michal , it be before the lord , which choose i before thy father , and before all he house , to appoint i ruler over the people of the lord , over israel : therefore will i play before the lord .
and i will yet be more vile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the maidservant which thou hast speak of , of they shall i be have in honour .
therefore michal the daughter of saul have no child unto the day of she death .
and it come to pass , when the king sit in he house , and the lord have give he rest round about from all he enemy ;
that the king say unto nathan the prophet , see now , i dwell in a house of cedar , but the ark of god dwelleth within curtain .
and nathan say to the king , go , do all that be in thine heart ; for the lord be with thee .
and it come to pass that night , that the word of the lord come unto nathan , say ,
go and tell my servant david , thus saith the lord , shalt thou build i a house for i to dwell in ?
whereas i have not dwell in any house since the time that i bring up the child of israel out of egypt , even to this day , but have walk in a tent and in a tabernacle .
in all the place wherein i have walk with all the child of israel speak i a word with any of the tribe of israel , whom i command to feed my people israel , say , why build ye not i a house of cedar ?
now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant david , thus saith the lord of host , i take thee from the sheepcote , from follow the sheep , to be ruler over my people , over israel :
and i be with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemy out of thy sight , and have make thee a great name , like unto the name of the great man that be in the earth .
moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel , and will plant they , that they may dwell in a place of they own , and move no more ; neither shall the child of wickedness afflict they any more , as beforetime ,
and as since the time that i command judge to be over my people israel , and have cause thee to rest from all thine enemy .
also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee a house .
and when thy day be fulfil , and thou shalt sleep with thy father , i will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy bowels , and i will establish he kingdom .
he shall build a house for my name , and i will stablish the throne of he kingdom for ever .
i will be he father , and he shall be my son .
if he commit iniquity , i will chasten he with the rod of man , and with the stripe of the child of man :
but my mercy shall not depart away from he , as i take it from saul , whom i put away before thee .
and thine house and thy kingdom shall be establish for ever before thee : thy throne shall be establish for ever .
accord to all these word , and accord to all this vision , so do nathan speak unto david .
then go king david in , and sit before the lord , and he say , who be i , o lord god ? and what be my house , that thou hast bring i hitherto ?
and this be yet a small thing in thy sight , o lord god ; but thou hast speak also of thy servant 's house for a great while to come .
and be this the manner of man , o lord god ?
and what can david say more unto thee ? for thou , lord god , knowest thy servant .
for thy word 's sake , and accord to thine own heart , hast thou do all these great thing , to make thy servant know they .
wherefore thou art great , o lord god : for there be none like thee , neither be there any god beside thee , accord to all that we have hear with we ear .
and what one nation in the earth be like thy people , even like israel , whom god go to redeem for a people to himself , and to make he a name , and to do for you great thing and terrible , for thy land , before thy people , which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt , from the nation and they god ?
for thou hast confirm to thyself thy people israel to be a people unto thee for ever : and thou , lord , art become they god .
and now , o lord god , the word that thou hast speak concern thy servant , and concern he house , establish it for ever , and do as thou hast say .
and let thy name be magnify for ever , say , the lord of host be the god over israel : and let the house of thy servant david be establish before thee .
for thou , o lord of host , god of israel , hast reveal to thy servant , say , i will build thee a house : therefore have thy servant find in he heart to pray this prayer unto thee .
and now , o lord god , thou art that god , and thy word be true , and thou hast promise this goodness unto thy servant :
therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may continue for ever before thee : for thou , o lord god , hast speak it : and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be bless for ever .
and after this it come to pass that david smite the philistines , and subdue they : and david take methegammah out of the hand of the philistines .
and he smite moab , and measure they with a line , cast they down to the ground ; even with two line measure he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive .
and so the moabites become david 's servant , and bring gift .
david smote also hadadezer , the son of rehob , king of zobah , as he go to recover he border at the river euphrates .
and david take from he a thousand chariot , and seven hundred horseman , and twenty thousand footman : and david hough all the chariot horse , but reserve of they for a hundred chariot .
and when the syrians of damascus come to succour hadadezer king of zobah , david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand man .
then david put garrison in syria of damascus : and the syrians become servant to david , and bring gift .
and the lord preserved david whithersoever he go .
and david take the shield of gold that be on the servant of hadadezer , and bring they to jerusalem .
and from betah , and from berothai , city of hadadezer , king david take exceed much brass .
when toi king of hamath hear that david have smite all the host of hadadezer ,
then toi send joram he son unto king david , to salute he , and to bless he , because he have fight against hadadezer , and smitten he : for hadadezer have war with toi .
and joram bring with he vessel of silver , and vessel of gold , and vessel of brass :
which also king david do dedicate unto the lord , with the silver and gold that he have dedicate of all nation which he subdue ;
of syria , and of moab , and of the child of ammon , and of the philistines , and of amalek , and of the spoil of hadadezer , son of rehob , king of zobah .
and david gat he a name when he return from smite of the syrians in the valley of salt , be eighteen thousand man .
and he put garrison in edom ; throughout all edom put he garrison , and all they of edom become david 's servant .
and the lord preserved david whithersoever he go .
and david reign over all israel ; and david execute judgment and justice unto all he people .
and joab the son of zeruiah be over the host ; and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud be recorder ;
and zadok the son of ahitub , and ahimelech the son of abiathar , be the priest ; and seraiah be the scribe ;
and benaiah the son of jehoiada be over both the cherethites and the pelethites ; and david 's son be chief ruler .
and david say , be there yet any that be leave of the house of saul , that i may shew he kindness for jonathan 's sake ?
and there be of the house of saul a servant whose name be ziba .
and when they have call he unto david , the king say unto he , art thou ziba ?
and he say , thy servant be he .
and the king say , be there not yet any of the house of saul , that i may shew the kindness of god unto he ?
and ziba say unto the king , jonathan have yet a son , which be lame on he foot .
and the king say unto he , where be he ?
and ziba say unto the king , behold , he be in the house of machir , the son of ammiel , in lodebar .
then king david send , and fetch he out of the house of machir , the son of ammiel , from lodebar .
now when mephibosheth , the son of jonathan , the son of saul , be come unto david , he fall on he face , and do reverence .
and david say , mephibosheth .
and he answer , behold thy servant !
and david say unto he , fear not : for i will surely shew thee kindness for jonathan thy father 's sake , and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father ; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually .
and he bow himself , and say , what be thy servant , that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i be ?
then the king call to ziba , saul 's servant , and say unto he , i have give unto thy master 's son all that pertain to saul and to all he house .
thou therefore , and thy son , and thy servant , shall till the land for he , and thou shalt bring in the fruit , that thy master 's son may have food to eat : but mephibosheth thy master 's son shall eat bread alway at my table .
now ziba have fifteen son and twenty servant .
then say ziba unto the king , accord to all that my lord the king have command he servant , so shall thy servant do .
as for mephibosheth , say the king , he shall eat at my table , as one of the king 's son .
and mephibosheth have a young son , whose name be micha .
and all that dwelt in the house of ziba be servant unto mephibosheth .
so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem : for he do eat continually at the king 's table ; and be lame on both he foot .
and it come to pass after this , that the king of the child of ammon die , and hanun he son reign in he stead .
then say david , i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash , as he father shew kindness unto i .
and david send to comfort he by the hand of he servant for he father .
and david 's servant come into the land of the child of ammon .
and the prince of the child of ammon say unto hanun they lord , thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father , that he have send comforter unto thee ? have not david rather send he servant unto thee , to search the city , and to spy it out , and to overthrow it ?
wherefore hanun take david 's servant , and shave off the one half of they beard , and cut off they garment in the middle , even to they buttock , and send they away .
when they tell it unto david , he send to meet they , because the man be greatly ashamed : and the king say , tarry at jericho until you beard be grow , and then return .
and when the child of ammon see that they stink before david , the child of ammon send and hire the syrians of bethrehob , and the syrians of zoba , twenty thousand footman , and of king maacah a thousand man , and of ishtob twelve thousand man .
and when david hear of it , he send joab , and all the host of the mighty man .
and the child of ammon come out , and put the battle in array at the enter in of the gate : and the syrians of zoba , and of rehob , and ishtob , and maacah , be by themselves in the field .
when joab see that the front of the battle be against he before and behind , he choose of all the choice man of israel , and put they in array against the syrians :
and the rest of the people he deliver into the hand of abishai he brother , that he might put they in array against the child of ammon .
and he say , if the syrians be too strong for i , then thou shalt help i : but if the child of ammon be too strong for thee , then i will come and help thee .
be of good courage , and let we play the man for we people , and for the city of we god : and the lord do that which seemeth he good .
and joab draw nigh , and the people that be with he , unto the battle against the syrians : and they flee before he .
and when the child of ammon see that the syrians be flee , then flee they also before abishai , and enter into the city .
so joab return from the child of ammon , and come to jerusalem .
and when the syrians see that they be smite before israel , they gather themselves together .
and hadarezer send , and bring out the syrians that be beyond the river : and they come to helam ; and shobach the captain of the host of hadarezer go before they .
and when it be tell david , he gather all israel together , and pass over jordan , and come to helam .
and the syrians set themselves in array against david , and fight with he .
and the syrians flee before israel ; and david slew the man of seven hundred chariot of the syrians , and forty thousand horseman , and smite shobach the captain of they host , who die there .
and when all the king that be servant to hadarezer see that they be smite before israel , they make peace with israel , and serve they .
so the syrians fear to help the child of ammon any more .
and it come to pass , after the year be expire , at the time when king go forth to battle , that david send joab , and he servant with he , and all israel ; and they destroy the child of ammon , and besiege rabbah .
but david tarry still at jerusalem .
and it come to pass in a eveningtide , that david arise from off he bed , and walk upon the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he see a woman wash herself ; and the woman be very beautiful to look upon .
and david send and enquire after the woman .
and one say , be not this bathsheba , the daughter of eliam , the wife of uriah the hittite ?
and david send messenger , and take she ; and she come in unto he , and he lay with she ; for she be purify from she uncleanness : and she return unto she house .
and the woman conceive , and send and tell david , and say , i be with child .
and david send to joab , say , send i uriah the hittite .
and joab send uriah to david .
and when uriah be come unto he , david demand of he how joab do , and how the people do , and how the war prosper .
and david say to uriah , go down to thy house , and wash thy foot .
and uriah depart out of the king 's house , and there follow he a mess of meat from the king .
but uriah sleep at the door of the king 's house with all the servant of he lord , and go not down to he house .
and when they have tell david , say , uriah go not down unto he house , david say unto uriah , camest thou not from thy journey ? why then do thou not go down unto thine house ?
and uriah say unto david , the ark , and israel , and judah , abide in tent ; and my lord joab , and the servant of my lord , be encamp in the open field ; shall i then go into mine house , to eat and to drink , and to lie with my wife ? as thou livest , and as thy soul liveth , i will not do this thing .
and david say to uriah , tarry here to day also , and to morrow i will let thee depart .
so uriah abode in jerusalem that day , and the morrow .
and when david have call he , he do eat and drink before he ; and he make he drunk : and at even he go out to lie on he bed with the servant of he lord , but go not down to he house .
and it come to pass in the morning , that david write a letter to joab , and send it by the hand of uriah .
and he write in the letter , say , set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle , and retire ye from he , that he may be smitten , and die .
and it come to pass , when joab observe the city , that he assign uriah unto a place where he know that valiant man be .
and the man of the city go out , and fight with joab : and there fall some of the people of the servant of david ; and uriah the hittite die also .
then joab send and tell david all the thing concern the war ;
and charge the messenger , say , when thou hast make a end of tell the matter of the war unto the king ,
and if so be that the king 's wrath arise , and he say unto thee , wherefore approach ye so nigh unto the city when ye do fight ? know ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
who smite abimelech the son of jerubbesheth ? do not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon he from the wall , that he die in thebez ? why go ye nigh the wall ? then say thou , thy servant uriah the hittite be dead also .
so the messenger go , and come and shew david all that joab have send he for .
and the messenger say unto david , surely the man prevail against we , and come out unto we into the field , and we be upon they even unto the enter of the gate .
and the shooter shoot from off the wall upon thy servant ; and some of the king 's servant be dead , and thy servant uriah the hittite be dead also .
then david say unto the messenger , thus shalt thou say unto joab , let not this thing displease thee , for the sword devoureth one as well as another : make thy battle more strong against the city , and overthrow it : and encourage thou he .
and when the wife of uriah hear that uriah she husband be dead , she mourn for she husband .
and when the mourning be past , david send and fetch she to he house , and she become he wife , and bare he a son .
but the thing that david have do displeased the lord .
and the lord send nathan unto david .
and he come unto he , and say unto he , there be two man in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
the rich man have exceed many flock and herd :
but the poor man have nothing , save one little ewe lamb , which he have buy and nourish up : and it grow up together with he , and with he child ; it do eat of he own meat , and drink of he own cup , and lay in he bosom , and be unto he as a daughter .
and there come a traveller unto the rich man , and he spare to take of he own flock and of he own herd , to dress for the wayfaring man that be come unto he ; but take the poor man 's lamb , and dress it for the man that be come to he .
and david 's anger be greatly kindle against the man ; and he say to nathan , as the lord liveth , the man that have do this thing shall surely die :
and he shall restore the lamb fourfold , because he do this thing , and because he have no pity .
and nathan say to david , thou art the man .
thus saith the lord god of israel , i anoint thee king over israel , and i deliver thee out of the hand of saul ;
and i give thee thy master 's house , and thy master 's wife into thy bosom , and give thee the house of israel and of judah ; and if that have be too little , i would moreover have give unto thee such and such thing .
wherefore hast thou despise the commandment of the lord , to do evil in he sight ? thou hast kill uriah the hittite with the sword , and hast take he wife to be thy wife , and hast slay he with the sword of the child of ammon .
now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house ; because thou hast despise i , and hast take the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife .
thus saith the lord , behold , i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house , and i will take thy wife before thine eye , and give they unto thy neighbour , and he shall lie with thy wife in the sight of this sun .
for thou didst it secretly : but i will do this thing before all israel , and before the sun .
and david say unto nathan , i have sin against the lord .
and nathan say unto david , the lord also have put away thy sin ; thou shalt not die .
howbeit , because by this deed thou hast give great occasion to the enemy of the lord to blaspheme , the child also that be bear unto thee shall surely die .
and nathan depart unto he house .
and the lord strike the child that uriah 's wife bare unto david , and it be very sick .
david therefore besought god for the child ; and david fast , and go in , and lay all night upon the earth .
and the elder of he house arise , and go to he , to raise he up from the earth : but he would not , neither do he eat bread with they .
and it come to pass on the seventh day , that the child die .
and the servant of david fear to tell he that the child be dead : for they say , behold , while the child be yet alive , we speak unto he , and he would not hearken unto we voice : how will he then vex himself , if we tell he that the child be dead ?
but when david see that he servant whisper , david perceive that the child be dead : therefore david say unto he servant , be the child dead ?
and they say , he be dead .
then david arise from the earth , and wash , and anoint himself , and change he apparel , and come into the house of the lord , and worship : then he come to he own house ; and when he require , they set bread before he , and he do eat .
then say he servant unto he , what thing be this that thou hast do ? thou didst fast and weep for the child , while it be alive ; but when the child be dead , thou didst rise and eat bread .
and he say , while the child be yet alive , i fast and weep : for i say , who can tell whether god will be gracious to i , that the child may live ?
but now he be dead , wherefore should i fast ? can i bring he back again ?
i shall go to he , but he shall not return to i .
and david comfort bathsheba he wife , and go in unto she , and lay with she : and she bare a son , and he call he name solomon : and the lord love he .
and he send by the hand of nathan the prophet ; and he call he name jedidiah , because of the lord .
and joab fight against rabbah of the child of ammon , and take the royal city .
and joab send messenger to david , and say , i have fight against rabbah , and have take the city of water .
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and encamp against the city , and take it : lest i take the city , and it be call after my name .
and david gather all the people together , and go to rabbah , and fight against it , and take it .
and he take they king 's crown from off he head , the weight whereof be a talent of gold with the precious stone : and it be set on david 's head .
and he bring forth the spoil of the city in great abundance .
and he bring forth the people that be therein , and put they under saw , and under harrow of iron , and under axis of iron , and make they pass through the brick-kiln : and thus do he unto all the city of the child of ammon .
so david and all the people return unto jerusalem .
and it come to pass after this , that absalom the son of david have a fair sister , whose name be tamar ; and amnon the son of david love she .
and amnon be so vexed , that he fall sick for he sister tamar ; for she be a virgin ; and amnon think it hard for he to do anything to she .
but amnon have a friend , whose name be jonadab , the son of shimeah david 's brother : and jonadab be a very subtil man .
and he say unto he , why art thou , be the king 's son , lean from day to day ? wilt thou not tell i ?
and amnon say unto he , i love tamar , my brother absalom 's sister .
and jonadab say unto he , lay thee down on thy bed , and make thyself sick : and when thy father cometh to see thee , say unto he , i pray thee , let my sister tamar come , and give i meat , and dress the meat in my sight , that i may see it , and eat it at she hand .
so amnon lay down , and make himself sick : and when the king be come to see he , amnon say unto the king , i pray thee , let tamar my sister come , and make i a couple of cake in my sight , that i may eat at she hand .
then david send home to tamar , say , go now to thy brother amnon 's house , and dress he meat .
so tamar go to she brother amnon 's house ; and he be lay down .
and she take flour , and knead it , and make cake in he sight , and do bake the cake .
and she take a pan , and pour they out before he ; but he refuse to eat .
and amnon say , have out all man from i .
and they go out every man from he .
and amnon say unto tamar , bring the meat into the chamber , that i may eat of thine hand .
and tamar take the cake which she have make , and bring they into the chamber to amnon she brother .
and when she have bring they unto he to eat , he take hold of she , and say unto she , come lie with i , my sister .
and she answer he , nay , my brother , do not force i ; for no such thing ought to be do in israel : do not thou this folly .
and i , whither shall i cause my shame to go ? and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fool in israel .
now therefore , i pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he will not withhold i from thee .
howbeit he would not hearken unto she voice : but , be stronger than she , force she , and lay with she .
then amnon hate she exceedingly ; so that the hatred wherewith he hate she be greater than the love wherewith he have love she .
and amnon say unto she , arise , be go .
and she say unto he , there be no cause : this evil in send i away be greater than the other that thou didst unto i .
but he would not hearken unto she .
then he call he servant that minister unto he , and say , put now this woman out from i , and bolt the door after she .
and she have a garment of diver colour upon she : for with such robe be the king 's daughter that be virgin apparel .
then he servant bring she out , and bolt the door after she .
and tamar put ash on she head , and rent she garment of diver colour that be on she , and lay she hand on she head , and go on cry .
and absalom she brother say unto she , hath amnon thy brother be with thee ? but hold now thy peace , my sister : he be thy brother ; regard not this thing .
so tamar remain desolate in she brother absalom 's house .
but when king david hear of all these thing , he be very wroth .
and absalom speak unto he brother amnon neither good nor bad : for absalom hate amnon , because he have force he sister tamar .
and it come to pass after two full year , that absalom have sheepshearer in baalhazor , which be beside ephraim : and absalom invite all the king 's son .
and absalom come to the king , and say , behold now , thy servant have sheepshearer ; let the king , i beseech thee , and he servant go with thy servant .
and the king say to absalom , nay , my son , let we not all now go , lest we be chargeable unto thee .
and he press he : howbeit he would not go , but bless he .
then say absalom , if not , i pray thee , let my brother amnon go with we .
and the king say unto he , why should he go with thee ?
but absalom press he , that he let amnon and all the king 's son go with he .
now absalom have command he servant , say , mark ye now when amnon 's heart be merry with wine , and when i say unto you , smite amnon ; then kill he , fear not : have not i command you ? be courageous , and be valiant .
and the servant of absalom do unto amnon as absalom have command .
then all the king 's son arise , and every man gat he up upon he mule , and flee .
and it come to pass , while they be in the way , that tiding come to david , say , absalom have slay all the king 's son , and there be not one of they leave .
then the king arise , and tare he garment , and lay on the earth ; and all he servant stand by with they clothes rent .
and jonadab , the son of shimeah david 's brother , answer and say , let not my lord suppose that they have slay all the young man the king 's son ; for amnon only be dead : for by the appointment of absalom this have be determine from the day that he force he sister tamar .
now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to he heart , to think that all the king 's son be dead : for amnon only be dead .
but absalom flee .
and the young man that keep the watch lift up he eye , and look , and , behold , there come much people by the way of the hill side behind he .
and jonadab say unto the king , behold , the king 's son come : as thy servant say , so it be .
and it come to pass , as soon as he have make a end of speaking , that , behold , the king 's son come , and lift up they voice and weep : and the king also and all he servant weep very sore .
but absalom flee , and go to talmai , the son of ammihud , king of geshur .
and david mourn for he son every day .
so absalom flee , and go to geshur , and be there three year .
and the soul of king david long to go forth unto absalom : for he be comfort concern amnon , see he be dead .
now joab the son of zeruiah perceive that the king 's heart be toward absalom .
and joab send to tekoah , and fetch thence a wise woman , and say unto she , i pray thee , feign thyself to be a mourner , and put on now mourn apparel , and anoint not thyself with oil , but be as a woman that have a long time mourn for the dead :
and come to the king , and speak on this manner unto he .
so joab put the word in she mouth .
and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king , she fall on she face to the ground , and do obeisance , and say , help , o king .
and the king say unto she , what aileth thee ?
and she answer , i be indeed a widow woman , and mine husband be dead .
and thy handmaid have two son , and they two strive together in the field , and there be none to part they , but the one smite the other , and slew he .
and , behold , the whole family be rise against thine handmaid , and they say , deliver he that smite he brother , that we may kill he , for the life of he brother whom he slew ; and we will destroy the heir also : and so they shall quench my coal which be leave , and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth .
and the king say unto the woman , go to thine house , and i will give charge concern thee .
and the woman of tekoah say unto the king , my lord , o king , the iniquity be on i , and on my father 's house : and the king and he throne be guiltless .
and the king say , whosoever saith ought unto thee , bring he to i , and he shall not touch thee any more .
then say she , i pray thee , let the king remember the lord thy god , that thou wouldest not suffer the revenger of blood to destroy any more , lest they destroy my son .
and he say , as the lord liveth , there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth .
then the woman say , let thine handmaid , i pray thee , speak one word unto my lord the king .
and he say , say on .
and the woman say , wherefore then hast thou think such a thing against the people of god ? for the king doth speak this thing as one which be faulty , in that the king doth not fetch home again he banish .
for we must need die , and be as water spill on the ground , which can not be gather up again ; neither doth god respect any person : yet doth he devise means , that he banish be not expel from he .
now therefore that i be come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king , it be because the people have make i afraid : and thy handmaid say , i will now speak unto the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of he handmaid .
for the king will hear , to deliver he handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy i and my son together out of the inheritance of god .
then thine handmaid say , the word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable : for as a angel of god , so be my lord the king to discern good and bad : therefore the lord thy god will be with thee .
then the king answer and say unto the woman , hide not from i , i pray thee , the thing that i shall ask thee .
and the woman say , let my lord the king now speak .
and the king say , be not the hand of joab with thee in all this ?
and the woman answer and say , as thy soul liveth , my lord the king , none can turn to the right hand or to the leave from ought that my lord the king have speak : for thy servant joab , he bid i , and he put all these word in the mouth of thine handmaid :
to fetch about this form of speech have thy servant joab do this thing : and my lord be wise , accord to the wisdom of a angel of god , to know all thing that be in the earth .
and the king say unto joab , behold now , i have do this thing : go therefore , bring the young man absalom again .
and joab fall to the ground on he face , and bow himself , and thank the king : and joab say , to day thy servant knoweth that i have find grace in thy sight , my lord , o king , in that the king have fulfil the request of he servant .
so joab arise and go to geshur , and bring absalom to jerusalem .
and the king say , let he turn to he own house , and let he not see my face .
so absalom return to he own house , and see not the king 's face .
but in all israel there be none to be so much praise as absalom for he beauty : from the sole of he foot even to the crown of he head there be no blemish in he .
and when he poll he head , ( for it be at every year 's end that he poll it : because the hair be heavy on he , therefore he poll it : ) he weigh the hair of he head at two hundred shekel after the king 's weight .
and unto absalom there be bear three son , and one daughter , whose name be tamar : she be a woman of a fair countenance .
so absalom dwelt two full year in jerusalem , and see not the king 's face .
therefore absalom send for joab , to have send he to the king ; but he would not come to he : and when he send again the second time , he would not come .
therefore he say unto he servant , see , joab 's field be near mine , and he have barley there ; go and set it on fire .
and absalom 's servant set the field on fire .
then joab arise , and come to absalom unto he house , and say unto he , wherefore have thy servant set my field on fire ?
and absalom answer joab , behold , i send unto thee , say , come hither , that i may send thee to the king , to say , wherefore be i come from geshur ? it have be good for i to have be there still : now therefore let i see the king 's face ; and if there be any iniquity in i , let he kill i .
so joab come to the king , and tell he : and when he have call for absalom , he come to the king , and bow himself on he face to the ground before the king : and the king kiss absalom .
and it come to pass after this , that absalom prepare he chariot and horse , and fifty man to run before he .
and absalom rise up early , and stand beside the way of the gate : and it be so , that when any man that have a controversy come to the king for judgment , then absalom call unto he , and say , of what city art thou ?
and he say , thy servant be of one of the tribe of israel .
and absalom say unto he , see , thy matter be good and right ; but there be no man depute of the king to hear thee .
absalom say moreover , oh that i be make judge in the land , that every man which have any suit or cause might come unto i , and i would do he justice !
and it be so , that when any man come nigh to he to do he obeisance , he put forth he hand , and take he , and kiss he .
and on this manner do absalom to all israel that come to the king for judgment : so absalom steal the heart of the man of israel .
and it come to pass after forty year , that absalom say unto the king , i pray thee , let i go and pay my vow , which i have vow unto the lord , in hebron .
for thy servant vow a vow while i abide at geshur in syria , say , if the lord shall bring i again indeed to jerusalem , then i will serve the lord .
and the king say unto he , go in peace .
so he arise , and go to hebron .
but absalom send spy throughout all the tribe of israel , say , as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet , then ye shall say , absalom reigneth in hebron .
and with absalom go two hundred man out of jerusalem , that be call ; and they go in they simplicity , and they know not any thing .
and absalom send for ahithophel the gilonite , david 's counsellor , from he city , even from giloh , while he offer sacrifice .
and the conspiracy be strong ; for the people increase continually with absalom .
and there come a messenger to david , say , the heart of the man of israel be after absalom .
and david say unto all he servant that be with he at jerusalem , arise , and let we flee ; for we shall not else escape from absalom : make speed to depart , lest he overtake we suddenly , and bring evil upon we , and smite the city with the edge of the sword .
and the king 's servant say unto the king , behold , thy servant be ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint .
and the king go forth , and all he household after he .
and the king leave ten woman , which be concubine , to keep the house .
and the king go forth , and all the people after he , and tarry in a place that be far off .
and all he servant pass on beside he ; and all the cherethites , and all the pelethites , and all the gittites , six hundred man which come after he from gath , pass on before the king .
then say the king to ittai the gittite , wherefore goest thou also with we ? return to thy place , and abide with the king : for thou art a stranger , and also a exile .
whereas thou camest but yesterday , should i this day make thee go up and down with we ? see i go whither i may , return thou , and take back thy brethren : mercy and truth be with thee .
and ittaus answer the king , and say , as the lord liveth , and as my lord the king liveth , surely in what place my lord the king shall be , whether in death or life , even there also will thy servant be .
and david say to ittai , go and pass over .
and ittai the gittite pass over , and all he man , and all the little one that be with he .
and all the country weep with a loud voice , and all the people pass over : the king also himself pass over the brook kidron , and all the people pass over , toward the way of the wilderness .
and lo zadok also , and all the levites be with he , bear the ark of the covenant of god : and they set down the ark of god ; and abiathar go up , until all the people have do pass out of the city .
and the king say unto zadok , carry back the ark of god into the city : if i shall find favour in the eye of the lord , he will bring i again , and shew i both it , and he habitation :
but if he thus say , i have no delight in thee ; behold , here be i , let he do to i as seemeth good unto he .
the king say also unto zadok the priest , art not thou a seer ? return into the city in peace , and you two son with you , ahimaaz thy son , and jonathan the son of abiathar .
see , i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness , until there come word from you to certify i .
zadok therefore and abiathar carry the ark of god again to jerusalem : and they tarry there .
and david go up by the ascent of mount olivet , and weep as he go up , and have he head cover , and he go barefoot : and all the people that be with he cover every man he head , and they go up , weep as they go up .
and one tell david , say , ahithophel be among the conspirator with absalom .
and david say , o lord , i pray thee , turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness .
and it come to pass , that when david be come to the top of the mount , where he worship god , behold , hushai the archite come to meet he with he coat rent , and earth upon he head :
unto whom david say , if thou passest on with i , then thou shalt be a burden unto i :
but if thou return to the city , and say unto absalom , i will be thy servant , o king ; as i have be thy father 's servant hitherto , so will i now also be thy servant : then mayest thou for i defeat the counsel of ahithophel .
and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priest ? therefore it shall be , that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king 's house , thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priest .
behold , they have there with they they two son , ahimaaz zadok 's son , and jonathan abiathar 's son ; and by they ye shall send unto i every thing that ye can hear .
so hushai david 's friend come into the city , and absalom come into jerusalem .
and when david be a little past the top of the hill , behold , ziba the servant of mephibosheth meet he , with a couple of ass saddle , and upon they two hundred loaf of bread , and a hundred bunch of raisin , and a hundred of summer fruit , and a bottle of wine .
and the king say unto ziba , what meanest thou by these ?
and ziba say , the ass be for the king 's household to ride on ; and the bread and summer fruit for the young man to eat ; and the wine , that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink .
and the king say , and where be thy master 's son ?
and ziba say unto the king , behold , he abideth at jerusalem : for he say , to day shall the house of israel restore i the kingdom of my father .
then say the king to ziba , behold , thine be all that pertain unto mephibosheth .
and ziba say , i humbly beseech thee that i may find grace in thy sight , my lord , o king .
and when king david come to bahurim , behold , thence come out a man of the family of the house of saul , whose name be shimei , the son of gera : he come forth , and curse still as he come .
and he cast stone at david , and at all the servant of king david : and all the people and all the mighty man be on he right hand and on he left .
and thus say shimei when he curse , come out , come out , thou bloody man , and thou man of belial :
the lord have return upon thee all the blood of the house of saul , in whose stead thou hast reign ; and the lord have deliver the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son : and , behold , thou art take in thy mischief , because thou art a bloody man .
then say abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king , why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? let i go over , i pray thee , and take off he head .
and the king say , what have i to do with you , ye son of zeruiah ? so let he curse , because the lord have say unto he , curse david .
who shall then say , wherefore hast thou do so ?
and david say to abishai , and to all he servant , behold , my son , which come forth of my bowels , seeketh my life : how much more now may this benjamite do it ? let he alone , and let he curse ; for the lord have bid he .
it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction , and that the lord will requite i good for he cursing this day .
and as david and he man go by the way , shimei go along on the hill 's side over against he , and curse as he go , and throw stone at he , and cast dust .
and the king , and all the people that be with he , come weary , and refresh themselves there .
and absalom , and all the people the man of israel , come to jerusalem , and ahithophel with he .
and it come to pass , when hushai the archite , david 's friend , be come unto absalom , that hushai say unto absalom , god save the king , god save the king .
and absalom say to hushai , be this thy kindness to thy friend ? why wentest thou not with thy friend ?
and hushai say unto absalom , nay ; but whom the lord , and this people , and all the man of israel , choose , he will i be , and with he will i abide .
and again , whom should i serve ? should i not serve in the presence of he son ? as i have serve in thy father 's presence , so will i be in thy presence .
then say absalom to ahithophel , give counsel among you what we shall do .
and ahithophel say unto absalom , go in unto thy father 's concubine , which he have leave to keep the house ; and all israel shall hear that thou art abhor of thy father : then shall the hand of all that be with thee be strong .
so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house ; and absalom go in unto he father 's concubine in the sight of all israel .
and the counsel of ahithophel , which he counsel in those day , be as if a man have enquire at the oracle of god : so be all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom .
moreover ahithophel say unto absalom , let i now choose out twelve thousand man , and i will arise and pursue after david this night :
and i will come upon he while he be weary and weak handed , and will make he afraid : and all the people that be with he shall flee ; and i will smite the king only :
and i will bring back all the people unto thee : the man whom thou seekest be as if all return : so all the people shall be in peace .
and the say pleased absalom well , and all the elder of israel .
then say absalom , call now hushai the archite also , and let we hear likewise what he saith .
and when hushai be come to absalom , absalom spake unto he , say , ahithophel have speak after this manner : shall we do after he say ? if not ; speak thou .
and hushai say unto absalom , the counsel that ahithophel have give be not good at this time .
for , say hushai , thou knowest thy father and he man , that they be mighty man , and they be chafe in they mind , as a bear rob of she whelp in the field : and thy father be a man of war , and will not lodge with the people .
behold , he be hide now in some pit , or in some other place : and it will come to pass , when some of they be overthrow at the first , that whosoever heareth it will say , there be a slaughter among the people that follow absalom .
and he also that be valiant , whose heart be as the heart of a lion , shall utterly melt : for all israel knoweth that thy father be a mighty man , and they which be with he be valiant man .
therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gather unto thee , from dan even to beersheba , as the sand that be by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in thine own person .
so shall we come upon he in some place where he shall be find , and we will light upon he as the dew falleth on the ground : and of he and of all the man that be with he there shall not be leave so much as one .
moreover , if he be get into a city , then shall all israel bring rope to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there be not one small stone find there .
and absalom and all the man of israel say , the counsel of hushai the archite be better than the counsel of ahithophel .
for the lord have appoint to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel , to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom .
then say hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priest , thus and thus do ahithophel counsel absalom and the elder of israel ; and thus and thus have i counsel .
now therefore send quickly , and tell david , say , lodge not this night in the plain of the wilderness , but speedily pass over ; lest the king be swallow up , and all the people that be with he .
now jonathan and ahimaaz stay by enrogel ; for they might not be see to come into the city : and a wench go and tell they ; and they go and tell king david .
nevertheless a lad see they , and tell absalom : but they go both of they away quickly , and come to a man 's house in bahurim , which have a well in he court ; whither they go down .
and the woman take and spread a cover over the well 's mouth , and spread ground corn thereon ; and the thing be not know .
and when absalom 's servant come to the woman to the house , they say , where be ahimaaz and jonathan ?
and the woman say unto they , they be go over the brook of water .
and when they have seek and could not find they , they return to jerusalem .
and it come to pass , after they be depart , that they come up out of the well , and go and tell king david , and say unto david , arise , and pass quickly over the water : for thus have ahithophel counsel against you .
then david arise , and all the people that be with he , and they pass over jordan : by the morning light there lack not one of they that be not go over jordan .
and when ahithophel see that he counsel be not follow , he saddle he ass , and arise , and gat he home to he house , to he city , and put he household in order , and hang himself , and die , and be bury in the sepulchre of he father .
then david come to mahanaim .
and absalom pass over jordan , he and all the man of israel with he .
and absalom make amasa captain of the host instead of joab : which amasa be a man 's son , whose name be ithra a israelite , that go in to abigail the daughter of nahash , sister to zeruiah joab 's mother .
so israel and absalom pitch in the land of gilead .
and it come to pass , when david be come to mahanaim , that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the child of ammon , and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar , and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim ,
brought bed , and bason , and earthen vessel , and wheat , and barley , and flour , and parched corn , and bean , and lentile , and parched pulse ,
and honey , and butter , and sheep , and cheese of kine , for david , and for the people that be with he , to eat : for they say , the people be hungry , and weary , and thirsty , in the wilderness .
and david number the people that be with he , and set captain of thousand and captain of hundred over they .
and david send forth a third part of the people under the hand of joab , and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah , joab 's brother , and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite .
and the king say unto the people , i will surely go forth with you myself also .
but the people answer , thou shalt not go forth : for if we flee away , they will not care for we ; neither if half of we die , will they care for we : but now thou art worth ten thousand of we : therefore now it be better that thou succour we out of the city .
and the king say unto they , what seemeth you best i will do .
and the king stand by the gate side , and all the people come out by hundred and by thousand .
and the king command joab and abishai and ittai , say , deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with absalom .
and all the people hear when the king give all the captain charge concern absalom .
so the people go out into the field against israel : and the battle be in the wood of ephraim ;
where the people of israel be slay before the servant of david , and there be there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand man .
for the battle be there scatter over the face of all the country : and the wood devour more people that day than the sword devour .
and absalom meet the servant of david .
and absalom ride upon a mule , and the mule go under the thick bough of a great oak , and he head catch hold of the oak , and he be take up between the heaven and the earth ; and the mule that be under he go away .
and a certain man see it , and tell joab , and say , behold , i see absalom hang in a oak .
and joab say unto the man that tell he , and , behold , thou sawest he , and why didst thou not smite he there to the ground ? and i would have give thee ten shekel of silver , and a girdle .
and the man say unto joab , though i should receive a thousand shekel of silver in mine hand , yet would i not put forth mine hand against the king 's son : for in we hear the king charge thee and abishai and ittai , say , beware that none touch the young man absalom .
otherwise i should have work falsehood against mine own life : for there be no matter hide from the king , and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against i .
then say joab , i may not tarry thus with thee .
and he take three dart in he hand , and thrust they through the heart of absalom , while he be yet alive in the midst of the oak .
and ten young man that bare joab 's armour compass about and smite absalom , and slew he .
and joab blow the trumpet , and the people return from pursue after israel : for joab hold back the people .
and they take absalom , and cast he into a great pit in the wood , and lay a very great heap of stone upon he : and all israel flee every one to he tent .
now absalom in he lifetime have take and rear up for himself a pillar , which be in the king 's dale : for he say , i have no son to keep my name in remembrance : and he call the pillar after he own name : and it be call unto this day , absalom 's place .
then say ahimaaz the son of zadok , let i now run , and bear the king tiding , how that the lord have avenge he of he enemy .
and joab say unto he , thou shalt not bear tiding this day , but thou shalt bear tiding another day : but this day thou shalt bear no tiding , because the king 's son be dead .
then say joab to cushi , go tell the king what thou hast see .
and cushi bow himself unto joab , and run .
then say ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab , but howsoever , let i , i pray thee , also run after cushi .
and joab say , wherefore wilt thou run , my son , see that thou hast no tiding ready ?
but howsoever , say he , let i run .
and he say unto he , run .
then ahimaaz run by the way of the plain , and overran cushus .
and david sit between the two gate : and the watchman go up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lift up he eye , and look , and behold a man running alone .
and the watchman cry , and tell the king .
and the king say , if he be alone , there be tiding in he mouth .
and he come apace , and draw near .
and the watchman see another man running : and the watchman call unto the porter , and say , behold another man running alone .
and the king say , he also bringeth tiding .
and the watchman say , i thinketh the running of the foremost be like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok .
and the king say , he be a good man , and cometh with good tiding .
and ahimaaz call , and say unto the king , all be well .
and he fall down to the earth upon he face before the king , and say , blessed be the lord thy god , which have deliver up the man that lift up they hand against my lord the king .
and the king say , be the young man absalom safe ?
and ahimaaz answer , when joab send the king 's servant , and i thy servant , i see a great tumult , but i know not what it be .
and the king say unto he , turn aside , and stand here .
and he turn aside , and stand still .
and , behold , cushi come ; and cushi say , tidings , my lord the king : for the lord have avenge thee this day of all they that rise up against thee .
and the king say unto cushi , be the young man absalom safe ?
and cushus answer , the enemy of my lord the king , and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt , be as that young man be .
and the king be much move , and go up to the chamber over the gate , and weep : and as he go , thus he say , o my son absalom , my son , my son absalom ! would god i have die for thee , o absalom , my son , my son !
and it be tell joab , behold , the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom .
and the victory that day be turn into mourning unto all the people : for the people hear say that day how the king be grieve for he son .
and the people gat they by stealth that day into the city , as people be ashamed steal away when they flee in battle .
but the king cover he face , and the king cry with a loud voice , o my son absalom , o absalom , my son , my son !
and joab come into the house to the king , and say , thou hast shame this day the face of all thy servant , which this day have save thy life , and the life of thy son and of thy daughter , and the life of thy wife , and the life of thy concubine ;
in that thou lovest thine enemy , and hatest thy friend .
for thou hast declare this day , that thou regardest neither prince nor servant : for this day i perceive , that if absalom have live , and all we have die this day , then it have pleased thee well .
now therefore arise , go forth , and speak comfortably unto thy servant : for i swear by the lord , if thou go not forth , there will not tarry one with thee this night : and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befall thee from thy youth until now .
then the king arise , and sit in the gate .
and they tell unto all the people , say , behold , the king doth sit in the gate .
and all the people come before the king : for israel have flee every man to he tent .
and all the people be at strife throughout all the tribe of israel , say , the king save we out of the hand of we enemy , and he deliver we out of the hand of the philistines ; and now he be flee out of the land for absalom .
and absalom , whom we anoint over we , be dead in battle .
now therefore why speak ye not a word of bring the king back ?
and king david send to zadok and to abiathar the priest , say , speak unto the elder of judah , say , why be ye the last to bring the king back to he house ? see the speech of all israel be come to the king , even to he house .
ye be my brethren , ye be my bone and my flesh : wherefore then be ye the last to bring back the king ?
and say ye to amasa , art thou not of my bone , and of my flesh ?
god do so to i , and more also , if thou be not captain of the host before i continually in the room of joab .
and he bow the heart of all the man of judah , even as the heart of one man ; so that they send this word unto the king , return thou , and all thy servant .
so the king return , and come to jordan .
and judah come to gilgal , to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over jordan .
and shimei the son of gera , a benjamite , which be of bahurim , hast and come down with the man of judah to meet king david .
and there be a thousand man of benjamin with he , and ziba the servant of the house of saul , and he fifteen son and he twenty servant with he ; and they go over jordan before the king .
and there go over a ferry boat to carry over the king 's household , and to do what he think good .
and shimei the son of gera fall down before the king , as he be come over jordan ;
and say unto the king , let not my lord impute iniquity unto i , neither do thou remember that which thy servant do perversely the day that my lord the king go out of jerusalem , that the king should take it to he heart .
for thy servant doth know that i have sin : therefore , behold , i be come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
but abishai the son of zeruiah answer and say , shall not shimei be put to death for this , because he curse the lord 's anoint ?
and david say , what have i to do with you , ye son of zeruiah , that ye should this day be adversary unto i ? shall there any man be put to death this day in israel ? for do not i know that i be this day king over israel ?
therefore the king say unto shimei , thou shalt not die .
and the king sware unto he .
and mephibosheth the son of saul come down to meet the king , and have neither dress he foot , nor trim he beard , nor washed he clothes , from the day the king depart until the day he come again in peace .
and it come to pass , when he be come to jerusalem to meet the king , that the king say unto he , wherefore wentest not thou with i , mephibosheth ?
and he answer , my lord , o king , my servant deceive i : for thy servant say , i will saddle i a ass , that i may ride thereon , and go to the king ; because thy servant be lame .
and he have slandered thy servant unto my lord the king ; but my lord the king be as a angel of god : do therefore what be good in thine eye .
for all of my father 's house be but dead man before my lord the king : yet didst thou set thy servant among they that do eat at thine own table .
what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto the king ?
and the king say unto he , why speakest thou any more of thy matter ?
i have say , thou and ziba divide the land .
and mephibosheth say unto the king , yea , let he take all , forasmuch as my lord the king be come again in peace unto he own house .
and barzillai the gileadite come down from rogelim , and go over jordan with the king , to conduct he over jordan .
now barzillai be a very aged man , even fourscore year old : and he have provide the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim ; for he be a very great man .
and the king say unto barzillai , come thou over with i , and i will feed thee with i in jerusalem .
and barzillai say unto the king , how long have i to live , that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem ?
i be this day fourscore year old : and can i discern between good and evil ? can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink ? can i hear any more the voice of singing man and singing woman ? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king ?
thy servant will go a little way over jordan with the king : and why should the king recompense it i with such a reward ?
let thy servant , i pray thee , turn back again , that i may die in mine own city , and be bury by the grave of my father and of my mother .
but behold thy servant chimham ; let he go over with my lord the king ; and do to he what shall seem good unto thee .
and the king answer , chimham shall go over with i , and i will do to he that which shall seem good unto thee : and whatsoever thou shalt require of i , that will i do for thee .
and all the people go over jordan .
and when the king be come over , the king kiss barzillai , and bless he ; and he return unto he own place .
then the king go on to gilgal , and chimham go on with he : and all the people of judah conduct the king , and also half the people of israel .
and , behold , all the man of israel come to the king , and say unto the king , why have we brethren the man of judah steal thee away , and have bring the king , and he household , and all david 's man with he , over jordan ?
and all the man of judah answer the man of israel , because the king be near of kin to we : wherefore then be ye angry for this matter ? have we eat at all of the king 's cost ? or have he give we any gift ?
and the man of israel answer the man of judah , and say , we have ten part in the king , and we have also more right in david than ye : why then do ye despise we , that we advice should not be first have in bring back we king ?
and the word of the man of judah be fiercer than the word of the man of israel .
and there happen to be there a man of belial , whose name be sheba , the son of bichri , a benjamite : and he blow a trumpet , and say , we have no part in david , neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse : every man to he tent , o israel .
so every man of israel go up from after david , and follow sheba the son of bichri : but the man of judah cleave unto they king , from jordan even to jerusalem .
and david come to he house at jerusalem ; and the king take the ten woman he concubine , whom he have leave to keep the house , and put they in ward , and feed they , but go not in unto they .
so they be shut up unto the day of they death , live in widowhood .
then say the king to amasa , assemble i the man of judah within three day , and be thou here present .
so amasa go to assemble the man of judah : but he tarry longer than the set time which he have appoint he .
and david say to abishai , now shall sheba the son of bichri do we more harm than do absalom : take thou thy lord 's servant , and pursue after he , lest he get he fence city , and escape we .
and there go out after he joab 's man , and the cherethites , and the pelethites , and all the mighty man : and they go out of jerusalem , to pursue after sheba the son of bichri .
when they be at the great stone which be in gibeon , amasa go before they .
and joab 's garment that he have put on be gird unto he , and upon it a girdle with a sword fasten upon he loin in the sheath thereof ; and as he go forth it fall out .
and joab say to amasa , art thou in health , my brother ?
and joab take amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss he .
but amasa take no heed to the sword that be in joab 's hand : so he smite he therewith in the fifth rib , and shed out he bowels to the ground , and strike he not again ; and he die .
so joab and abishai he brother pursue after sheba the son of bichri .
and one of joab 's man stand by he , and say , he that favoureth joab , and he that be for david , let he go after joab .
and amasa wallow in blood in the midst of the highway .
and when the man see that all the people stand still , he remove amasa out of the highway into the field , and cast a cloth upon he , when he see that every one that come by he stand still .
when he be remove out of the highway , all the people go on after joab , to pursue after sheba the son of bichri .
and he go through all the tribe of israel unto abel , and to bethmaachah , and all the berites : and they be gather together , and go also after he .
and they come and besiege he in abel of bethmaachah , and they cast up a bank against the city , and it stand in the trench : and all the people that be with joab batter the wall , to throw it down .
then cry a wise woman out of the city , hear , hear ; say , i pray you , unto joab , come near hither , that i may speak with thee .
and when he be come near unto she , the woman say , art thou joab ?
and he answer , i be he .
then she say unto he , hear the word of thine handmaid .
and he answer , i do hear .
then she speak , say , they be wont to speak in old time , say , they shall surely ask counsel at abel : and so they end the matter .
i be one of they that be peaceable and faithful in israel : thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel : why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord ?
and joab answer and say , far be it , far be it from i , that i should swallow up or destroy .
the matter be not so : but a man of mount ephraim , sheba the son of bichri by name , have lift up he hand against the king , even against david : deliver he only , and i will depart from the city .
and the woman say unto joab , behold , he head shall be throw to thee over the wall .
then the woman go unto all the people in she wisdom .
and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri , and cast it out to joab .
and he blow a trumpet , and they retire from the city , every man to he tent .
and joab return to jerusalem unto the king .
now joab be over all the host of israel : and benaiah the son of jehoiada be over the cherethites and over the pelethites :
and adoram be over the tribute : and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud be recorder :
and sheva be scribe : and zadok and abiathar be the priest :
and ira also the jairite be a chief ruler about david .
then there be a famine in the day of david three year , year after year ; and david enquire of the lord .
and the lord answer , it be for saul , and for he bloody house , because he slew the gibeonites .
and the king call the gibeonites , and say unto they ; ( now the gibeonites be not of the child of israel , but of the remnant of the amorites ; and the child of israel have swear unto they : and saul seek to slay they in he zeal to the child of israel and judah . )
wherefore david say unto the gibeonites , what shall i do for you ? and wherewith shall i make the atonement , that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord ?
and the gibeonites say unto he , we will have no silver nor gold of saul , nor of he house ; neither for we shalt thou kill any man in israel .
and he say , what ye shall say , that will i do for you .
and they answer the king , the man that consume we , and that devise against we that we should be destroy from remain in any of the coast of israel ,
let seven man of he son be deliver unto we , and we will hang they up unto the lord in gibeah of saul , whom the lord do choose .
and the king say , i will give they .
but the king spare mephibosheth , the son of jonathan the son of saul , because of the lord 's oath that be between they , between david and jonathan the son of saul .
but the king take the two son of rizpah the daughter of aiah , whom she bare unto saul , armoni and mephibosheth ; and the five son of michal the daughter of saul , whom she bring up for adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite :
and he deliver they into the hand of the gibeonites , and they hang they in the hill before the lord : and they fall all seven together , and be put to death in the day of harvest , in the first day , in the beginning of barley harvest .
and rizpah the daughter of aiah take sackcloth , and spread it for she upon the rock , from the beginning of harvest until water drop upon they out of heaven , and suffer neither the bird of the air to rest on they by day , nor the beast of the field by night .
and it be tell david what rizpah the daughter of aiah , the concubine of saul , have do .
and david go and take the bone of saul and the bone of jonathan he son from the man of jabeshgilead , which have steal they from the street of bethshan , where the philistines have hang they , when the philistines have slay saul in gilboa :
and he bring up from thence the bone of saul and the bone of jonathan he son ; and they gather the bone of they that be hang .
and the bone of saul and jonathan he son bury they in the country of benjamin in zelah , in the sepulchre of kish he father : and they perform all that the king command .
and after that god be intreat for the land .
moreover the philistines have yet war again with israel ; and david go down , and he servant with he , and fight against the philistines : and david wax faint .
and ishbibenob , which be of the son of the giant , the weight of whose spear weigh three hundred shekel of brass in weight , he be gird with a new sword , think to have slay david .
but abishai the son of zeruiah succour he , and smite the philistine , and kill he .
then the man of david sware unto he , say , thou shalt go no more out with we to battle , that thou quench not the light of israel .
and it come to pass after this , that there be again a battle with the philistine at gob : then sibbechai the hushathite slew saph , which be of the son of the giant .
and there be again a battle in gob with the philistines , where elhanan the son of jaareoregim , a bethlehemite , slew the brother of goliath the gittite , the staff of whose spear be like a weaver 's beam .
and there be yet a battle in gath , where be a man of great stature , that have on every hand six finger , and on every foot six toe , four and twenty in number ; and he also be bear to the giant .
and when he defy israel , jonathan the son of shimeah the brother of david slew he .
these four be bear to the giant in gath , and fall by the hand of david , and by the hand of he servant .
and david spake unto the lord the word of this song in the day that the lord have deliver he out of the hand of all he enemy , and out of the hand of saul :
and he say , the lord be my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ;
the god of my rock ; in he will i trust : he be my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge , my saviour ; thou savest i from violence .
i will call on the lord , who be worthy to be praise : so shall i be save from mine enemy .
when the wave of death compass i , the flood of ungodly man make i afraid ;
the sorrow of hell compass i about ; the snare of death prevent i ;
in my distress i call upon the lord , and cry to my god : and he do hear my voice out of he temple , and my cry do enter into he ear .
then the earth shake and tremble ; the foundation of heaven move and shake , because he be wroth .
there go up a smoke out of he nostril , and fire out of he mouth devour : coal be kindle by it .
he bow the heaven also , and come down ; and darkness be under he foot .
and he ride upon a cherub , and do fly : and he be see upon the wing of the wind .
and he make darkness pavilion round about he , dark water , and thick cloud of the sky .
through the brightness before he be coal of fire kindle .
the lord thunder from heaven , and the most high utter he voice .
and he send out arrow , and scatter they ; lightning , and discomfited they .
and the channel of the sea appear , the foundation of the world be discover , at the rebuking of the lord , at the blast of the breath of he nostril .
he send from above , he take i ; he draw i out of many water ;
he deliver i from my strong enemy , and from they that hate i : for they be too strong for i .
they prevent i in the day of my calamity : but the lord be my stay .
he bring i forth also into a large place : he deliver i , because he delight in i .
the lord reward i accord to my righteousness : accord to the cleanness of my hand have he recompense i .
for i have keep the way of the lord , and have not wickedly depart from my god .
for all he judgment be before i : and as for he statute , i do not depart from they .
i be also upright before he , and have keep myself from mine iniquity .
therefore the lord have recompense i accord to my righteousness ; accord to my cleanness in he eye sight .
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful , and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright .
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure ; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury .
and the afflict people thou wilt save : but thine eye be upon the haughty , that thou mayest bring they down .
for thou art my lamp , o lord : and the lord will lighten my darkness .
for by thee i have run through a troop : by my god have i leap over a wall .
as for god , he way be perfect ; the word of the lord be try : he be a buckler to all they that trust in he .
for who be god , save the lord ? and who be a rock , save we god ?
god be my strength and power : and he maketh my way perfect .
he maketh my foot like hind ' foot : and setteth i upon my high place .
he teacheth my hand to war ; so that a bow of steel be break by mine arm .
thou hast also give i the shield of thy salvation : and thy gentleness have make i great .
thou hast enlarged my step under i ; so that my foot do not slip .
i have pursue mine enemy , and destroy they ; and turn not again until i have consume they .
and i have consume they , and wound they , that they could not arise : yea , they be fall under my foot .
for thou hast gird i with strength to battle : they that rise up against i hast thou subdue under i .
thou hast also give i the neck of mine enemy , that i might destroy they that hate i .
they look , but there be none to save ; even unto the lord , but he answer they not .
then do i beat they as small as the dust of the earth , i do stamp they as the mire of the street , and do spread they abroad .
thou also hast deliver i from the striving of my people , thou hast keep i to be head of the heathen : a people which i know not shall serve i .
stranger shall submit themselves unto i : as soon as they hear , they shall be obedient unto i .
stranger shall fade away , and they shall be afraid out of they close place .
the lord liveth ; and bless be my rock ; and exalt be the god of the rock of my salvation .
it be god that avengeth i , and that bringeth down the people under i ,
and that bringeth i forth from mine enemy : thou also hast lift i up on high above they that rise up against i : thou hast deliver i from the violent man .
therefore i will give thanks unto thee , o lord , among the heathen , and i will sing praise unto thy name .
he be the tower of salvation for he king : and sheweth mercy to he anointed , unto david , and to he seed for evermore .
now these be the last word of david .
david the son of jesse say , and the man who be raise up on high , the anointed of the god of jacob , and the sweet psalmist of israel , say ,
the spirit of the lord spake by i , and he word be in my tongue .
the god of israel say , the rock of israel spake to i , he that ruleth over man must be just , ruling in the fear of god .
and he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun riseth , even a morning without cloud ; as the tender grass spring out of the earth by clear shine after rain .
although my house be not so with god ; yet he have make with i a everlasting covenant , order in all thing , and sure : for this be all my salvation , and all my desire , although he make it not to grow .
but the son of belial shall be all of they as thorn thrust away , because they can not be take with hand :
but the man that shall touch they must be fence with iron and the staff of a spear ; and they shall be utterly burn with fire in the same place .
these be the name of the mighty man whom david have : the tachmonite that sit in the seat , chief among the captain ; the same be adino the eznite : he lift up he spear against eight hundred , whom he slew at one time .
and after he be eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite , one of the three mighty man with david , when they defy the philistine that be there gather together to battle , and the man of israel be go away :
he arise , and smite the philistines until he hand be weary , and he hand clave unto the sword : and the lord work a great victory that day ; and the people return after he only to spoil .
and after he be shammah the son of agee the hararite .
and the philistines be gather together into a troop , where be a piece of ground full of lentile : and the people flee from the philistines .
but he stand in the midst of the ground , and defend it , and slew the philistines : and the lord work a great victory .
and three of the thirty chief go down , and come to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam : and the troop of the philistines pitch in the valley of rephaim .
and david be then in a hold , and the garrison of the philistine be then in bethlehem .
and david long , and say , oh that one would give i drink of the water of the well of bethlehem , which be by the gate !
and the three mighty man brake through the host of the philistines , and draw water out of the well of bethlehem , that be by the gate , and take it , and bring it to david : nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but pour it out unto the lord .
and he say , be it far from i , o lord , that i should do this : be not this the blood of the man that go in jeopardy of they life ? therefore he would not drink it .
these thing do these three mighty man .
and abishai , the brother of joab , the son of zeruiah , be chief among three .
and he lift up he spear against three hundred , and slew they , and have the name among three .
be he not most honourable of three ? therefore he be they captain : howbeit he attain not unto the first three .
and benaiah the son of jehoiada , the son of a valiant man , of kabzeel , who have do many act , he slew two lionlike man of moab : he go down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow :
and he slew a egyptian , a goodly man : and the egyptian have a spear in he hand ; but he go down to he with a staff , and pluck the spear out of the egyptian 's hand , and slew he with he own spear .
these thing do benaiah the son of jehoiada , and have the name among three mighty man .
he be more honourable than the thirty , but he attain not to the first three .
and david set he over he guard .
asahel the brother of joab be one of the thirty ; elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem ,
shammah the harodite , elika the harodite ,
helez the paltite , ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite ,
abiezer the anethothite , mebunnai the hushathite ,
zalmon the ahohite , maharai the netophathite ,
heleb the son of baanah , a netophathite , ittai the son of ribai out of gibeah of the child of benjamin ,
benaiah the pirathonite , hiddai of the brook of gaash ,
abialbon the arbathite , azmaveth the barhumite ,
eliahba the shaalbonite , of the son of jashen , jonathan ,
shammah the hararite , ahiam the son of sharar the hararite ,
eliphelet the son of ahasbai , the son of the maachathite , eliam the son of ahithophel the gilonite ,
hezrai the carmelite , paarai the arbite ,
igal the son of nathan of zobah , bani the gadite ,
zelek the ammonite , nahari the beerothite , armourbearer to joab the son of zeruiah ,
ira a ithrite , gareb a ithrite ,
uriah the hittite : thirty and seven in all .
and again the anger of the lord be kindle against israel , and he move david against they to say , go , number israel and judah .
for the king say to joab the captain of the host , which be with he , go now through all the tribe of israel , from dan even to beersheba , and number ye the people , that i may know the number of the people .
and joab say unto the king , now the lord thy god add unto the people , how many soever they be , a hundredfold , and that the eye of my lord the king may see it : but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing ?
notwithstanding the king 's word prevail against joab , and against the captain of the host .
and joab and the captain of the host go out from the presence of the king , to number the people of israel .
and they pass over jordan , and pitch in aroer , on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad , and toward jazer :
then they come to gilead , and to the land of tahtimhodshi ; and they come to danjaan , and about to zidon ,
and come to the strong hold of tyre , and to all the city of the hivites , and of the canaanites : and they go out to the south of judah , even to beersheba .
so when they have go through all the land , they come to jerusalem at the end of nine month and twenty day .
and joab give up the sum of the number of the people unto the king : and there be in israel eight hundred thousand valiant man that draw the sword ; and the man of judah be five hundred thousand man .
and david 's heart smite he after that he have number the people .
and david say unto the lord , i have sin greatly in that i have do : and now , i beseech thee , o lord , take away the iniquity of thy servant ; for i have do very foolishly .
for when david be up in the morning , the word of the lord come unto the prophet gad , david 's seer , say ,
go and say unto david , thus saith the lord , i offer thee three thing ; choose thee one of they , that i may do it unto thee .
so gad come to david , and tell he , and say unto he , shall seven year of famine come unto thee in thy land ? or wilt thou flee three month before thine enemy , while they pursue thee ? or that there be three day ' pestilence in thy land ? now advise , and see what answer i shall return to he that send i .
and david say unto gad , i be in a great strait : let we fall now into the hand of the lord ; for he mercy be great : and let i not fall into the hand of man .
so the lord send a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appoint : and there die of the people from dan even to beersheba seventy thousand man .
and when the angel stretch out he hand upon jerusalem to destroy it , the lord repent he of the evil , and say to the angel that destroy the people , it be enough : stay now thine hand .
and the angel of the lord be by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite .
and david spake unto the lord when he see the angel that smite the people , and say , lo , i have sin , and i have do wickedly : but these sheep , what have they do ? let thine hand , i pray thee , be against i , and against my father 's house .
and gad come that day to david , and say unto he , go up , rear a altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite .
and david , accord to the say of gad , go up as the lord command .
and araunah look , and see the king and he servant come on toward he : and araunah go out , and bow himself before the king on he face upon the ground .
and araunah say , wherefore be my lord the king come to he servant ?
and david say , to buy the threshingfloor of thee , to build a altar unto the lord , that the plague may be stay from the people .
and araunah say unto david , let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto he : behold , here be oxen for burnt sacrifice , and threshing instrument and other instrument of the ox for wood .
all these thing do araunah , as a king , give unto the king .
and araunah say unto the king , the lord thy god accept thee .
and the king say unto araunah , nay ; but i will surely buy it of thee at a price : neither will i offer burnt offering unto the lord my god of that which doth cost i nothing .
so david buy the threshingfloor and the ox for fifty shekel of silver .
and david build there a altar unto the lord , and offer burnt offering and peace offering .
so the lord be intreat for the land , and the plague be stay from israel .
now king david be old and stricken in year ; and they cover he with clothes , but he gat no heat .
wherefore he servant say unto he , let there be seek for my lord the king a young virgin : and let she stand before the king , and let she cherish he , and let she lie in thy bosom , that my lord the king may get heat .
so they seek for a fair damsel throughout all the coast of israel , and find abishag a shunammite , and bring she to the king .
and the damsel be very fair , and cherish the king , and minister to he : but the king know she not .
then adonijah the son of haggith exalt himself , say , i will be king : and he prepare he chariot and horseman , and fifty man to run before he .
and he father have not displeased he at any time in say , why hast thou do so ? and he also be a very goodly man ; and he mother bare he after absalom .
and he confer with joab the son of zeruiah , and with abiathar the priest : and they follow adonijah help he .
but zadok the priest , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and nathan the prophet , and shimei , and rei , and the mighty man which belong to david , be not with adonijah .
and adonijah slew sheep and ox and fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth , which be by enrogel , and call all he brethren the king 's son , and all the man of judah the king 's servant :
but nathan the prophet , and benaiah , and the mighty man , and solomon he brother , he call not .
wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon , say , hast thou not hear that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign , and david we lord knoweth it not ?
now therefore come , let i , i pray thee , give thee counsel , that thou mayest save thine own life , and the life of thy son solomon .
go and get thee in unto king david , and say unto he , didst not thou , my lord , o king , swear unto thine handmaid , say , assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after i , and he shall sit upon my throne ? why then doth adonijah reign ?
behold , while thou yet talkest there with the king , i also will come in after thee , and confirm thy word .
and bathsheba go in unto the king into the chamber : and the king be very old ; and abishag the shunammite minister unto the king .
and bathsheba bow , and do obeisance unto the king .
and the king say , what wouldest thou ?
and she say unto he , my lord , thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid , say , assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after i , and he shall sit upon my throne .
and now , behold , adonijah reigneth ; and now , my lord the king , thou knowest it not :
and he have slay ox and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and have call all the son of the king , and abiathar the priest , and joab the captain of the host : but solomon thy servant have he not call .
and thou , my lord , o king , the eye of all israel be upon thee , that thou shouldest tell they who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after he .
otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord the king shall sleep with he father , that i and my son solomon shall be count offender .
and , lo , while she yet talk with the king , nathan the prophet also come in .
and they tell the king , say , behold nathan the prophet .
and when he be come in before the king , he bow himself before the king with he face to the ground .
and nathan say , my lord , o king , hast thou say , adonijah shall reign after i , and he shall sit upon my throne ?
for he be go down this day , and have slay ox and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and have call all the king 's son , and the captain of the host , and abiathar the priest ; and , behold , they eat and drink before he , and say , god save king adonijah .
but i , even i thy servant , and zadok the priest , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and thy servant solomon , have he not call .
be this thing do by my lord the king , and thou hast not shew it unto thy servant , who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after he ?
then king david answer and say , call i bathsheba .
and she come into the king 's presence , and stand before the king .
and the king sware , and say , as the lord liveth , that have redeem my soul out of all distress ,
even as i sware unto thee by the lord god of israel , say , assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after i , and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead ; even so will i certainly do this day .
then bathsheba bow with she face to the earth , and do reverence to the king , and say , let my lord king david live for ever .
and king david say , call i zadok the priest , and nathan the prophet , and benaiah the son of jehoiada .
and they come before the king .
the king also say unto they , take with you the servant of you lord , and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule , and bring he down to gihon :
and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint he there king over israel : and blow ye with the trumpet , and say , god save king solomon .
then ye shall come up after he , that he may come and sit upon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and i have appoint he to be ruler over israel and over judah .
and benaiah the son of jehoiada answer the king , and say , amen : the lord god of my lord the king say so too .
as the lord have be with my lord the king , even so be he with solomon , and make he throne greater than the throne of my lord king david .
so zadok the priest , and nathan the prophet , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and the cherethites , and the pelethites , go down , and cause solomon to ride upon king david 's mule , and bring he to gihon .
and zadok the priest take a horn of oil out of the tabernacle , and anoint solomon .
and they blow the trumpet ; and all the people say , god save king solomon .
and all the people come up after he , and the people pipe with pipe , and rejoice with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of they .
and adonijah and all the guest that be with he hear it as they have make a end of eating .
and when joab hear the sound of the trumpet , he say , wherefore be this noise of the city be in a uproar ?
and while he yet speak , behold , jonathan the son of abiathar the priest come ; and adonijah say unto he , come in ; for thou art a valiant man , and bringest good tiding .
and jonathan answer and say to adonijah , verily we lord king david have make solomon king .
and the king have send with he zadok the priest , and nathan the prophet , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and the cherethites , and the pelethites , and they have cause he to ride upon the king 's mule :
and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anoint he king in gihon : and they be come up from thence rejoicing , so that the city ring again .
this be the noise that ye have hear .
and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom .
and moreover the king 's servant come to bless we lord king david , say , god make the name of solomon better than thy name , and make he throne greater than thy throne .
and the king bow himself upon the bed .
and also thus say the king , bless be the lord god of israel , which have give one to sit on my throne this day , mine eye even see it .
and all the guest that be with adonijah be afraid , and rise up , and go every man he way .
and adonijah fear because of solomon , and arise , and go , and catch hold on the horn of the altar .
and it be tell solomon , say , behold , adonijah feareth king solomon : for , lo , he have catch hold on the horn of the altar , say , let king solomon swear unto i today that he will not slay he servant with the sword .
and solomon say , if he will shew himself a worthy man , there shall not a hair of he fall to the earth : but if wickedness shall be find in he , he shall die .
so king solomon send , and they bring he down from the altar .
and he come and bow himself to king solomon : and solomon say unto he , go to thine house .
now the day of david draw nigh that he should die ; and he charge solomon he son , say ,
i go the way of all the earth : be thou strong therefore , and shew thyself a man ;
and keep the charge of the lord thy god , to walk in he way , to keep he statute , and he commandment , and he judgment , and he testimony , as it be write in the law of moses , that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest , and whithersoever thou turnest thyself :
that the lord may continue he word which he speak concern i , say , if thy child take heed to they way , to walk before i in truth with all they heart and with all they soul , there shall not fail thee ( say he ) a man on the throne of israel .
moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah do to i , and what he do to the two captain of the host of israel , unto abner the son of ner , and unto amasa the son of jether , whom he slew , and shed the blood of war in peace , and put the blood of war upon he girdle that be about he loin , and in he shoe that be on he foot .
do therefore accord to thy wisdom , and let not he hoar head go down to the grave in peace .
but shew kindness unto the son of barzillai the gileadite , and let they be of those that eat at thy table : for so they come to i when i flee because of absalom thy brother .
and , behold , thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera , a benjamite of bahurim , which curse i with a grievous curse in the day when i go to mahanaim : but he come down to meet i at jordan , and i sware to he by the lord , say , i will not put thee to death with the sword .
now therefore hold he not guiltless : for thou art a wise man , and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto he ; but he hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood .
so david sleep with he father , and be bury in the city of david .
and the day that david reign over israel be forty year : seven year reign he in hebron , and thirty and three year reign he in jerusalem .
then sit solomon upon the throne of david he father ; and he kingdom be establish greatly .
and adonijah the son of haggith come to bathsheba the mother of solomon .
and she say , comest thou peaceably ?
and he say , peaceably .
he say moreover , i have somewhat to say unto thee .
and she say , say on .
and he say , thou knowest that the kingdom be mine , and that all israel set they face on i , that i should reign : howbeit the kingdom be turn about , and be become my brother 's : for it be he from the lord .
and now i ask one petition of thee , deny i not .
and she say unto he , say on .
and he say , speak , i pray thee , unto solomon the king , ( for he will not say thee nay , ) that he give i abishag the shunammite to wife .
and bathsheba say , well ; i will speak for thee unto the king .
bathsheba therefore go unto king solomon , to speak unto he for adonijah .
and the king rise up to meet she , and bow himself unto she , and sit down on he throne , and cause a seat to be set for the king 's mother ; and she sit on he right hand .
then she say , i desire one small petition of thee ; i pray thee , say i not nay .
and the king say unto she , ask on , my mother : for i will not say thee nay .
and she say , let abishag the shunammite be give to adonijah thy brother to wife .
and king solomon answer and say unto he mother , and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ? ask for he the kingdom also ; for he be mine elder brother ; even for he , and for abiathar the priest , and for joab the son of zeruiah .
then king solomon sware by the lord , say , god do so to i , and more also , if adonijah have not speak this word against he own life .
now therefore , as the lord liveth , which have establish i , and set i on the throne of david my father , and who have make i a house , as he promise , adonijah shall be put to death this day .
and king solomon send by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada ; and he fall upon he that he die .
and unto abiathar the priest say the king , get thee to anathoth , unto thine own field ; for thou art worthy of death : but i will not at this time put thee to death , because thou barest the ark of the lord god before david my father , and because thou hast be afflict in all wherein my father be afflict .
so solomon thrust out abiathar from be priest unto the lord ; that he might fulfil the word of the lord , which he speak concern the house of eli in shiloh .
then tiding come to joab : for joab have turn after adonijah , though he turn not after absalom .
and joab flee unto the tabernacle of the lord , and catch hold on the horn of the altar .
and it be tell king solomon that joab be flee unto the tabernacle of the lord ; and , behold , he be by the altar .
then solomon send benaiah the son of jehoiada , say , go , fall upon he .
and benaiah come to the tabernacle of the lord , and say unto he , thus saith the king , come forth .
and he say , nay ; but i will die here .
and benaiah bring the king word again , say , thus say joab , and thus he answer i .
and the king say unto he , do as he have say , and fall upon he , and bury he ; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood , which joab shed , from i , and from the house of my father .
and the lord shall return he blood upon he own head , who fall upon two man more righteous and better than he , and slew they with the sword , my father david not know thereof , to wit , abner the son of ner , captain of the host of israel , and amasa the son of jether , captain of the host of judah .
they blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab , and upon the head of he seed for ever : but upon david , and upon he seed , and upon he house , and upon he throne , shall there be peace for ever from the lord .
so benaiah the son of jehoiada go up , and fall upon he , and slew he : and he be bury in he own house in the wilderness .
and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in he room over the host : and zadok the priest do the king put in the room of abiathar .
and the king send and call for shimei , and say unto he , build thee a house in jerusalem , and dwell there , and go not forth thence any whither .
for it shall be , that on the day thou goest out , and passest over the brook kidron , thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die : thy blood shall be upon thine own head .
and shimei say unto the king , the say be good : as my lord the king have say , so will thy servant do .
and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many day .
and it come to pass at the end of three year , that two of the servant of shimei run away unto achish son of maachah king of gath .
and they tell shimei , say , behold , thy servant be in gath .
and shimei arise , and saddle he ass , and go to gath to achish to seek he servant : and shimei go , and bring he servant from gath .
and it be tell solomon that shimei have go from jerusalem to gath , and be come again .
and the king send and call for shimei , and say unto he , do i not make thee to swear by the lord , and protest unto thee , say , know for a certain , on the day thou goest out , and walkest abroad any whither , that thou shalt surely die ? and thou saidst unto i , the word that i have hear be good .
why then hast thou not keep the oath of the lord , and the commandment that i have charge thee with ?
the king say moreover to shimei , thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart be privy to , that thou didst to david my father : therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head ;
and king solomon shall be bless , and the throne of david shall be establish before the lord for ever .
so the king command benaiah the son of jehoiada ; which go out , and fall upon he , that he die .
and the kingdom be establish in the hand of solomon .
and solomon make affinity with pharaoh king of egypt , and take pharaoh 's daughter , and bring she into the city of david , until he have make a end of build he own house , and the house of the lord , and the wall of jerusalem round about .
only the people sacrifice in high place , because there be no house build unto the name of the lord , until those day .
and solomon love the lord , walk in the statute of david he father : only he sacrifice and burnt incense in high place .
and the king go to gibeon to sacrifice there ; for that be the great high place : a thousand burnt offering do solomon offer upon that altar .
in gibeon the lord appear to solomon in a dream by night : and god say , ask what i shall give thee .
and solomon say , thou hast shew unto thy servant david my father great mercy , accord as he walk before thee in truth , and in righteousness , and in uprightness of heart with thee ; and thou hast keep for he this great kindness , that thou hast give he a son to sit on he throne , as it be this day .
and now , o lord my god , thou hast make thy servant king instead of david my father : and i be but a little child : i know not how to go out or come in .
and thy servant be in the midst of thy people which thou hast choose , a great people , that can not be number nor count for multitude .
give therefore thy servant a understanding heart to judge thy people , that i may discern between good and bad : for who be able to judge this thy so great a people ?
and the speech please the lord , that solomon have ask this thing .
and god say unto he , because thou hast ask this thing , and hast not ask for thyself long life ; neither hast ask riches for thyself , nor hast ask the life of thine enemy ; but hast ask for thyself understanding to discern judgment ;
behold , i have do accord to thy word : lo , i have give thee a wise and a understanding heart ; so that there be none like thee before thee , neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee .
and i have also give thee that which thou hast not ask , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the king like unto thee all thy day .
and if thou wilt walk in my way , to keep my statute and my commandment , as thy father david do walk , then i will lengthen thy day .
and solomon awake ; and , behold , it be a dream .
and he come to jerusalem , and stand before the ark of the covenant of the lord , and offer up burnt offering , and offer peace offering , and make a feast to all he servant .
then come there two woman , that be harlot , unto the king , and stand before he .
and the one woman say , o my lord , i and this woman dwell in one house ; and i be deliver of a child with she in the house .
and it come to pass the third day after that i be deliver , that this woman be deliver also : and we be together ; there be no stranger with we in the house , save we two in the house .
and this woman 's child die in the night ; because she overlay it .
and she arise at midnight , and take my son from beside i , while thine handmaid sleep , and lay it in she bosom , and lay she dead child in my bosom .
and when i rise in the morning to give my child suck , behold , it be dead : but when i have consider it in the morning , behold , it be not my son , which i do bear .
and the other woman say , nay ; but the living be my son , and the dead be thy son .
and this say , no ; but the dead be thy son , and the living be my son .
thus they speak before the king .
then say the king , the one saith , this be my son that liveth , and thy son be the dead : and the other saith , nay ; but thy son be the dead , and my son be the living .
and the king say , bring i a sword .
and they bring a sword before the king .
and the king say , divide the living child in two , and give half to the one , and half to the other .
then speak the woman whose the living child be unto the king , for she bowels yearn upon she son , and she say , o my lord , give she the living child , and in no wise slay it .
but the other say , let it be neither mine nor thine , but divide it .
then the king answer and say , give she the living child , and in no wise slay it : she be the mother thereof .
and all israel hear of the judgment which the king have judge ; and they fear the king : for they see that the wisdom of god be in he , to do judgment .
so king solomon be king over all israel .
and these be the prince which he have ; azariah the son of zadok the priest ,
elihoreph and ahiah , the son of shisha , scribe ; jehoshaphat the son of ahilud , the recorder .
and benaiah the son of jehoiada be over the host : and zadok and abiathar be the priest :
and azariah the son of nathan be over the officer : and zabud the son of nathan be principal officer , and the king 's friend :
and ahishar be over the household : and adoniram the son of abda be over the tribute .
and solomon have twelve officer over all israel , which provide victuals for the king and he household : each man he month in a year make provision .
and these be they name : the son of hur , in mount ephraim :
the son of dekar , in makaz , and in shaalbim , and bethshemesh , and elonbethhanan :
the son of hesed , in aruboth ; to he pertain sochoh , and all the land of hepher :

baanah the son of hushai be in asher and in aloth :
jehoshaphat the son of paruah , in issachar :
shimei the son of elah , in benjamin :
geber the son of uri be in the country of gilead , in the country of sihon king of the amorites , and of og king of bashan ; and he be the only officer which be in the land .
judah and israel be many , as the sand which be by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking , and make merry .
and solomon reign over all kingdom from the river unto the land of the philistines , and unto the border of egypt : they bring present , and serve solomon all the day of he life .
and solomon 's provision for one day be thirty measure of fine flour , and threescore measure of meal ,
ten fat ox , and twenty ox out of the pasture , and a hundred sheep , beside hart , and roebuck , and fallowdeer , and fat fowl .
for he have dominion over all the region on this side the river , from tiphsah even to azzah , over all the king on this side the river : and he have peace on all side round about he .
and judah and israel dwell safely , every man under he vine and under he fig tree , from dan even to beersheba , all the day of solomon .
and solomon have forty thousand stall of horse for he chariot , and twelve thousand horseman .
and those officer provide victual for king solomon , and for all that come unto king solomon 's table , every man in he month : they lack nothing .
barley also and straw for the horse and dromedary bring they unto the place where the officer be , every man accord to he charge .
and god give solomon wisdom and understanding exceed much , and largeness of heart , even as the sand that be on the sea shore .
and solomon 's wisdom excel the wisdom of all the child of the east country , and all the wisdom of egypt .
for he be wiser than all man ; than ethan the ezrahite , and heman , and chalcol , and darda , the son of mahol : and he fame be in all nation round about .
and he speak three thousand proverb : and he song be a thousand and five .
and he spake of tree , from the cedar tree that be in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall : he speak also of beast , and of fowl , and of creep thing , and of fish .
and there come of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon , from all king of the earth , which have hear of he wisdom .
and hiram king of tyre send he servant unto solomon ; for he have hear that they have anoint he king in the room of he father : for hiram be ever a lover of david .
and solomon send to hiram , say ,
thou knowest how that david my father could not build a house unto the name of the lord he god for the war which be about he on every side , until the lord put they under the sole of he foot .
but now the lord my god have give i rest on every side , so that there be neither adversary nor evil occurrent .
and , behold , i purpose to build a house unto the name of the lord my god , as the lord spake unto david my father , say , thy son , whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room , he shall build a house unto my name .
now therefore command thou that they hew i cedar tree out of lebanon ; and my servant shall be with thy servant : and unto thee will i give hire for thy servant accord to all that thou shalt appoint : for thou knowest that there be not among we any that can skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians .
and it come to pass , when hiram hear the word of solomon , that he rejoice greatly , and say , blessed be the lord this day , which have give unto david a wise son over this great people .
and hiram send to solomon , say , i have consider the thing which thou sentest to i for : and i will do all thy desire concern timber of cedar , and concern timber of fir .
my servant shall bring they down from lebanon unto the sea : and i will convey they by sea in float unto the place that thou shalt appoint i , and will cause they to be discharge there , and thou shalt receive they : and thou shalt accomplish my desire , in give food for my household .
so hiram give solomon cedar tree and fir tree accord to all he desire .
and solomon give hiram twenty thousand measure of wheat for food to he household , and twenty measure of pure oil : thus give solomon to hiram year by year .
and the lord give solomon wisdom , as he promise he : and there be peace between hiram and solomon ; and they two make a league together .
and king solomon raise a levy out of all israel ; and the levy be thirty thousand man .
and he send they to lebanon , ten thousand a month by course : a month they be in lebanon , and two month at home : and adoniram be over the levy .
and solomon have threescore and ten thousand that bare burden , and fourscore thousand hewer in the mountain ;
beside the chief of solomon 's officer which be over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which rule over the people that work in the work .
and the king command , and they bring great stone , costly stone , and hew stone , to lay the foundation of the house .
and solomon 's builder and hiram 's builder do hew they , and the stonesquarer : so they prepare timber and stone to build the house .
and it come to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the child of israel be come out of the land of egypt , in the fourth year of solomon 's reign over israel , in the month zif , which be the second month , that he begin to build the house of the lord .
and the house which king solomon build for the lord , the length thereof be threescore cubit , and the breadth thereof twenty cubit , and the height thereof thirty cubit .
and the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubit be the length thereof , accord to the breadth of the house ; and ten cubit be the breadth thereof before the house .
and for the house he make window of narrow light .
and against the wall of the house he build chamber round about , against the wall of the house round about , both of the temple and of the oracle : and he make chamber round about :
the nethermost chamber be five cubit broad , and the middle be six cubit broad , and the third be seven cubit broad : for without in the wall of the house he make narrow rest round about , that the beam should not be fasten in the wall of the house .
and the house , when it be in building , be build of stone make ready before it be bring thither : so that there be neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron hear in the house , while it be in building .
the door for the middle chamber be in the right side of the house : and they go up with wind stair into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
so he build the house , and finish it ; and cover the house with beam and board of cedar .
and then he build chamber against all the house , five cubit high : and they rest on the house with timber of cedar .
and the word of the lord come to solomon , say ,

and the whole house he overlay with gold , until he have finish all the house : also the whole altar that be by the oracle he overlay with gold .
and within the oracle he make two cherubim of olive tree , each ten cubit high .

and the other cherub be ten cubit : both the cherubim be of one measure and one size .
the height of the one cherub be ten cubit , and so be it of the other cherub .
and he set the cherubim within the inner house : and they stretch forth the wing of the cherubim , so that the wing of the one touch the one wall , and the wing of the other cherub touch the other wall ; and they wing touch one another in the midst of the house .
and he overlay the cherubim with gold .
and he carve all the wall of the house round about with carve figure of cherubim and palm tree and open flower , within and without .
and the floor of the house he overlay with gold , within and without .
and for the enter of the oracle he make door of olive tree : the lintel and side post be a fifth part of the wall .

so also make he for the door of the temple post of olive tree , a fourth part of the wall .
and the two door be of fir tree : the two leaf of the one door be folding , and the two leaf of the other door be folding .
and he carve thereon cherubim and palm tree and open flower : and cover they with gold fit upon the carve work .
and he build the inner court with three row of hew stone , and a row of cedar beam .
in the fourth year be the foundation of the house of the lord lay , in the month zif :
and in the eleventh year , in the month bul , which be the eighth month , be the house finish throughout all the part thereof , and accord to all the fashion of it .

and it be cover with cedar above upon the beam , that lay on forty five pillar , fifteen in a row .

and he make a porch of pillar ; the length thereof be fifty cubit , and the breadth thereof thirty cubit : and the porch be before they : and the other pillar and the thick beam be before they .
then he make a porch for the throne where he might judge , even the porch of judgment : and it be cover with cedar from one side of the floor to the other .
and he house where he dwell have another court within the porch , which be of the like work .

and above be costly stone , after the measure of hew stone , and cedar .
and the great court round about be with three row of hew stone , and a row of cedar beam , both for the inner court of the house of the lord , and for the porch of the house .
and king solomon send and fetch hiram out of tyre .
he be a widow 's son of the tribe of naphtali , and he father be a man of tyre , a worker in brass : and he be fill with wisdom , and understanding , and cunning to work all work in brass .
and he come to king solomon , and work all he work .
for he cast two pillar of brass , of eighteen cubit high apiece : and a line of twelve cubit do compass either of they about .
and he make two chapiter of molten brass , to set upon the top of the pillar : the height of the one chapiter be five cubit , and the height of the other chapiter be five cubit :
and net of checker work , and wreath of chain work , for the chapiter which be upon the top of the pillar ; seven for the one chapiter , and seven for the other chapiter .
and he make the pillar , and two row round about upon the one network , to cover the chapiter that be upon the top , with pomegranate : and so do he for the other chapiter .
and the chapiter that be upon the top of the pillar be of lily work in the porch , four cubit .
and the chapiter upon the two pillar have pomegranate also above , over against the belly which be by the network : and the pomegranate be two hundred in row round about upon the other chapiter .
and he set up the pillar in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and call the name thereof jachin : and he set up the left pillar , and call the name thereof boaz .
and upon the top of the pillar be lily work : so be the work of the pillar finish .
and he make a molten sea , ten cubit from the one brim to the other : it be round all about , and he height be five cubit : and a line of thirty cubit do compass it round about .
and under the brim of it round about there be knop compass it , ten in a cubit , compass the sea round about : the knop be cast in two row , when it be cast .
it stand upon twelve ox , three look toward the north , and three look toward the west , and three look toward the south , and three look toward the east : and the sea be set above upon they , and all they hinder part be inward .
and it be a hand breadth thick , and the brim thereof be work like the brim of a cup , with flower of lily : it contain two thousand bath .
and he make ten basis of brass ; four cubit be the length of one base , and four cubit the breadth thereof , and three cubit the height of it .
and the work of the basis be on this manner : they have border , and the border be between the ledge :
and on the border that be between the ledge be lion , ox , and cherubim : and upon the ledge there be a base above : and beneath the lion and ox be certain addition make of thin work .
and every base have four brasen wheel , and plate of brass : and the four corner thereof have undersetter : under the laver be undersetter molten , at the side of every addition .
and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above be a cubit : but the mouth thereof be round after the work of the base , a cubit and a half : and also upon the mouth of it be graving with they border , foursquare , not round .
and under the border be four wheel ; and the axletree of the wheel be join to the base : and the height of a wheel be a cubit and half a cubit .
and the work of the wheel be like the work of a chariot wheel : they axletree , and they nave , and they felloe , and they spoke , be all molten .
and there be four undersetter to the four corner of one base : and the undersetter be of the very base itself .
and in the top of the base be there a round compass of half a cubit high : and on the top of the base the ledge thereof and the border thereof be of the same .
for on the plate of the ledge thereof , and on the border thereof , he grave cherubim , lion , and palm tree , accord to the proportion of every one , and addition round about .
after this manner he make the ten basis : all of they have one casting , one measure , and one size .
then make he ten laver of brass : one laver contain forty bath : and every laver be four cubit : and upon every one of the ten basis one laver .
and he put five basis on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
and hiram make the laver , and the shovel , and the bason .
so hiram make a end of do all the work that he make king solomon for the house of the lord :

and four hundred pomegranate for the two network , even two row of pomegranate for one network , to cover the two bowl of the chapiter that be upon the pillar ;
and the ten basis , and ten laver on the basis ;
and one sea , and twelve ox under the sea ;
and the pot , and the shovel , and the bason : and all these vessel , which hiram make to king solomon for the house of the lord , be of bright brass .
in the plain of jordan do the king cast they , in the clay ground between succoth and zarthan .
and solomon leave all the vessel unweighed , because they be exceed many : neither be the weight of the brass find out .
and solomon make all the vessel that pertain unto the house of the lord : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , whereupon the shewbread be ,
and the candlestick of pure gold , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the oracle , with the flower , and the lamp , and the tong of gold ,
and the bowl , and the snuffer , and the bason , and the spoon , and the censer of pure gold ; and the hinge of gold , both for the door of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the door of the house , to wit , of the temple .
so be end all the work that king solomon make for the house of the lord .
and solomon bring in the thing which david he father have dedicate ; even the silver , and the gold , and the vessel , do he put among the treasure of the house of the lord .
then solomon assemble the elder of israel , and all the head of the tribe , the chief of the father of the child of israel , unto king solomon in jerusalem , that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david , which be zion .
and all the man of israel assemble themselves unto king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim , which be the seventh month .
and all the elder of israel come , and the priest take up the ark .
and they bring up the ark of the lord , and the tabernacle of the congregation , and all the holy vessel that be in the tabernacle , even those do the priest and the levites bring up .
and king solomon , and all the congregation of israel , that be assemble unto he , be with he before the ark , sacrifice sheep and ox , that could not be tell nor number for multitude .
and the priest bring in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto he place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wing of the cherubim .
for the cherubim spread forth they two wing over the place of the ark , and the cherubim cover the ark and the stave thereof above .
and they draw out the stave , that the end of the stave be see out in the holy place before the oracle , and they be not see without : and there they be unto this day .
there be nothing in the ark save the two table of stone , which mose put there at horeb , when the lord make a covenant with the child of israel , when they come out of the land of egypt .
and it come to pass , when the priest be come out of the holy place , that the cloud fill the house of the lord ,
so that the priest could not stand to minister because of the cloud : for the glory of the lord have fill the house of the lord .
then speak solomon , the lord say that he would dwell in the thick darkness .
i have surely build thee a house to dwell in , a settle place for thee to abide in for ever .
and the king turn he face about , and bless all the congregation of israel : ( and all the congregation of israel stand ; )
and he say , blessed be the lord god of israel , which speak with he mouth unto david my father , and have with he hand fulfil it , say ,
since the day that i bring forth my people israel out of egypt , i choose no city out of all the tribe of israel to build a house , that my name might be therein ; but i choose david to be over my people israel .
and it be in the heart of david my father to build a house for the name of the lord god of israel .
and the lord say unto david my father , whereas it be in thine heart to build a house unto my name , thou didst well that it be in thine heart .
nevertheless thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loin , he shall build the house unto my name .
and the lord have perform he word that he speak , and i be rise up in the room of david my father , and sit on the throne of israel , as the lord promise , and have build a house for the name of the lord god of israel .
and i have set there a place for the ark , wherein be the covenant of the lord , which he make with we father , when he bring they out of the land of egypt .
and solomon stand before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel , and spread forth he hand toward heaven :
and he say , lord god of israel , there be no god like thee , in heaven above , or on earth beneath , who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servant that walk before thee with all they heart :
who hast keep with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst he : thou spakest also with thy mouth , and hast fulfil it with thine hand , as it be this day .
therefore now , lord god of israel , keep with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst he , say , there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel ; so that thy child take heed to they way , that they walk before i as thou hast walk before i .
and now , o god of israel , let thy word , i pray thee , be verify , which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father .
but will god indeed dwell on the earth ? behold , the heaven and heaven of heaven can not contain thee ; how much less this house that i have build ?
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant , and to he supplication , o lord my god , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer , which thy servant prayeth before thee to day :
that thine eye may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which thou hast say , my name shall be there : that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place .
and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant , and of thy people israel , when they shall pray toward this place : and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place : and when thou hearest , forgive .
if any man trespass against he neighbour , and a oath be lay upon he to cause he to swear , and the oath come before thine altar in this house :
then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge thy servant , condemn the wicked , to bring he way upon he head ; and justify the righteous , to give he accord to he righteousness .
when thy people israel be smite down before the enemy , because they have sin against thee , and shall turn again to thee , and confess thy name , and pray , and make supplication unto thee in this house :
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy people israel , and bring they again unto the land which thou gavest unto they father .
when heaven be shut up , and there be no rain , because they have sin against thee ; if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from they sin , when thou afflictest they :
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servant , and of thy people israel , that thou teach they the good way wherein they should walk , and give rain upon thy land , which thou hast give to thy people for a inheritance .
if there be in the land famine , if there be pestilence , blast , mildew , locust , or if there be caterpiller ; if they enemy besiege they in the land of they city ; whatsoever plague , whatsoever sickness there be ;
what prayer and supplication soever be make by any man , or by all thy people israel , which shall know every man the plague of he own heart , and spread forth he hand toward this house :
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man accord to he way , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou , even thou only , knowest the heart of all the child of man ; )
that they may fear thee all the day that they live in the land which thou gavest unto we father .
moreover concern a stranger , that be not of thy people israel , but cometh out of a far country for thy name 's sake ;
( for they shall hear of thy great name , and of thy strong hand , and of thy stretch out arm ; ) when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place , and do accord to all that the stranger calleth to thee for : that all people of the earth may know thy name , to fear thee , as do thy people israel ; and that they may know that this house , which i have build , be call by thy name .
if thy people go out to battle against they enemy , whithersoever thou shalt send they , and shall pray unto the lord toward the city which thou hast choose , and toward the house that i have build for thy name :
then hear thou in heaven they prayer and they supplication , and maintain they cause .
if they sin against thee , ( for there be no man that sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with they , and deliver they to the enemy , so that they carry they away captive unto the land of the enemy , far or near ;
yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they be carry captive , and repent , and make supplication unto thee in the land of they that carry they captive , say , we have sin , and have do perversely , we have commit wickedness ;
and so return unto thee with all they heart , and with all they soul , in the land of they enemy , which lead they away captive , and pray unto thee toward they land , which thou gavest unto they father , the city which thou hast choose , and the house which i have build for thy name :
then hear thou they prayer and they supplication in heaven thy dwelling place , and maintain they cause ,
and forgive thy people that have sin against thee , and all they transgression wherein they have transgress against thee , and give they compassion before they who carry they captive , that they may have compassion on they :
for they be thy people , and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest forth out of egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron :
that thine eye may be open unto the supplication of thy servant , and unto the supplication of thy people israel , to hearken unto they in all that they call for unto thee .
for thou didst separate they from among all the people of the earth , to be thine inheritance , as thou spakest by the hand of moses thy servant , when thou broughtest we father out of egypt , o lord god .
and it be so , that when solomon have make a end of pray all this prayer and supplication unto the lord , he arise from before the altar of the lord , from kneel on he knee with he hand spread up to heaven .
and he stand , and bless all the congregation of israel with a loud voice , say ,
bless be the lord , that have give rest unto he people israel , accord to all that he promise : there have not fail one word of all he good promise , which he promise by the hand of moses he servant .
the lord we god be with we , as he be with we father : let he not leave we , nor forsake we :
that he may incline we heart unto he , to walk in all he way , and to keep he commandment , and he statute , and he judgment , which he command we father .
and let these my word , wherewith i have make supplication before the lord , be nigh unto the lord we god day and night , that he maintain the cause of he servant , and the cause of he people israel at all time , as the matter shall require :
that all the people of the earth may know that the lord be god , and that there be none else .
let you heart therefore be perfect with the lord we god , to walk in he statute , and to keep he commandment , as at this day .
and the king , and all israel with he , offer sacrifice before the lord .
and solomon offer a sacrifice of peace offering , which he offer unto the lord , two and twenty thousand ox , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep .
so the king and all the child of israel dedicate the house of the lord .
the same day do the king hallow the middle of the court that be before the house of the lord : for there he offer burnt offering , and meat offering , and the fat of the peace offering : because the brasen altar that be before the lord be too little to receive the burnt offering , and meat offering , and the fat of the peace offering .
and at that time solomon hold a feast , and all israel with he , a great congregation , from the enter in of hamath unto the river of egypt , before the lord we god , seven day and seven day , even fourteen day .
on the eighth day he send the people away : and they bless the king , and go unto they tent joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord have do for david he servant , and for israel he people .
and it come to pass , when solomon have finish the building of the house of the lord , and the king 's house , and all solomon 's desire which he be please to do ,
that the lord appear to solomon the second time , as he have appear unto he at gibeon .
and the lord say unto he , i have hear thy prayer and thy supplication , that thou hast make before i : i have hallowed this house , which thou hast build , to put my name there for ever ; and mine eye and mine heart shall be there perpetually .
and if thou wilt walk before i , as david thy father walk , in integrity of heart , and in uprightness , to do accord to all that i have command thee , and wilt keep my statute and my judgment :
then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever , as i promise to david thy father , say , there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel .
but if ye shall at all turn from follow i , ye or you child , and will not keep my commandment and my statute which i have set before you , but go and serve other god , and worship they :
then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have give they ; and this house , which i have hallowed for my name , will i cast out of my sight ; and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people :
and at this house , which be high , every one that passeth by it shall be astonish , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , why have the lord do thus unto this land , and to this house ?
and they shall answer , because they forsake the lord they god , who bring forth they father out of the land of egypt , and have take hold upon other god , and have worship they , and serve they : therefore have the lord bring upon they all this evil .
and it come to pass at the end of twenty year , when solomon have build the two house , the house of the lord , and the king 's house ,
( now hiram the king of tyre have furnish solomon with cedar tree and fir tree , and with gold , accord to all he desire , ) that then king solomon give hiram twenty city in the land of galilee .
and hiram come out from tyre to see the city which solomon have give he ; and they please he not .
and he say , what city be these which thou hast give i , my brother ?
and he call they the land of cabul unto this day .
and hiram send to the king sixscore talent of gold .
and this be the reason of the levy which king solomon raise ; for to build the house of the lord , and he own house , and millo , and the wall of jerusalem , and hazor , and megiddo , and gezer .
for pharaoh king of egypt have go up , and take gezer , and burn it with fire , and slay the canaanites that dwell in the city , and give it for a present unto he daughter , solomon 's wife .
and solomon build gezer , and bethhoron the nether ,
and baalath , and tadmor in the wilderness , in the land ,
and all the city of store that solomon have , and city for he chariot , and city for he horseman , and that which solomon desire to build in jerusalem , and in lebanon , and in all the land of he dominion .
and all the people that be leave of the amorites , hittites , perizzites , hivites , and jebusites , which be not of the child of israel ,
they child that be leave after they in the land , whom the child of israel also be not able utterly to destroy , upon those do solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day .
but of the child of israel do solomon make no bondman : but they be man of war , and he servant , and he prince , and he captain , and ruler of he chariot , and he horseman .
these be the chief of the officer that be over solomon 's work , five hundred and fifty , which bare rule over the people that work in the work .
but pharaoh 's daughter come up out of the city of david unto she house which solomon have build for she : then do he build millo .
and three time in a year do solomon offer burnt offering and peace offering upon the altar which he build unto the lord , and he burnt incense upon the altar that be before the lord .
so he finish the house .
and king solomon make a navy of ship in eziongeber , which be beside eloth , on the shore of the red sea , in the land of edom .
and hiram send in the navy he servant , shipman that have knowledge of the sea , with the servant of solomon .
and they come to ophir , and fetch from thence gold , four hundred and twenty talent , and bring it to king solomon .
and when the queen of sheba hear of the fame of solomon concern the name of the lord , she come to prove he with hard question .
and she come to jerusalem with a very great train , with camel that bare spice , and very much gold , and precious stone : and when she be come to solomon , she commune with he of all that be in she heart .
and solomon tell she all she question : there be not any thing hide from the king , which he tell she not .
and when the queen of sheba have see all solomon 's wisdom , and the house that he have build ,
and the meat of he table , and the sit of he servant , and the attendance of he minister , and they apparel , and he cupbearer , and he ascent by which he go up unto the house of the lord ; there be no more spirit in she .
and she say to the king , it be a true report that i hear in mine own land of thy act and of thy wisdom .
howbeit i believe not the word , until i come , and mine eye have see it : and , behold , the half be not tell i : thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i hear .
happy be thy man , happy be these thy servant , which stand continually before thee , and that hear thy wisdom .
bless be the lord thy god , which delight in thee , to set thee on the throne of israel : because the lord love israel for ever , therefore make he thee king , to do judgment and justice .
and she give the king a hundred and twenty talent of gold , and of spice very great store , and precious stone : there come no more such abundance of spice as these which the queen of sheba give to king solomon .
and the navy also of hiram , that bring gold from ophir , bring in from ophir great plenty of almug tree , and precious stone .
and the king make of the almug tree pillar for the house of the lord , and for the king 's house , harp also and psaltery for singer : there come no such almug tree , nor be see unto this day .
and king solomon give unto the queen of sheba all she desire , whatsoever she ask , beside that which solomon give she of he royal bounty .
so she turn and go to she own country , she and she servant .
now the weight of gold that come to solomon in one year be six hundred threescore and six talent of gold ,
beside that he have of the merchantman , and of the traffick of the spice merchant , and of all the king of arabia , and of the governor of the country .
and king solomon make two hundred target of beaten gold : six hundred shekel of gold go to one target .
and he make three hundred shield of beaten gold ; three pound of gold go to one shield : and the king put they in the house of the forest of lebanon .
moreover the king make a great throne of ivory , and overlay it with the best gold .
the throne have six step , and the top of the throne be round behind : and there be stay on either side on the place of the seat , and two lion stand beside the stay .
and twelve lion stand there on the one side and on the other upon the six step : there be not the like make in any kingdom .
and all king solomon 's drinking vessel be of gold , and all the vessel of the house of the forest of lebanon be of pure gold ; none be of silver : it be nothing account of in the day of solomon .
for the king have at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram : once in three year come the navy of tharshish , bring gold , and silver , ivory , and ape , and peacock .
so king solomon exceed all the king of the earth for riches and for wisdom .
and all the earth seek to solomon , to hear he wisdom , which god have put in he heart .
and they bring every man he present , vessel of silver , and vessel of gold , and garment , and armour , and spice , horse , and mule , a rate year by year .
and solomon gather together chariot and horseman : and he have a thousand and four hundred chariot , and twelve thousand horseman , whom he bestow in the city for chariot , and with the king at jerusalem .
and the king make silver to be in jerusalem as stone , and cedar make he to be as the sycomore tree that be in the vale , for abundance .
and solomon have horse bring out of egypt , and linen yarn : the king 's merchant receive the linen yarn at a price .
and a chariot come up and go out of egypt for six hundred shekel of silver , and a horse for a hundred and fifty : and so for all the king of the hittites , and for the king of syria , do they bring they out by they means .
but king solomon love many strange woman , together with the daughter of pharaoh , woman of the moabites , ammonites , edomites , zidonians , and hittites ;
of the nation concern which the lord say unto the child of israel , ye shall not go in to they , neither shall they come in unto you : for surely they will turn away you heart after they god : solomon clave unto these in love .
and he have seven hundred wife , princess , and three hundred concubine : and he wife turn away he heart .
for it come to pass , when solomon be old , that he wife turn away he heart after other god : and he heart be not perfect with the lord he god , as be the heart of david he father .
for solomon go after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians , and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites .
and solomon do evil in the sight of the lord , and go not fully after the lord , as do david he father .
then do solomon build a high place for chemosh , the abomination of moab , in the hill that be before jerusalem , and for molech , the abomination of the child of ammon .
and likewise do he for all he strange wife , which burnt incense and sacrifice unto they god .
and the lord be angry with solomon , because he heart be turn from the lord god of israel , which have appear unto he twice ,
and have command he concern this thing , that he should not go after other god : but he keep not that which the lord command .
wherefore the lord say unto solomon , forasmuch as this be do of thee , and thou hast not keep my covenant and my statute , which i have command thee , i will surely rend the kingdom from thee , and will give it to thy servant .
notwithstanding in thy day i will not do it for david thy father 's sake : but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son .
howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom ; but will give one tribe to thy son for david my servant 's sake , and for jerusalem 's sake which i have choose .
and the lord stir up a adversary unto solomon , hadad the edomite : he be of the king 's seed in edom .
for it come to pass , when david be in edom , and joab the captain of the host be go up to bury the slay , after he have smite every male in edom ;
( for six month do joab remain there with all israel , until he have cut off every male in edom : )
that hadad flee , he and certain edomite of he father 's servant with he , to go into egypt ; hadad be yet a little child .
and they arise out of midian , and come to paran : and they take man with they out of paran , and they come to egypt , unto pharaoh king of egypt ; which give he a house , and appoint he victuals , and give he land .
and hadad find great favour in the sight of pharaoh , so that he give he to wife the sister of he own wife , the sister of tahpenes the queen .
and the sister of tahpenes bare he genubath he son , whom tahpene wean in pharaoh 's house : and genubath be in pharaoh 's household among the son of pharaoh .
and when hadad hear in egypt that david sleep with he father , and that joab the captain of the host be dead , hadad say to pharaoh , let i depart , that i may go to mine own country .
then pharaoh say unto he , but what hast thou lack with i , that , behold , thou seekest to go to thine own country ?
and he answer , nothing : howbeit let i go in any wise .
and god stir he up another adversary , rezon the son of eliadah , which flee from he lord hadadezer king of zobah :
and he gather man unto he , and become captain over a band , when david slew they of zobah : and they go to damascus , and dwelt therein , and reign in damascus .
and he be a adversary to israel all the day of solomon , beside the mischief that hadad do : and he abhor israel , and reign over syria .
and jeroboam the son of nebat , a ephrathite of zereda , solomon 's servant , whose mother 's name be zeruah , a widow woman , even he lift up he hand against the king .
and this be the cause that he lift up he hand against the king : solomon build millo , and repair the breach of the city of david he father .
and the man jeroboam be a mighty man of valour : and solomon see the young man that he be industrious , he make he ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph .
and it come to pass at that time when jeroboam go out of jerusalem , that the prophet ahijah the shilonite find he in the way ; and he have clothe himself with a new garment ; and they two be alone in the field :
and ahijah catch the new garment that be on he , and rent it in twelve piece :
and he say to jeroboam , take thee ten piece : for thus saith the lord , the god of israel , behold , i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon , and will give ten tribe to thee :
( but he shall have one tribe for my servant david 's sake , and for jerusalem 's sake , the city which i have choose out of all the tribe of israel : )
because that they have forsake i , and have worship ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians , chemosh the god of the moabites , and milcom the god of the child of ammon , and have not walk in my way , to do that which be right in mine eye , and to keep my statute and my judgment , as do david he father .
howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of he hand : but i will make he prince all the day of he life for david my servant 's sake , whom i choose , because he keep my commandment and my statute :
but i will take the kingdom out of he son 's hand , and will give it unto thee , even ten tribe .
and unto he son will i give one tribe , that david my servant may have a light alway before i in jerusalem , the city which i have choose i to put my name there .
and i will take thee , and thou shalt reign accord to all that thy soul desireth , and shalt be king over israel .
and it shall be , if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee , and wilt walk in my way , and do that be right in my sight , to keep my statute and my commandment , as david my servant do ; that i will be with thee , and build thee a sure house , as i build for david , and will give israel unto thee .
and i will for this afflict the seed of david , but not for ever .
solomon seek therefore to kill jeroboam .
and jeroboam arise , and flee into egypt , unto shishak king of egypt , and be in egypt until the death of solomon .
and the rest of the act of solomon , and all that he do , and he wisdom , be they not write in the book of the act of solomon ?
and the time that solomon reign in jerusalem over all israel be forty year .
and solomon sleep with he father , and be bury in the city of david he father : and rehoboam he son reign in he stead .
and rehoboam go to shechem : for all israel be come to shechem to make he king .
and it come to pass , when jeroboam the son of nebat , who be yet in egypt , hear of it , ( for he be flee from the presence of king solomon , and jeroboam dwelt in egypt ; )
that they send and call he .
and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel come , and spake unto rehoboam , say ,
thy father make we yoke grievous : now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father , and he heavy yoke which he put upon we , lighter , and we will serve thee .
and he say unto they , depart yet for three day , then come again to i .
and the people depart .
and king rehoboam consult with the old man , that stand before solomon he father while he yet live , and say , how do ye advise that i may answer this people ?
and they speak unto he , say , if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day , and wilt serve they , and answer they , and speak good word to they , then they will be thy servant for ever .
but he forsake the counsel of the old man , which they have give he , and consult with the young man that be grow up with he , and which stand before he :
and he say unto they , what counsel give ye that we may answer this people , who have speak to i , say , make the yoke which thy father do put upon we lighter ?
and the young man that be grow up with he speak unto he , say , thus shalt thou speak unto this people that speak unto thee , say , thy father make we yoke heavy , but make thou it lighter unto we ; thus shalt thou say unto they , my little finger shall be thicker than my father 's loin .
and now whereas my father do lade you with a heavy yoke , i will add to you yoke : my father have chastise you with whip , but i will chastise you with scorpion .
so jeroboam and all the people come to rehoboam the third day , as the king have appoint , say , come to i again the third day .
and the king answer the people roughly , and forsake the old man 's counsel that they give he ;
and spake to they after the counsel of the young man , say , my father make you yoke heavy , and i will add to you yoke : my father also chastise you with whip , but i will chastise you with scorpion .
wherefore the king hearken not unto the people ; for the cause be from the lord , that he might perform he say , which the lord spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat .
so when all israel see that the king hearken not unto they , the people answer the king , say , what portion have we in david ? neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse : to you tent , o israel : now see to thine own house , david .
so israel depart unto they tent .
but as for the child of israel which dwell in the city of judah , rehoboam reign over they .
then king rehoboam send adoram , who be over the tribute ; and all israel stone he with stone , that he die .
therefore king rehoboam make speed to get he up to he chariot , to flee to jerusalem .
so israel rebel against the house of david unto this day .
and it come to pass , when all israel hear that jeroboam be come again , that they send and call he unto the congregation , and make he king over all israel : there be none that follow the house of david , but the tribe of judah only .
and when rehoboam be come to jerusalem , he assemble all the house of judah , with the tribe of benjamin , a hundred and fourscore thousand choose man , which be warrior , to fight against the house of israel , to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon .
but the word of god come unto shemaiah the man of god , say ,
speak unto rehoboam , the son of solomon , king of judah , and unto all the house of judah and benjamin , and to the remnant of the people , say ,
thus saith the lord , ye shall not go up , nor fight against you brethren the child of israel : return every man to he house ; for this thing be from i .
they hearken therefore to the word of the lord , and return to depart , accord to the word of the lord .
then jeroboam build shechem in mount ephraim , and dwelt therein ; and go out from thence , and build penuel .
and jeroboam say in he heart , now shall the kingdom return to the house of david :
