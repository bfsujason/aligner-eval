and the earth be without form , and void ; and darkness be upon the face of the deep .
and the spirit of god move upon the face of the water .
and god say , let there be light : and there be light .
and god see the light , that it be good : and god divide the light from the darkness .
and god call the light day , and the darkness he call night .
and the evening and the morning be the first day .
and god say , let there be a firmament in the midst of the water , and let it divide the water from the water .
and god make the firmament , and divide the water which be under the firmament from the water which be above the firmament : and it be so .
and god call the firmament heaven .
and the evening and the morning be the second day .
and god say , let the water under the heaven be gather together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it be so .
and god call the dry land earth ; and the gathering together of the water call he sea : and god see that it be good .
and god say , let the earth bring forth grass , the herb yield seed , and the fruit tree yield fruit after he kind , whose seed be in itself , upon the earth : and it be so .
and the earth bring forth grass , and herb yielding seed after he kind , and the tree yield fruit , whose seed be in itself , after he kind : and god see that it be good .
and the evening and the morning be the third day .
and god say , let there be light in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let they be for sign , and for season , and for day , and year :
and let they be for light in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth : and it be so .
and god make two great light ; the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night : he make the star also .
and god set they in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth ,
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness : and god see that it be good .
and the evening and the morning be the fourth day .
and god say , let the water bring forth abundantly the move creature that have life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
and god create great whale , and every living creature that moveth , which the water bring forth abundantly , after they kind , and every winged fowl after he kind : and god see that it be good .
and god bless they , say , be fruitful , and multiply , and fill the water in the sea , and let fowl multiply in the earth .

and on the seventh day god end he work which he have make ; and he rest on the seventh day from all he work which he have make .
and god bless the seventh day , and sanctify it : because that in it he have rest from all he work which god create and make .
these be the generation of the heaven and of the earth when they be create , in the day that the lord god make the earth and the heaven ,
and every plant of the field before it be in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grow : for the lord god have not cause it to rain upon the earth , and there be not a man to till the ground .
but there go up a mist from the earth , and water the whole face of the ground .
and the lord god form man of the dust of the ground , and breathe into he nostril the breath of life ; and man become a living soul .
and the lord god plant a garden eastward in eden ; and there he put the man whom he have form .
and out of the ground make the lord god to grow every tree that be pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
and a river go out of eden to water the garden ; and from thence it be part , and become into four head .
the name of the first be pison : that be it which compasseth the whole land of havilah , where there be gold ;
and the gold of that land be good : there be bdellium and the onyx stone .
and the name of the second river be gihon : the same be it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia .
and the name of the third river be hiddekel : that be it which goeth toward the east of assyria .
and the fourth river be euphrates .
and the lord god take the man , and put he into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it .
and the lord god command the man , say , of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat :
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die .
and the lord god say , it be not good that the man should be alone ; i will make he a help meet for he .
and out of the ground the lord god form every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air ; and bring they unto adam to see what he would call they : and whatsoever adam call every living creature , that be the name thereof .
and adam give name to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for adam there be not find a help meet for he .
and the lord god cause a deep sleep to fall upon adam , and he sleep : and he take one of he rib , and close up the flesh instead thereof ;
and the rib , which the lord god have take from man , make he a woman , and bring she unto the man .
and adam say , this be now bone of my bone , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be call woman , because she be take out of man .
therefore shall a man leave he father and he mother , and shall cleave unto he wife : and they shall be one flesh .
and they be both naked , the man and he wife , and be not ashamed .
now the serpent be more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god have make .
and he say unto the woman , yea , have god say , ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
and the woman say unto the serpent , we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden :
but of the fruit of the tree which be in the midst of the garden , god have say , ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and the serpent say unto the woman , ye shall not surely die :
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then you eye shall be open , and ye shall be as god , know good and evil .
and when the woman see that the tree be good for food , and that it be pleasant to the eye , and a tree to be desire to make one wise , she take of the fruit thereof , and do eat , and give also unto she husband with she ; and he do eat .
and the eye of they both be open , and they know that they be naked ; and they sew fig leaf together , and make themselves apron .
and they hear the voice of the lord god walk in the garden in the cool of the day : and adam and he wife hide themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the tree of the garden .
and the lord god call unto adam , and say unto he , where art thou ?
and he say , i hear thy voice in the garden , and i be afraid , because i be naked ; and i hide myself .
and he say , who tell thee that thou wast naked ?
hast thou eat of the tree , whereof i command thee that thou shouldest not eat ?
and the man say , the woman whom thou gavest to be with i , she give i of the tree , and i do eat .
and the lord god say unto the woman , what be this that thou hast do ?
and the woman say , the serpent beguile i , and i do eat .
and the lord god say unto the serpent , because thou hast do this , thou art curse above all cattle , and above every beast of the field ; upon thy belly shalt thou go , and dust shalt thou eat all the day of thy life :
and i will put enmity between thee and the woman , and between thy seed and she seed ; it shall bruise thy head , and thou shalt bruise he heel .
unto the woman he say , i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth child ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
and unto adam he say , because thou hast hearken unto the voice of thy wife , and hast eat of the tree , of which i command thee , say , thou shalt not eat of it : curse be the ground for thy sake ; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the day of thy life ;
thorns also and thistle shall it bring forth to thee ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ;
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it be thou take : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
and adam call he wife 's name eve ; because she be the mother of all living .
unto adam also and to he wife do the lord god make coat of skin , and clothe they .
and the lord god say , behold , the man be become as one of we , to know good and evil : and now , lest he put forth he hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever :
therefore the lord god send he forth from the garden of eden , to till the ground from whence he be take .
so he drive out the man ; and he place at the east of the garden of eden cherubims , and a flaming sword which turn every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
and adam know eve he wife ; and she conceive , and bare cain , and say , i have get a man from the lord .
and she again bare he brother abel .
and abel be a keeper of sheep , but cain be a tiller of the ground .
and in process of time it come to pass , that cain bring of the fruit of the ground a offering unto the lord .
and abel , he also bring of the firstling of he flock and of the fat thereof .
and the lord have respect unto abel and to he offering :
but unto cain and to he offering he have not respect .
and cain be very wroth , and he countenance fell .
and the lord say unto cain , why art thou wroth ? and why be thy countenance fall ?
if thou doest well , shalt thou not be accept ? and if thou doest not well , sin lieth at the door .
and unto thee shall be he desire , and thou shalt rule over he .
and cain talk with abel he brother : and it come to pass , when they be in the field , that cain rise up against abel he brother , and slew he .
and the lord say unto cain , where be abel thy brother ?
and he say , i know not : be i my brother 's keeper ?
and he say , what hast thou do ? the voice of thy brother 's blood crieth unto i from the ground .
and now art thou curse from the earth , which have open she mouth to receive thy brother 's blood from thy hand ;
when thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee she strength ; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth .
and cain say unto the lord , my punishment be greater than i can bear .
behold , thou hast drive i out this day from the face of the earth ; and from thy face shall i be hide ; and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth ; and it shall come to pass , that every one that findeth i shall slay i .
and the lord say unto he , therefore whosoever slayeth cain , vengeance shall be take on he sevenfold .
and the lord set a mark upon cain , lest any find he should kill he .
and cain go out from the presence of the lord , and dwelt in the land of nod , on the east of eden .
and cain know he wife ; and she conceive , and bare enoch : and he build a city , and call the name of the city , after the name of he son , enoch .
and unto enoch be bear irad : and irad beget mehujael : and mehujael beget methusael : and methusael beget lamech .
and lamech take unto he two wife : the name of the one be adah , and the name of the other zillah .
and adah bare jabal : he be the father of such as dwell in tent , and of such as have cattle .
and he brother 's name be jubal : he be the father of all such as handle the harp and organ .
and zillah , she also bare tubalcain , a instructer of every artificer in brass and iron : and the sister of tubalcain be naamah .
and lamech say unto he wife , adah and zillah , hear my voice ; ye wife of lamech , hearken unto my speech : for i have slay a man to my wounding , and a young man to my hurt .
if cain shall be avenge sevenfold , truly lamech seventy and sevenfold .
and adam know he wife again ; and she bare a son , and call he name seth : for god , say she , have appoint i another seed instead of abel , whom cain slew .
and to seth , to he also there be bear a son ; and he call he name enos : then begin man to call upon the name of the lord .
this be the book of the generation of adam .
in the day that god create man , in the likeness of god make he he ;
male and female create he they ; and bless they , and call they name adam , in the day when they be create .
and adam live a hundred and thirty year , and beget a son in he own likeness , after he image ; and call he name seth :

and it come to pass , when man begin to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughter be bear unto they ,
that the son of god see the daughter of man that they be fair ; and they take they wife of all which they choose .
and the lord say , my spirit shall not always strive with man , for that he also be flesh : yet he day shall be a hundred and twenty year .
there be giant in the earth in those day ; and also after that , when the son of god come in unto the daughter of man , and they bare child to they , the same become mighty man which be of old , man of renown .
and god see that the wickedness of man be great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thought of he heart be only evil continually .
and it repent the lord that he have make man on the earth , and it grieve he at he heart .
and the lord say , i will destroy man whom i have create from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the creep thing , and the fowl of the air ; for it repenteth i that i have make they .
but noah find grace in the eye of the lord .
these be the generation of noah : noah be a just man and perfect in he generation , and noah walk with god .
and noah beget three son , shem , ham , and japheth .
the earth also be corrupt before god , and the earth be fill with violence .
and god look upon the earth , and , behold , it be corrupt ; for all flesh have corrupt he way upon the earth .
and god say unto noah , the end of all flesh be come before i ; for the earth be fill with violence through they ; and , behold , i will destroy they with the earth .
make thee a ark of gopher wood ; room shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
and this be the fashion which thou shalt make it of : the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubit , the breadth of it fifty cubit , and the height of it thirty cubit .
a window shalt thou make to the ark , and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above ; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof ; with lower , second , and third story shalt thou make it .
and , behold , i , even i , do bring a flood of water upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein be the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that be in the earth shall die .
but with thee will i establish my covenant ; and thou shalt come into the ark , thou , and thy son , and thy wife , and thy son ' wife with thee .
and of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark , to keep they alive with thee ; they shall be male and female .
of fowl after they kind , and of cattle after they kind , of every creep thing of the earth after he kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep they alive .
and take thou unto thee of all food that be eat , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for they .
thus do noah ; accord to all that god command he , so do he .
and the lord say unto noah , come thou and all thy house into the ark ; for thee have i see righteous before i in this generation .
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by seven , the male and he female : and of beast that be not clean by two , the male and he female .

and noah do accord unto all that the lord command he .
and noah be six hundred year old when the flood of water be upon the earth .
and noah go in , and he son , and he wife , and he son ' wife with he , into the ark , because of the water of the flood .
of clean beast , and of beast that be not clean , and of fowl , and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth ,
there go in two and two unto noah into the ark , the male and the female , as god have command noah .
and it come to pass after seven day , that the water of the flood be upon the earth .

and they go in unto noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein be the breath of life .
and they that go in , go in male and female of all flesh , as god have command he : and the lord shut he in .
and the flood be forty day upon the earth ; and the water increase , and bare up the ark , and it be lift up above the earth .
and the water prevail , and be increase greatly upon the earth ; and the ark go upon the face of the water .
and the water prevail exceedingly upon the earth ; and all the high hill , that be under the whole heaven , be cover .
fifteen cubit upward do the water prevail ; and the mountain be cover .
and all flesh die that move upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every creep thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man :
all in whose nostril be the breath of life , of all that be in the dry land , die .
and every living substance be destroy which be upon the face of the ground , both man , and cattle , and the creep thing , and the fowl of the heaven ; and they be destroy from the earth : and noah only remain alive , and they that be with he in the ark .
and the water prevail upon the earth a hundred and fifty day .
and god remember noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that be with he in the ark : and god make a wind to pass over the earth , and the water asswage ;

and it come to pass at the end of forty day , that noah open the window of the ark which he have make :
and he send forth a raven , which go forth to and fro , until the water be dry up from off the earth .
also he send forth a dive from he , to see if the water be abate from off the face of the ground ;
but the dive find no rest for the sole of she foot , and she return unto he into the ark , for the water be on the face of the whole earth : then he put forth he hand , and take she , and pull she in unto he into the ark .
and he stay yet other seven day ; and again he send forth the dive out of the ark ;
and the dive come in to he in the evening ; and , lo , in she mouth be a olive leaf pluckt off : so noah know that the water be abate from off the earth .
and he stay yet other seven day ; and send forth the dive ; which return not again unto he any more .
and it come to pass in the six hundredth and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the water be dry up from off the earth : and noah remove the covering of the ark , and look , and , behold , the face of the ground be dry .
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , be the earth dry .
and god speak unto noah , say ,
go forth of the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy son , and thy son ' wife with thee .
bring forth with thee every living thing that be with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creep thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
and noah go forth , and he son , and he wife , and he son ' wife with he :
every beast , every creep thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after they kind , go forth out of the ark .
and noah build a altar unto the lord ; and take of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offer burnt offering on the altar .
and the lord smell a sweet savour ; and the lord say in he heart , i will not again curse the ground any more for man 's sake ; for the imagination of man 's heart be evil from he youth ; neither will i again smite any more every thing living , as i have do .
while the earth remaineth , seedtime and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease .
and god bless noah and he son , and say unto they , be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth .
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth , and upon every fowl of the air , upon all that moveth upon the earth , and upon all the fish of the sea ; into you hand be they deliver .
every move thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have i give you all thing .
but flesh with the life thereof , which be the blood thereof , shall ye not eat .
and surely you blood of you life will i require ; at the hand of every beast will i require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will i require the life of man .
whoso sheddeth man 's blood , by man shall he blood be shed : for in the image of god make he man .
and you , be ye fruitful , and multiply ; bring forth abundantly in the earth , and multiply therein .
and god speak unto noah , and to he son with he , say ,
and i , behold , i establish my covenant with you , and with you seed after you ;
and with every living creature that be with you , of the fowl , of the cattle , and of every beast of the earth with you ; from all that go out of the ark , to every beast of the earth .
and i will establish my covenant with you ; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the water of a flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth .
and god say , this be the token of the covenant which i make between i and you and every living creature that be with you , for perpetual generation :
i do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between i and the earth .
and it shall come to pass , when i bring a cloud over the earth , that the bow shall be see in the cloud :
and i will remember my covenant , which be between i and you and every living creature of all flesh ; and the water shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
and the bow shall be in the cloud ; and i will look upon it , that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that be upon the earth .
and god say unto noah , this be the token of the covenant , which i have establish between i and all flesh that be upon the earth .

and it come to pass , as they journey from the east , that they find a plain in the land of shinar ; and they dwell there .
and they say one to another , go to , let we make brick , and burn they thoroughly .
and they have brick for stone , and slime have they for morter .
and they say , go to , let we build we a city and a tower , whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let we make we a name , lest we be scatter abroad upon the face of the whole earth .
and the lord come down to see the city and the tower , which the child of man build .
and the lord say , behold , the people be one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrain from they , which they have imagine to do .
go to , let we go down , and there confound they language , that they may not understand one another 's speech .
so the lord scatter they abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth : and they leave off to build the city .
therefore be the name of it call babel ; because the lord do there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence do the lord scatter they abroad upon the face of all the earth .
these be the generation of shem : shem be a hundred year old , and begat arphaxad two year after the flood :
and shem live after he beget arphaxad five hundred year , and begat son and daughter .
and arphaxad live five and thirty year , and beget salah :
and arphaxad live after he beget salah four hundred and three year , and begat son and daughter .
and salah live thirty year , and beget eber :
and salah live after he beget eber four hundred and three year , and begat son and daughter .
and eber live four and thirty year , and beget peleg :
and eber live after he beget peleg four hundred and thirty year , and begat son and daughter .
and peleg live thirty year , and begat reu :
and peleg live after he beget reu two hundred and nine year , and begat son and daughter .
and reu live two and thirty year , and beget serug :
and reu live after he beget serug two hundred and seven year , and begat son and daughter .
and serug live thirty year , and beget nahor :
and serug live after he beget nahor two hundred year , and begat son and daughter .
and nahor live nine and twenty year , and beget terah :
and nahor live after he beget terah a hundred and nineteen year , and begat son and daughter .
and terah live seventy year , and beget abram , nahor , and haran .
now these be the generation of terah : terah beget abram , nahor , and haran ; and haran beget lot .
and haran die before he father terah in the land of he nativity , in ur of the chaldees .
and abram and nahor take they wife : the name of abram 's wife be sarai ; and the name of nahor 's wife , milcah , the daughter of haran , the father of milcah , and the father of iscah .
but sarai be barren ; she have no child .
and terah take abram he son , and lot the son of haran he son 's son , and sarai he daughter in law , he son abram 's wife ; and they go forth with they from ur of the chaldees , to go into the land of canaan ; and they come unto haran , and dwelt there .
and the day of terah be two hundred and five year : and terah die in haran .
now the lord have say unto abram , get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and from thy father 's house , unto a land that i will shew thee :
and i will make of thee a great nation , and i will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and thou shalt be a blessing :
and i will bless they that bless thee , and curse he that curseth thee : and in thee shall all family of the earth be bless .
so abram depart , as the lord have speak unto he ; and lot go with he : and abram be seventy and five year old when he depart out of haran .
and abram take sarai he wife , and lot he brother 's son , and all they substance that they have gather , and the soul that they have get in haran ; and they go forth to go into the land of canaan ; and into the land of canaan they come .
and abram pass through the land unto the place of sichem , unto the plain of moreh .
and the canaanite be then in the land .
and the lord appear unto abram , and say , unto thy seed will i give this land : and there build he a altar unto the lord , who appear unto he .
and he remove from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel , and pitch he tent , have bethel on the west , and hai on the east : and there he build a altar unto the lord , and call upon the name of the lord .
and abram journey , go on still toward the south .
and there be a famine in the land : and abram go down into egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine be grievous in the land .
and it come to pass , when he be come near to enter into egypt , that he say unto sarai he wife , behold now , i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
therefore it shall come to pass , when the egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , this be he wife : and they will kill i , but they will save thee alive .
say , i pray thee , thou art my sister : that it may be well with i for thy sake ; and my soul shall live because of thee .
and it come to pass , that , when abram be come into egypt , the egyptians behold the woman that she be very fair .
the prince also of pharaoh see she , and commend she before pharaoh : and the woman be take into pharaoh 's house .
and he entreat abram well for she sake : and he have sheep , and ox , and he ass , and manservant , and maidservant , and she ass , and camel .
and the lord plague pharaoh and he house with great plague because of sarai abram 's wife .
and pharaoh call abram , and say , what be this that thou hast do unto i ? why didst thou not tell i that she be thy wife ?
why saidst thou , she be my sister ? so i might have take she to i to wife : now therefore behold thy wife , take she , and go thy way .
and pharaoh command he man concern he : and they send he away , and he wife , and all that he have .
and abram go up out of egypt , he , and he wife , and all that he have , and lot with he , into the south .
and abram be very rich in cattle , in silver , and in gold .
and he go on he journey from the south even to bethel , unto the place where he tent have be at the beginning , between bethel and hai ;
unto the place of the altar , which he have make there at the first : and there abram call on the name of the lord .
and lot also , which go with abram , have flock , and herd , and tent .
and the land be not able to bear they , that they might dwell together : for they substance be great , so that they could not dwell together .
and there be a strife between the herdman of abram 's cattle and the herdman of lot 's cattle : and the canaanite and the perizzite dwell then in the land .
and abram say unto lot , let there be no strife , i pray thee , between i and thee , and between my herdman and thy herdman ; for we be brethren .
be not the whole land before thee ? separate thyself , i pray thee , from i : if thou wilt take the left hand , then i will go to the right ; or if thou depart to the right hand , then i will go to the left .
and lot lift up he eye , and behold all the plain of jordan , that it be well water every where , before the lord destroy sodom and gomorrah , even as the garden of the lord , like the land of egypt , as thou comest unto zoar .
then lot choose he all the plain of jordan ; and lot journey east : and they separate themselves the one from the other .
abram dwell in the land of canaan , and lot dwell in the city of the plain , and pitch he tent toward sodom .
but the man of sodom be wicked and sinner before the lord exceedingly .
and the lord say unto abram , after that lot be separate from he , lift up now thine eye , and look from the place where thou art northward , and southward , and eastward , and westward :
for all the land which thou seest , to thee will i give it , and to thy seed for ever .
and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be number .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for i will give it unto thee .
then abram remove he tent , and come and dwelt in the plain of mamre , which be in hebron , and build there a altar unto the lord .
and it come to pass in the day of amraphel king of shinar , arioch king of ellasar , chedorlaomer king of elam , and tidal king of nation ;
that these make war with bera king of sodom , and with birsha king of gomorrah , shinab king of admah , and shemeber king of zeboiim , and the king of bela , which be zoar .
all these be join together in the vale of siddim , which be the salt sea .
twelve year they serve chedorlaomer , and in the thirteenth year they rebel .
and in the fourteenth year come chedorlaomer , and the king that be with he , and smite the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim , and the zuzims in ham , and the emim in shaveh kiriathaim ,
and the horites in they mount seir , unto elparan , which be by the wilderness .
and they return , and come to enmishpat , which be kadesh , and smite all the country of the amalekites , and also the amorites , that dwelt in hazezontamar .
and there go out the king of sodom , and the king of gomorrah , and the king of admah , and the king of zeboiim , and the king of bela ( the same be zoar ; ) and they join battle with they in the vale of siddim ;
with chedorlaomer the king of elam , and with tidal king of nation , and amraphel king of shinar , and arioch king of ellasar ; four king with five .
and the vale of siddim be full of slimepit ; and the king of sodom and gomorrah flee , and fall there ; and they that remain flee to the mountain .
and they take all the goods of sodom and gomorrah , and all they victuals , and go they way .
and they take lot , abram 's brother 's son , who dwell in sodom , and he goods , and depart .
and there come one that have escape , and tell abram the hebrew ; for he dwell in the plain of mamre the amorite , brother of eshcol , and brother of aner : and these be confederate with abram .
and when abram hear that he brother be take captive , he arm he trained servant , bear in he own house , three hundred and eighteen , and pursue they unto dan .
and he divide himself against they , he and he servant , by night , and smite they , and pursue they unto hobah , which be on the left hand of damascus .
and he bring back all the goods , and also bring again he brother lot , and he goods , and the woman also , and the people .
and the king of sodom go out to meet he after he return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer , and of the king that be with he , at the valley of shaveh , which be the king 's dale .
and melchizedek king of salem bring forth bread and wine : and he be the priest of the most high god .
and he bless he , and say , blessed be abram of the most high god , possessor of heaven and earth :
and bless be the most high god , which have deliver thine enemy into thy hand .
and he give he tithe of all .
and the king of sodom say unto abram , give i the person , and take the goods to thyself .
and abram say to the king of sodom , i have lift up mine hand unto the lord , the most high god , the possessor of heaven and earth ,
that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet , and that i will not take any thing that be thine , lest thou shouldest say , i have make abram rich :
save only that which the young man have eat , and the portion of the man which go with i , aner , eshcol , and mamre ; let they take they portion .
after these thing the word of the lord come unto abram in a vision , say , fear not , abram : i be thy shield , and thy exceed great reward .
and abram say , lord god , what wilt thou give i , see i go childless , and the steward of my house be this eliezer of damascus ?
and abram say , behold , to i thou hast give no seed : and , lo , one bear in my house be mine heir .
and , behold , the word of the lord come unto he , say , this shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
and he bring he forth abroad , and say , look now toward heaven , and tell the star , if thou be able to number they : and he say unto he , so shall thy seed be .
and he believe in the lord ; and he count it to he for righteousness .
and he say unto he , i be the lord that bring thee out of ur of the chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it .
and he say , lord god , whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it ?
and he say unto he , take i a heifer of three year old , and a she goat of three year old , and a ram of three year old , and a turtledove , and a young pigeon .
and he take unto he all these , and divide they in the midst , and lay each piece one against another : but the bird divide he not .
and when the fowl come down upon the carcase , abram drive they away .
and when the sun be go down , a deep sleep fall upon abram ; and , lo , a horror of great darkness fall upon he .
and he say unto abram , know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that be not theirs , and shall serve they ; and they shall afflict they four hundred year ;
and also that nation , whom they shall serve , will i judge : and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
and thou shalt go to thy father in peace ; thou shalt be bury in a good old age .
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again : for the iniquity of the amorites be not yet full .
and it come to pass , that , when the sun go down , and it be dark , behold a smoking furnace , and a burning lamp that pass between those piece .
in the same day the lord make a covenant with abram , say , unto thy seed have i give this land , from the river of egypt unto the great river , the river euphrates :
the kenites , and the kenizzites , and the kadmonites ,
and the hittites , and the perizzites , and the rephaims ,
and the amorites , and the canaanites , and the girgashites , and the jebusites .
now sarai abram 's wife bare he no child : and she have a handmaid , a egyptian , whose name be hagar .
and sarai say unto abram , behold now , the lord have restrain i from bearing : i pray thee , go in unto my maid ; it may be that i may obtain child by she .
and abram hearken to the voice of sarai .
and sarai abram 's wife take hagar she maid the egyptian , after abram have dwell ten year in the land of canaan , and give she to she husband abram to be he wife .
and he go in unto hagar , and she conceive : and when she see that she have conceive , she mistress be despise in she eye .
and sarai say unto abram , my wrong be upon thee : i have give my maid into thy bosom ; and when she see that she have conceive , i be despise in she eye : the lord judge between i and thee .
but abram say unto sarai , behold , thy maid be in thy hand ; do to she as it pleaseth thee .
and when sarai deal hardly with she , she flee from she face .
and the angel of the lord find she by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to shur .
and he say , hagar , sarai 's maid , whence camest thou ? and whither wilt thou go ?
and she say , i flee from the face of my mistress sarai .
and the angel of the lord say unto she , return to thy mistress , and submit thyself under she hand .
and the angel of the lord say unto she , i will multiply thy seed exceedingly , that it shall not be number for multitude .
and the angel of the lord say unto she , behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call he name ishmael ; because the lord have hear thy affliction .
and he will be a wild man ; he hand will be against every man , and every man 's hand against he ; and he shall dwell in the presence of all he brethren .
and she call the name of the lord that speak unto she , thou god seest i : for she say , have i also here look after he that seeth i ?
wherefore the well be call beerlahairoi ; behold , it be between kadesh and bered .
and hagar bare abram a son : and abram call he son 's name , which hagar bare , ishmael .
and abram be fourscore and six year old , when hagar bare ishmael to abram .
and when abram be ninety year old and nine , the lord appear to abram , and say unto he , i be the almighty god ; walk before i , and be thou perfect .
and i will make my covenant between i and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly .
and abram fall on he face : and god talk with he , say ,
as for i , behold , my covenant be with thee , and thou shalt be a father of many nation .
neither shall thy name any more be call abram , but thy name shall be abraham ; for a father of many nation have i make thee .
and i will make thee exceed fruitful , and i will make nation of thee , and king shall come out of thee .
and i will establish my covenant between i and thee and thy seed after thee in they generation for a everlasting covenant , to be a god unto thee , and to thy seed after thee .
and i will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of canaan , for a everlasting possession ; and i will be they god .
and god say unto abraham , thou shalt keep my covenant therefore , thou , and thy seed after thee in they generation .
this be my covenant , which ye shall keep , between i and you and thy seed after thee ; every man child among you shall be circumcise .
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of you foreskin ; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt i and you .
and he that be eight day old shall be circumcise among you , every man child in you generation , he that be bear in the house , or buy with money of any stranger , which be not of thy seed .
he that be bear in thy house , and he that be buy with thy money , must need be circumcise : and my covenant shall be in you flesh for a everlasting covenant .
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of he foreskin be not circumcise , that soul shall be cut off from he people ; he have broken my covenant .
and god say unto abraham , as for sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call she name sarai , but sarah shall she name be .
and i will bless she , and give thee a son also of she : yea , i will bless she , and she shall be a mother of nation ; king of people shall be of she .
then abraham fall upon he face , and laugh , and say in he heart , shall a child be bear unto he that be a hundred year old ? and shall sarah , that be ninety year old , bear ?
and abraham say unto god , o that ishmael might live before thee !
and god say , sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed ; and thou shalt call he name isaac : and i will establish my covenant with he for a everlasting covenant , and with he seed after he .
and as for ishmael , i have hear thee : behold , i have bless he , and will make he fruitful , and will multiply he exceedingly ; twelve prince shall he beget , and i will make he a great nation .
but my covenant will i establish with isaac , which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year .
and he leave off talk with he , and god go up from abraham .
and abraham take ishmael he son , and all that be bear in he house , and all that be buy with he money , every male among the man of abraham 's house ; and circumcise the flesh of they foreskin in the selfsame day , as god have say unto he .
and abraham be ninety year old and nine , when he be circumcise in the flesh of he foreskin .
and ishmael he son be thirteen year old , when he be circumcise in the flesh of he foreskin .
in the selfsame day be abraham circumcise , and ishmael he son .
and all the man of he house , bear in the house , and buy with money of the stranger , be circumcise with he .
and the lord appear unto he in the plain of mamre : and he sit in the tent door in the heat of the day ;
and he lift up he eye and look , and , lo , three man stand by he : and when he see they , he run to meet they from the tent door , and bow himself toward the ground ,
and say , my lord , if now i have find favour in thy sight , pass not away , i pray thee , from thy servant :
let a little water , i pray you , be fetch , and wash you foot , and rest yourselve under the tree :
and i will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye you heart ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore be ye come to you servant .
and they say , so do , as thou hast say .
and abraham hasten into the tent unto sarah , and say , make ready quickly three measure of fine meal , knead it , and make cake upon the hearth .
and abraham run unto the herd , and fetcht a calf tender and good , and give it unto a young man ; and he hast to dress it .
and he take butter , and milk , and the calf which he have dress , and set it before they ; and he stand by they under the tree , and they do eat .
and they say unto he , where be sarah thy wife ?
and he say , behold , in the tent .
and he say , i will certainly return unto thee accord to the time of life ; and , lo , sarah thy wife shall have a son .
and sarah hear it in the tent door , which be behind he .
now abraham and sarah be old and well stricken in age ; and it cease to be with sarah after the manner of woman .
therefore sarah laugh within herself , say , after i be wax old shall i have pleasure , my lord be old also ?
and the lord say unto abraham , wherefore do sarah laugh , say , shall i of a surety bear a child , which be old ?
be any thing too hard for the lord ?
at the time appoint i will return unto thee , accord to the time of life , and sarah shall have a son .
then sarah deny , say , i laugh not ; for she be afraid .
and he say , nay ; but thou didst laugh .
and the man rise up from thence , and look toward sodom : and abraham go with they to bring they on the way .
and the lord say , shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do ;
see that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nation of the earth shall be bless in he ?
for i know he , that he will command he child and he household after he , and they shall keep the way of the lord , to do justice and judgment ; that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he have speak of he .
and the lord say , because the cry of sodom and gomorrah be great , and because they sin be very grievous ;
i will go down now , and see whether they have do altogether accord to the cry of it , which be come unto i ; and if not , i will know .
and the man turn they face from thence , and go toward sodom : but abraham stand yet before the lord .
and abraham draw near , and say , wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked ?
peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city : wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that be therein ?
that be far from thee to do after this manner , to slay the righteous with the wicked : and that the righteous should be as the wicked , that be far from thee : shall not the judge of all the earth do right ?
and the lord say , if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city , then i will spare all the place for they sake .
and abraham answer and say , behold now , i have take upon i to speak unto the lord , which be but dust and ash :
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous : wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five ?
and he say , if i find there forty and five , i will not destroy it .
and he speak unto he yet again , and say , peradventure there shall be forty find there .
and he say , i will not do it for forty 's sake .
and he say unto he , oh let not the lord be angry , and i will speak : peradventure there shall thirty be find there .
and he say , i will not do it , if i find thirty there .
and he say , behold now , i have take upon i to speak unto the lord : peradventure there shall be twenty find there .
and he say , i will not destroy it for twenty 's sake .
and he say , oh let not the lord be angry , and i will speak yet but this once : peradventure ten shall be find there .
and he say , i will not destroy it for ten 's sake .
and the lord go he way , as soon as he have leave commune with abraham : and abraham return unto he place .
and there come two angel to sodom at even ; and lot sit in the gate of sodom : and lot see they rise up to meet they ; and he bow himself with he face toward the ground ;
and he say , behold now , my lord , turn in , i pray you , into you servant 's house , and tarry all night , and wash you foot , and ye shall rise up early , and go on you way .
and they say , nay ; but we will abide in the street all night .
and he press upon they greatly ; and they turn in unto he , and enter into he house ; and he make they a feast , and do bake unleavened bread , and they do eat .
but before they lay down , the man of the city , even the man of sodom , compass the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and they call unto lot , and say unto he , where be the man which come in to thee this night ? bring they out unto we , that we may know they .
and lot go out at the door unto they , and shut the door after he ,
and say , i pray you , brethren , do not so wickedly .
behold now , i have two daughter which have not know man ; let i , i pray you , bring they out unto you , and do ye to they as be good in you eye : only unto these man do nothing ; for therefore come they under the shadow of my roof .
and they say , stand back .
and they say again , this one fellow come in to sojourn , and he will need be a judge : now will we deal worse with thee , than with they .
and they press sore upon the man , even lot , and come near to break the door .
but the man put forth they hand , and pull lot into the house to they , and shut to the door .
and they smite the man that be at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they weary themselves to find the door .
and the man say unto lot , hast thou here any besides ? son in law , and thy son , and thy daughter , and whatsoever thou hast in the city , bring they out of this place :
for we will destroy this place , because the cry of they be waxen great before the face of the lord ; and the lord have send we to destroy it .
and lot go out , and spake unto he son in law , which marry he daughter , and say , up , get you out of this place ; for the lord will destroy this city .
but he seem as one that mock unto he son in law .
and when the morning arise , then the angel hasten lot , say , arise , take thy wife , and thy two daughter , which be here ; lest thou be consume in the iniquity of the city .
and while he linger , the man lay hold upon he hand , and upon the hand of he wife , and upon the hand of he two daughter ; the lord be merciful unto he : and they bring he forth , and set he without the city .
and it come to pass , when they have bring they forth abroad , that he say , escape for thy life ; look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain , lest thou be consume .
and lot say unto they , oh , not so , my lord :
behold now , thy servant have find grace in thy sight , and thou hast magnify thy mercy , which thou hast shew unto i in save my life ; and i can not escape to the mountain , lest some evil take i , and i die :
behold now , this city be near to flee unto , and it be a little one : oh , let i escape thither , ( be it not a little one ? ) and my soul shall live .
and he say unto he , see , i have accept thee concern this thing also , that i will not overthrow this city , for the which thou hast speak .
haste thee , escape thither ; for i can not do anything till thou be come thither .
therefore the name of the city be call zoar .
the sun be rise upon the earth when lot enter into zoar .
then the lord rain upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven ;
and he overthrow those city , and all the plain , and all the inhabitant of the city , and that which grow upon the ground .
but he wife look back from behind he , and she become a pillar of salt .
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stand before the lord :
and he look toward sodom and gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country go up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it come to pass , when god destroy the city of the plain , that god remember abraham , and send lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrow the city in the which lot dwelt .
and lot go up out of zoar , and dwelt in the mountain , and he two daughter with he ; for he fear to dwell in zoar : and he dwell in a cave , he and he two daughter .
and the firstborn say unto the younger , we father be old , and there be not a man in the earth to come in unto we after the manner of all the earth :
come , let we make we father drink wine , and we will lie with he , that we may preserve seed of we father .
and they make they father drink wine that night : and the firstborn go in , and lay with she father ; and he perceive not when she lay down , nor when she arise .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that the firstborn say unto the younger , behold , i lay yesternight with my father : let we make he drink wine this night also ; and go thou in , and lie with he , that we may preserve seed of we father .
and they make they father drink wine that night also : and the younger arise , and lay with he ; and he perceive not when she lay down , nor when she arise .
thus be both the daughter of lot with child by they father .
and the first bear bare a son , and call he name moab : the same be the father of the moabites unto this day .
and the younger , she also bare a son , and call he name benammi : the same be the father of the child of ammon unto this day .
and abraham journey from thence toward the south country , and dwell between kadesh and shur , and sojourn in gerar .
and abraham say of sarah he wife , she be my sister : and abimelech king of gerar send , and take sarah .
but god come to abimelech in a dream by night , and say to he , behold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast take ; for she be a man 's wife .
but abimelech have not come near she : and he say , lord , wilt thou slay also a righteous nation ?
said he not unto i , she be my sister ? and she , even she herself say , he be my brother : in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hand have i do this .
and god say unto he in a dream , yea , i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart ; for i also withhold thee from sin against i : therefore suffer i thee not to touch she .
now therefore restore the man he wife ; for he be a prophet , and he shall pray for thee , and thou shalt live : and if thou restore she not , know thou that thou shalt surely die , thou , and all that be thine .
therefore abimelech rise early in the morning , and call all he servant , and tell all these thing in they ear : and the man be sore afraid .
then abimelech call abraham , and say unto he , what hast thou do unto we ? and what have i offend thee , that thou hast bring on i and on my kingdom a great sin ? thou hast do deed unto i that ought not to be do .
and abimelech say unto abraham , what sawest thou , that thou hast do this thing ?
and abraham say , because i think , surely the fear of god be not in this place ; and they will slay i for my wife 's sake .
and yet indeed she be my sister ; she be the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she become my wife .
and it come to pass , when god cause i to wander from my father 's house , that i say unto she , this be thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto i ; at every place whither we shall come , say of i , he be my brother .
and abimelech take sheep , and ox , and manservant , and womenservant , and give they unto abraham , and restore he sarah he wife .
and abimelech say , behold , my land be before thee : dwell where it pleaseth thee .
and unto sarah he say , behold , i have give thy brother a thousand piece of silver : behold , he be to thee a covering of the eye , unto all that be with thee , and with all other : thus she be reprove .
so abraham pray unto god : and god heal abimelech , and he wife , and he maidservant ; and they bare child .
for the lord have fast close up all the womb of the house of abimelech , because of sarah abraham 's wife .
and the lord visit sarah as he have say , and the lord do unto sarah as he have speak .
for sarah conceive , and bare abraham a son in he old age , at the set time of which god have speak to he .
and abraham call the name of he son that be bear unto he , whom sarah bare to he , isaac .
and abraham circumcise he son isaac be eight day old , as god have command he .
and abraham be a hundred year old , when he son isaac be bear unto he .
and sarah say , god have make i to laugh , so that all that hear will laugh with i .
and she say , who would have say unto abraham , that sarah should have give child suck ? for i have bear he a son in he old age .
and the child grow , and be wean : and abraham make a great feast the same day that isaac be wean .
and sarah see the son of hagar the egyptian , which she have bear unto abraham , mock .
wherefore she say unto abraham , cast out this bondwoman and she son : for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with isaac .
and the thing be very grievous in abraham 's sight because of he son .
and god say unto abraham , let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad , and because of thy bondwoman ; in all that sarah have say unto thee , hearken unto she voice ; for in isaac shall thy seed be call .
and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation , because he be thy seed .
and abraham rise up early in the morning , and take bread , and a bottle of water , and give it unto hagar , put it on she shoulder , and the child , and send she away : and she depart , and wander in the wilderness of beersheba .
and the water be spend in the bottle , and she cast the child under one of the shrub .
and she go , and sit she down over against he a good way off , as it be a bow shot : for she say , let i not see the death of the child .
and she sit over against he , and lift up she voice , and weep .
and god hear the voice of the lad ; and the angel of god call to hagar out of heaven , and say unto she , what aileth thee , hagar ? fear not ; for god have hear the voice of the lad where he be .
arise , lift up the lad , and hold he in thine hand ; for i will make he a great nation .
and god open she eye , and she see a well of water ; and she go , and fill the bottle with water , and give the lad drink .
and god be with the lad ; and he grow , and dwelt in the wilderness , and become a archer .
and he dwell in the wilderness of paran : and he mother take he a wife out of the land of egypt .
and it come to pass at that time , that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of he host spake unto abraham , say , god be with thee in all that thou doest :
now therefore swear unto i here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with i , nor with my son , nor with my son 's son : but accord to the kindness that i have do unto thee , thou shalt do unto i , and to the land wherein thou hast sojourn .
and abraham say , i will swear .
and abraham reprove abimelech because of a well of water , which abimelech 's servant have violently take away .
and abimelech say , i wot not who have do this thing : neither do thou tell i , neither yet hear i of it , but to day .
and abraham take sheep and ox , and give they unto abimelech ; and both of they make a covenant .
and abraham set seven ewe lamb of the flock by themselves .
and abimelech say unto abraham , what mean these seven ewe lamb which thou hast set by themselves ?
and he say , for these seven ewe lamb shalt thou take of my hand , that they may be a witness unto i , that i have dig this well .
wherefore he call that place beersheba ; because there they sware both of they .
thus they make a covenant at beersheba : then abimelech rise up , and phichol the chief captain of he host , and they return into the land of the philistines .
and abraham plant a grove in beersheba , and call there on the name of the lord , the everlasting god .
and abraham sojourn in the philistine ' land many day .
and it come to pass after these thing , that god do tempt abraham , and say unto he , abraham : and he say , behold , here i be .
and he say , take now thy son , thine only son isaac , whom thou lovest , and get thee into the land of moriah ; and offer he there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountain which i will tell thee of .
and abraham rise up early in the morning , and saddle he ass , and take two of he young man with he , and isaac he son , and cleave the wood for the burnt offering , and rise up , and go unto the place of which god have tell he .
then on the third day abraham lift up he eye , and see the place afar off .
and abraham say unto he young man , abide ye here with the ass ; and i and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you .
and abraham take the wood of the burnt offering , and lay it upon isaac he son ; and he take the fire in he hand , and a knife ; and they go both of they together .
and isaac spake unto abraham he father , and say , my father : and he say , here be i , my son .
and he say , behold the fire and the wood : but where be the lamb for a burnt offering ?
and abraham say , my son , god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering : so they go both of they together .
and they come to the place which god have tell he of ; and abraham build a altar there , and lay the wood in order , and bind isaac he son , and lay he on the altar upon the wood .
and abraham stretch forth he hand , and take the knife to slay he son .
and the angel of the lord call unto he out of heaven , and say , abraham , abraham : and he say , here be i.
and he say , lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto he : for now i know that thou fearest god , see thou hast not withhold thy son , thine only son from i .
and abraham lift up he eye , and look , and behold behind he a ram catch in a thicket by he horn : and abraham go and take the ram , and offer he up for a burnt offering in the stead of he son .
and abraham call the name of that place jehovahjireh : as it be say to this day , in the mount of the lord it shall be see .
and the angel of the lord call unto abraham out of heaven the second time ,
and say , by myself have i swear , saith the lord , for because thou hast do this thing , and hast not withhold thy son , thine only son :
that in blessing i will bless thee , and in multiply i will multiply thy seed as the star of the heaven , and as the sand which be upon the sea shore ; and thy seed shall possess the gate of he enemy ;
and in thy seed shall all the nation of the earth be bless ; because thou hast obey my voice .
so abraham return unto he young man , and they rise up and go together to beersheba ; and abraham dwelt at beersheba .
and it come to pass after these thing , that it be tell abraham , say , behold , milcah , she have also bear child unto thy brother nahor ;
huz he firstborn , and buz he brother , and kemuel the father of aram ,
and chesed , and hazo , and pildash , and jidlaph , and bethuel .
and bethuel beget rebekah : these eight milcah do bear to nahor , abraham 's brother .
and he concubine , whose name be reumah , she bare also tebah , and gaham , and thahash , and maachah .
and sarah be a hundred and seven and twenty year old : these be the year of the life of sarah .
and sarah die in kirjatharba ; the same be hebron in the land of canaan : and abraham come to mourn for sarah , and to weep for she .
and abraham stand up from before he dead , and spake unto the son of heth , say ,
i be a stranger and a sojourner with you : give i a possession of a buryingplace with you , that i may bury my dead out of my sight .
and the child of heth answer abraham , say unto he ,
hear we , my lord : thou art a mighty prince among we : in the choice of we sepulchre bury thy dead ; none of we shall withhold from thee he sepulchre , but that thou mayest bury thy dead .
and abraham stand up , and bow himself to the people of the land , even to the child of heth .
and he commune with they , say , if it be you mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear i , and intreat for i to ephron the son of zohar ,
that he may give i the cave of machpelah , which he have , which be in the end of he field ; for as much money as it be worth he shall give it i for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you .
and ephron dwelt among the child of heth : and ephron the hittite answer abraham in the audience of the child of heth , even of all that go in at the gate of he city , say ,
nay , my lord , hear i : the field give i thee , and the cave that be therein , i give it thee ; in the presence of the son of my people give i it thee : bury thy dead .
and abraham bow down himself before the people of the land .
and he speak unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land , say , but if thou wilt give it , i pray thee , hear i : i will give thee money for the field ; take it of i , and i will bury my dead there .
and ephron answer abraham , say unto he ,
my lord , hearken unto i : the land be worth four hundred shekel of silver ; what be that betwixt i and thee ? bury therefore thy dead .
and abraham hearken unto ephron ; and abraham weigh to ephron the silver , which he have name in the audience of the son of heth , four hundred shekel of silver , current money with the merchant .
and the field of ephron , which be in machpelah , which be before mamre , the field , and the cave which be therein , and all the tree that be in the field , that be in all the border round about , be make sure
unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the child of heth , before all that go in at the gate of he city .
and after this , abraham bury sarah he wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre : the same be hebron in the land of canaan .
and the field , and the cave that be therein , be make sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the son of heth .
and abraham be old , and well stricken in age : and the lord have bless abraham in all thing .
and abraham say unto he eldest servant of he house , that rule over all that he have , put , i pray thee , thy hand under my thigh :
and i will make thee swear by the lord , the god of heaven , and the god of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughter of the canaanites , among whom i dwell :
but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son isaac .
and the servant say unto he , peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow i unto this land : must i need bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest ?
and abraham say unto he , beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again .
the lord god of heaven , which take i from my father 's house , and from the land of my kindred , and which speak unto i , and that sware unto i , say , unto thy seed will i give this land ; he shall send he angel before thee , and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence .
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again .
and the servant put he hand under the thigh of abraham he master , and sware to he concern that matter .
and the servant take ten camel of the camel of he master , and depart ; for all the goods of he master be in he hand : and he arise , and go to mesopotamia , unto the city of nahor .
and he make he camel to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that woman go out to draw water .
and he say , o lord god of my master abraham , i pray thee , send i good speed this day , and shew kindness unto my master abraham .
behold , i stand here by the well of water ; and the daughter of the man of the city come out to draw water :
and let it come to pass , that the damsel to whom i shall say , let down thy pitcher , i pray thee , that i may drink ; and she shall say , drink , and i will give thy camel drink also : let the same be she that thou hast appoint for thy servant isaac ; and thereby shall i know that thou hast shew kindness unto my master .
and it come to pass , before he have do speaking , that , behold , rebekah come out , who be bear to bethuel , son of milcah , the wife of nahor , abraham 's brother , with she pitcher upon she shoulder .
and the damsel be very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither have any man know she : and she go down to the well , and fill she pitcher , and come up .
and the servant run to meet she , and say , let i , i pray thee , drink a little water of thy pitcher .
and she say , drink , my lord : and she hast , and let down she pitcher upon she hand , and give he drink .
and when she have do give he drink , she say , i will draw water for thy camel also , until they have do drinking .
and she hast , and empty she pitcher into the trough , and run again unto the well to draw water , and draw for all he camel .
and the man wonder at she hold he peace , to wit whether the lord have make he journey prosperous or not .
and it come to pass , as the camel have do drinking , that the man take a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelet for she hand of ten shekel weight of gold ;
and say , whose daughter art thou ? tell i , i pray thee : be there room in thy father 's house for we to lodge in ?
and she say unto he , i be the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah , which she bare unto nahor .
she say moreover unto he , we have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in .
and the man bow down he head , and worship the lord .
and he say , blessed be the lord god of my master abraham , who have not leave destitute my master of he mercy and he truth : i be in the way , the lord lead i to the house of my master 's brethren .
and the damsel run , and tell they of she mother 's house these thing .
and rebekah have a brother , and he name be laban : and laban run out unto the man , unto the well .
and it come to pass , when he see the earring and bracelet upon he sister 's hand , and when he hear the word of rebekah he sister , say , thus speak the man unto i ; that he come unto the man ; and , behold , he stand by the camel at the well .
and he say , come in , thou bless of the lord ; wherefore standest thou without ? for i have prepare the house , and room for the camel .
and the man come into the house : and he ungird he camel , and give straw and provender for the camel , and water to wash he foot , and the man 's foot that be with he .
and there be set meat before he to eat : but he say , i will not eat , until i have tell mine errand .
and he say , speak on .
and he say , i be abraham 's servant .
and the lord have bless my master greatly ; and he be become great : and he have give he flock , and herd , and silver , and gold , and manservant , and maidservant , and camel , and ass .
and sarah my master 's wife bare a son to my master when she be old : and unto he have he give all that he have .
and my master make i swear , say , thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughter of the canaanites , in whose land i dwell :
but thou shalt go unto my father 's house , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son .
and i say unto my master , peradventure the woman will not follow i .
and he say unto i , the lord , before whom i walk , will send he angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father 's house :
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath , when thou comest to my kindred ; and if they give not thee one , thou shalt be clear from my oath .
and i come this day unto the well , and say , o lord god of my master abraham , if now thou do prosper my way which i go :
behold , i stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water , and i say to she , give i , i pray thee , a little water of thy pitcher to drink ;
and she say to i , both drink thou , and i will also draw for thy camel : let the same be the woman whom the lord have appoint out for my master 's son .
and before i have do speaking in mine heart , behold , rebekah come forth with she pitcher on she shoulder ; and she go down unto the well , and draw water : and i say unto she , let i drink , i pray thee .
and she make haste , and let down she pitcher from she shoulder , and say , drink , and i will give thy camel drink also : so i drink , and she make the camel drink also .
and i ask she , and say , whose daughter art thou ?
and she say , the daughter of bethuel , nahor 's son , whom milcah bare unto he : and i put the earring upon she face , and the bracelet upon she hand .
and i bow down my head , and worship the lord , and bless the lord god of my master abraham , which have lead i in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter unto he son .
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell i : and if not , tell i ; that i may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
then laban and bethuel answer and say , the thing proceedeth from the lord : we can not speak unto thee bad or good .
behold , rebekah be before thee , take she , and go , and let she be thy master 's son 's wife , as the lord have speak .
and it come to pass , that , when abraham 's servant hear they word , he worship the lord , bow himself to the earth .
and the servant bring forth jewel of silver , and jewel of gold , and raiment , and give they to rebekah : he give also to she brother and to she mother precious thing .
and they do eat and drink , he and the man that be with he , and tarry all night ; and they rise up in the morning , and he say , send i away unto my master .
and she brother and she mother say , let the damsel abide with we a few day , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
and he say unto they , hinder i not , see the lord have prosper my way ; send i away that i may go to my master .
and they say , we will call the damsel , and enquire at she mouth .
and they call rebekah , and say unto she , wilt thou go with this man ?
and she say , i will go .
and they send away rebekah they sister , and she nurse , and abraham 's servant , and he man .
and they bless rebekah , and say unto she , thou art we sister , be thou the mother of thousand of million , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate they .
and rebekah arise , and she damsel , and they ride upon the camel , and follow the man : and the servant take rebekah , and go he way .
and isaac come from the way of the well lahairous ; for he dwell in the south country .
and isaac go out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lift up he eye , and see , and , behold , the camel be come .
and rebekah lift up she eye , and when she see isaac , she light off the camel .
for she have say unto the servant , what man be this that walketh in the field to meet we ?
and the servant have say , it be my master : therefore she take a vail , and cover herself .
and the servant tell isaac all thing that he have do .
and isaac bring she into he mother sarah 's tent , and take rebekah , and she become he wife ; and he love she : and isaac be comfort after he mother 's death .
then again abraham take a wife , and she name be keturah .
and she bare he zimran , and jokshan , and medan , and midian , and ishbak , and shuah .
and jokshan beget sheba , and dedan .
and the son of dedan be asshurim , and letushim , and leummim .
and the son of midian ; ephah , and epher , and hanoch , and abidah , and eldaah .
all these be the child of keturah .
and abraham give all that he have unto isaac .
but unto the son of the concubine , which abraham have , abraham give gift , and send they away from isaac he son , while he yet live , eastward , unto the east country .
and these be the day of the year of abraham 's life which he live , a hundred threescore and fifteen year .
then abraham give up the ghost , and die in a good old age , a old man , and full of year ; and be gather to he people .
and he son isaac and ishmael bury he in the cave of machpelah , in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite , which be before mamre ;
the field which abraham purchase of the son of heth : there be abraham bury , and sarah he wife .
and it come to pass after the death of abraham , that god bless he son isaac ; and isaac dwelt by the well lahairous .
now these be the generation of ishmael , abraham 's son , whom hagar the egyptian , sarah 's handmaid , bare unto abraham :
and these be the name of the son of ishmael , by they name , accord to they generation : the firstborn of ishmael , nebajoth ; and kedar , and adbeel , and mibsam ,
and mishma , and dumah , and massa ,
hadar , and tema , jetur , naphish , and kedemah :
these be the son of ishmael , and these be they name , by they town , and by they castle ; twelve prince accord to they nation .
and these be the year of the life of ishmael , a hundred and thirty and seven year : and he give up the ghost and die ; and be gather unto he people .
and they dwell from havilah unto shur , that be before egypt , as thou goest toward assyria : and he die in the presence of all he brethren .
and these be the generation of isaac , abraham 's son : abraham beget isaac :
and isaac be forty year old when he take rebekah to wife , the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram , the sister to laban the syrian .
and isaac intreat the lord for he wife , because she be barren : and the lord be intreat of he , and rebekah he wife conceive .
and the child struggle together within she ; and she say , if it be so , why be i thus ?
and she go to enquire of the lord .
and the lord say unto she , two nation be in thy womb , and two manner of people shall be separate from thy bowels ; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people ; and the elder shall serve the younger .
and when she day to be deliver be fulfil , behold , there be twin in she womb .
and the first come out red , all over like a hairy garment ; and they call he name esau .
and after that come he brother out , and he hand take hold on esau 's heel ; and he name be call jacob : and isaac be threescore year old when she bare they .
and the boy grow : and esau be a cunning hunter , a man of the field ; and jacob be a plain man , dwelling in tent .
and isaac love esau , because he do eat of he venison : but rebekah love jacob .
and jacob sod pottage : and esau come from the field , and he be faint :
and esau say to jacob , feed i , i pray thee , with that same red pottage ; for i be faint : therefore be he name call edom .
and jacob say , sell i this day thy birthright .
and esau say , behold , i be at the point to die : and what profit shall this birthright do to i ?
and jacob say , swear to i this day ; and he sware unto he : and he sell he birthright unto jacob .
then jacob give esau bread and pottage of lentile ; and he do eat and drink , and rise up , and go he way : thus esau despise he birthright .
and there be a famine in the land , beside the first famine that be in the day of abraham .
and isaac go unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar .
and the lord appear unto he , and say , go not down into egypt ; dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of :
sojourn in this land , and i will be with thee , and will bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto thy seed , i will give all these country , and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father ;
and i will make thy seed to multiply as the star of heaven , and will give unto thy seed all these country ; and in thy seed shall all the nation of the earth be bless ;
because that abraham obey my voice , and keep my charge , my commandment , my statute , and my law .
and isaac dwelt in gerar :
and the man of the place ask he of he wife ; and he say , she be my sister : for he fear to say , she be my wife ; lest , say he , the man of the place should kill i for rebekah ; because she be fair to look upon .
and it come to pass , when he have be there a long time , that abimelech king of the philistines look out at a window , and see , and , behold , isaac be sport with rebekah he wife .
and abimelech call isaac , and say , behold , of a surety she be thy wife : and how saidst thou , she be my sister ?
and isaac say unto he , because i say , lest i die for she .
and abimelech say , what be this thou hast do unto we ? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife , and thou shouldest have bring guiltiness upon we .
and abimelech charge all he people , say , he that toucheth this man or he wife shall surely be put to death .
then isaac sow in that land , and receive in the same year a hundredfold : and the lord bless he .
and the man wax great , and go forward , and grow until he become very great :
for he have possession of flock , and possession of herd , and great store of servant : and the philistines envy he .
for all the well which he father 's servant have dig in the day of abraham he father , the philistines have stop they , and fill they with earth .
and abimelech say unto isaac , go from we ; for thou art much mightier than we .
and isaac depart thence , and pitch he tent in the valley of gerar , and dwelt there .
and isaac dig again the well of water , which they have dig in the day of abraham he father ; for the philistines have stop they after the death of abraham : and he call they name after the name by which he father have call they .
and isaac 's servant dig in the valley , and find there a well of spring water .
and the herdman of gerar do strive with isaac 's herdman , say , the water be ours : and he call the name of the well esek ; because they strive with he .
and they dig another well , and strove for that also : and he call the name of it sitnah .
and he remove from thence , and dig another well ; and for that they strive not : and he call the name of it rehoboth ; and he say , for now the lord have make room for we , and we shall be fruitful in the land .
and he go up from thence to beersheba .
and the lord appear unto he the same night , and say , i be the god of abraham thy father : fear not , for i be with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant abraham 's sake .
and he build a altar there , and call upon the name of the lord , and pitch he tent there : and there isaac 's servant dig a well .
then abimelech go to he from gerar , and ahuzzath one of he friend , and phichol the chief captain of he army .
and isaac say unto they , wherefore come ye to i , see ye hate i , and have send i away from you ?
and they say , we see certainly that the lord be with thee : and we say , let there be now a oath betwixt we , even betwixt we and thee , and let we make a covenant with thee ;
that thou wilt do we no hurt , as we have not touch thee , and as we have do unto thee nothing but good , and have send thee away in peace : thou art now the bless of the lord .
and he make they a feast , and they do eat and drink .
and they rise up betime in the morning , and sware one to another : and isaac send they away , and they depart from he in peace .
and it come to pass the same day , that isaac 's servant come , and tell he concern the well which they have dig , and say unto he , we have find water .
and he call it shebah : therefore the name of the city be beersheba unto this day .
and esau be forty year old when he take to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite , and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite :
which be a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah .
and it come to pass , that when isaac be old , and he eye be dim , so that he could not see , he call esau he eldest son , and say unto he , my son : and he say unto he , behold , here be i.
and he say , behold now , i be old , i know not the day of my death :
now therefore take , i pray thee , thy weapon , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take i some venison ;
and make i savoury meat , such as i love , and bring it to i , that i may eat ; that my soul may bless thee before i die .
and rebekah hear when isaac spake to esau he son .
and esau go to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
and rebekah spake unto jacob she son , say , behold , i hear thy father speak unto esau thy brother , say ,
bring i venison , and make i savoury meat , that i may eat , and bless thee before the lord before my death .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice accord to that which i command thee .
go now to the flock , and fetch i from thence two good kid of the goat ; and i will make they savoury meat for thy father , such as he loveth :
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before he death .
and jacob say to rebekah he mother , behold , esau my brother be a hairy man , and i be a smooth man :
my father peradventure will feel i , and i shall seem to he as a deceiver ; and i shall bring a curse upon i , and not a blessing .
and he mother say unto he , upon i be thy curse , my son : only obey my voice , and go fetch i they .
and he go , and fetch , and bring they to he mother : and he mother make savoury meat , such as he father love .
and rebekah take goodly raiment of she eldest son esau , which be with she in the house , and put they upon jacob she younger son :
and she put the skin of the kid of the goat upon he hand , and upon the smooth of he neck :
and she give the savoury meat and the bread , which she have prepare , into the hand of she son jacob .
and he come unto he father , and say , my father : and he say , here be i ; who art thou , my son ?
and jacob say unto he father , i be esau thy first bear ; i have do accord as thou badest i : arise , i pray thee , sit and eat of my venison , that thy soul may bless i .
and isaac say unto he son , how be it that thou hast find it so quickly , my son ?
and he say , because the lord thy god bring it to i .
and isaac say unto jacob , come near , i pray thee , that i may feel thee , my son , whether thou be my very son esau or not .
and jacob go near unto isaac he father ; and he feel he , and say , the voice be jacob 's voice , but the hand be the hand of esau .
and he discern he not , because he hand be hairy , as he brother esau 's hand : so he bless he .
and he say , art thou my very son esau ?
and he say , i be .
and he say , bring it near to i , and i will eat of my son 's venison , that my soul may bless thee .
and he bring it near to he , and he do eat : and he bring he wine , and he drink .
and he father isaac say unto he , come near now , and kiss i , my son .
and he come near , and kiss he : and he smell the smell of he raiment , and bless he , and say , see , the smell of my son be as the smell of a field which the lord have bless :
therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven , and the fatness of the earth , and plenty of corn and wine :
let people serve thee , and nation bow down to thee : be lord over thy brethren , and let thy mother 's son bow down to thee : curse be every one that curseth thee , and bless be he that blesseth thee .
and it come to pass , as soon as isaac have make a end of blessing jacob , and jacob be yet scarce go out from the presence of isaac he father , that esau he brother come in from he hunting .
and he also have make savoury meat , and bring it unto he father , and say unto he father , let my father arise , and eat of he son 's venison , that thy soul may bless i .
and isaac he father say unto he , who art thou ?
and he say , i be thy son , thy firstborn esau .
and isaac tremble very exceedingly , and say , who ? where be he that have take venison , and bring it i , and i have eat of all before thou camest , and have bless he ? yea , and he shall be bless .
and when esau hear the word of he father , he cry with a great and exceed bitter cry , and say unto he father , bless i , even i also , o my father .
and he say , thy brother come with subtilty , and have take away thy blessing .
and he say , be not he rightly name jacob ? for he have supplant i these two time : he take away my birthright ; and , behold , now he have take away my blessing .
and he say , hast thou not reserve a blessing for i ?
and isaac answer and say unto esau , behold , i have make he thy lord , and all he brethren have i give to he for servant ; and with corn and wine have i sustain he : and what shall i do now unto thee , my son ?
and esau say unto he father , hast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless i , even i also , o my father .
and esau lift up he voice , and weep .
and isaac he father answer and say unto he , behold , thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break he yoke from off thy neck .
and esau hate jacob because of the blessing wherewith he father bless he : and esau say in he heart , the day of mourning for my father be at hand ; then will i slay my brother jacob .
and these word of esau she elder son be tell to rebekah : and she send and call jacob she younger son , and say unto he , behold , thy brother esau , as touching thee , doth comfort himself , purpose to kill thee .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to laban my brother to haran ;
and tarry with he a few day , until thy brother 's fury turn away ;
until thy brother 's anger turn away from thee , and he forget that which thou hast do to he : then i will send , and fetch thee from thence : why should i be deprive also of you both in one day ?
and rebekah say to isaac , i be weary of my life because of the daughter of heth : if jacob take a wife of the daughter of heth , such as these which be of the daughter of the land , what good shall my life do i ?
and isaac call jacob , and bless he , and charge he , and say unto he , thou shalt not take a wife of the daughter of canaan .
arise , go to padanaram , to the house of bethuel thy mother 's father ; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughter of laban thy mother 's brother .
and god almighty bless thee , and make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a multitude of people ;
and give thee the blessing of abraham , to thee , and to thy seed with thee ; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger , which god give unto abraham .
and isaac send away jacob : and he go to padanaram unto laban , son of bethuel the syrian , the brother of rebekah , jacob 's and esau 's mother .
when esau see that isaac have bless jacob , and send he away to padanaram , to take he a wife from thence ; and that as he bless he he give he a charge , say , thou shalt not take a wife of the daughter of canaan ;
and that jacob obey he father and he mother , and be go to padanaram ;
and esau see that the daughter of canaan please not isaac he father ;
then go esau unto ishmael , and take unto the wife which he have mahalath the daughter of ishmael abraham 's son , the sister of nebajoth , to be he wife .
and jacob go out from beersheba , and go toward haran .
and he light upon a certain place , and tarry there all night , because the sun be set ; and he take of the stone of that place , and put they for he pillow , and lay down in that place to sleep .
and he dream , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reach to heaven : and behold the angel of god ascend and descend on it .
and , behold , the lord stand above it , and say , i be the lord god of abraham thy father , and the god of isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will i give it , and to thy seed ;
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in thee and in thy seed shall all the family of the earth be bless .
and , behold , i be with thee , and will keep thee in all place whither thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for i will not leave thee , until i have do that which i have speak to thee of .
and jacob awake out of he sleep , and he say , surely the lord be in this place ; and i know it not .
and he be afraid , and say , how dreadful be this place ! this be none other but the house of god , and this be the gate of heaven .
and jacob rise up early in the morning , and take the stone that he have put for he pillow , and set it up for a pillar , and pour oil upon the top of it .
and he call the name of that place bethel : but the name of that city be call luz at the first .
and jacob vow a vow , say , if god will be with i , and will keep i in this way that i go , and will give i bread to eat , and raiment to put on ,
so that i come again to my father 's house in peace ; then shall the lord be my god :
and this stone , which i have set for a pillar , shall be god 's house : and of all that thou shalt give i i will surely give the tenth unto thee .
then jacob go on he journey , and come into the land of the people of the east .
and he look , and behold a well in the field , and , lo , there be three flock of sheep lie by it ; for out of that well they water the flock : and a great stone be upon the well 's mouth .
and thither be all the flock gather : and they roll the stone from the well 's mouth , and water the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in he place .
and jacob say unto they , my brethren , whence be ye ?
and they say , of haran be we .
and he say unto they , know ye laban the son of nahor ?
and they say , we know he .
and he say unto they , be he well ?
and they say , he be well : and , behold , rachel he daughter cometh with the sheep .
and he say , lo , it be yet high day , neither be it time that the cattle should be gather together : water ye the sheep , and go and feed they .
and they say , we can not , until all the flock be gather together , and till they roll the stone from the well 's mouth ; then we water the sheep .
and while he yet speak with they , rachel come with she father 's sheep : for she keep they .
and it come to pass , when jacob see rachel the daughter of laban he mother 's brother , and the sheep of laban he mother 's brother , that jacob go near , and roll the stone from the well 's mouth , and water the flock of laban he mother 's brother .
and jacob kiss rachel , and lift up he voice , and weep .
and jacob tell rachel that he be she father 's brother , and that he be rebekah 's son : and she run and tell she father .
and it come to pass , when laban hear the tiding of jacob he sister 's son , that he run to meet he , and embrace he , and kiss he , and bring he to he house .
and he tell laban all these thing .
and laban say to he , surely thou art my bone and my flesh .
and he abode with he the space of a month .
and laban say unto jacob , because thou art my brother , shouldest thou therefore serve i for nought ? tell i , what shall thy wages be ?
and laban have two daughter : the name of the elder be leah , and the name of the younger be rachel .
leah be tender eye ; but rachel be beautiful and well favoured .
and jacob love rachel ; and say , i will serve thee seven year for rachel thy younger daughter .
and laban say , it be better that i give she to thee , than that i should give she to another man : abide with i .
and jacob serve seven year for rachel ; and they seem unto he but a few day , for the love he have to she .
and jacob say unto laban , give i my wife , for my day be fulfil , that i may go in unto she .
and laban gather together all the man of the place , and make a feast .
and it come to pass in the evening , that he take leah he daughter , and bring she to he ; and he go in unto she .
and laban give unto he daughter leah zilpah he maid for a handmaid .
and it come to pass , that in the morning , behold , it be leah : and he say to laban , what be this thou hast do unto i ? do not i serve with thee for rachel ? wherefore then hast thou beguile i ?
and laban say , it must not be so do in we country , to give the younger before the firstborn .
fulfil she week , and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with i yet seven other year .
and jacob do so , and fulfil she week : and he give he rachel he daughter to wife also .
and laban give to rachel he daughter bilhah he handmaid to be she maid .
and he go in also unto rachel , and he love also rachel more than leah , and serve with he yet seven other year .
and when the lord see that leah be hate , he open she womb : but rachel be barren .
and leah conceive , and bare a son , and she call he name reuben : for she say , surely the lord have look upon my affliction ; now therefore my husband will love i .
and she conceive again , and bare a son ; and say , because the lord have hear that i be hate , he have therefore give i this son also : and she call he name simeon .
and she conceive again , and bare a son ; and say , now this time will my husband be join unto i , because i have bear he three son : therefore be he name call levi .
and she conceive again , and bare a son : and she say , now will i praise the lord : therefore she call he name judah ; and leave bearing .
and when rachel see that she bare jacob no child , rachel envy she sister ; and say unto jacob , give i child , or else i die .
and jacob 's anger be kindle against rachel : and he say , be i in god 's stead , who have withhold from thee the fruit of the womb ?
and she say , behold my maid bilhah , go in unto she ; and she shall bear upon my knee , that i may also have child by she .
and she give he bilhah she handmaid to wife : and jacob go in unto she .
and bilhah conceive , and bare jacob a son .
and rachel say , god have judge i , and have also hear my voice , and have give i a son : therefore call she he name dan .

and zilpah leah 's maid bare jacob a son .
and leah say , a troop cometh : and she call he name gad .
and zilpah leah 's maid bare jacob a second son .
and leah say , happy be i , for the daughter will call i bless : and she call he name asher .
and reuben go in the day of wheat harvest , and find mandrake in the field , and bring they unto he mother leah .
then rachel say to leah , give i , i pray thee , of thy son 's mandrake .
and she say unto she , be it a small matter that thou hast take my husband ? and wouldest thou take away my son 's mandrake also ?
and rachel say , therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son 's mandrake .
and jacob come out of the field in the evening , and leah go out to meet he , and say , thou must come in unto i ; for surely i have hire thee with my son 's mandrake .
and he lay with she that night .
and god hearken unto leah , and she conceive , and bare jacob the fifth son .
and leah say , god have give i my hire , because i have give my maiden to my husband : and she call he name issachar .
and leah conceive again , and bare jacob the sixth son .

and afterwards she bare a daughter , and call she name dinah .
and god remember rachel , and god hearken to she , and open she womb .
and she conceive , and bare a son ; and say , god have take away my reproach :
and she call he name joseph ; and say , the lord shall add to i another son .
and it come to pass , when rachel have bear joseph , that jacob say unto laban , send i away , that i may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
give i my wife and my child , for whom i have serve thee , and let i go : for thou knowest my service which i have do thee .
and laban say unto he , i pray thee , if i have find favour in thine eye , tarry : for i have learn by experience that the lord have bless i for thy sake .
and he say , appoint i thy wages , and i will give it .
and he say unto he , thou knowest how i have serve thee , and how thy cattle be with i .
for it be little which thou hadst before i come , and it be now increase unto a multitude ; and the lord have bless thee since my come : and now when shall i provide for mine own house also ?
and he say , what shall i give thee ?
and jacob say , thou shalt not give i any thing : if thou wilt do this thing for i , i will again feed and keep thy flock .
i will pass through all thy flock to day , remove from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle , and all the brown cattle among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goat : and of such shall be my hire .
so shall my righteousness answer for i in time to come , when it shall come for my hire before thy face : every one that be not speckled and spot among the goat , and brown among the sheep , that shall be count steal with i .
and laban say , behold , i would it might be accord to thy word .
and he remove that day the he goat that be ringstraked and spotted , and all the she goat that be speckled and spotted , and every one that have some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and give they into the hand of he son .
and he set three day ' journey betwixt himself and jacob : and jacob feed the rest of laban 's flock .
and jacob take he rod of green poplar , and of the hazel and chestnut tree ; and pill white strake in they , and make the white appear which be in the rod .
and he set the rod which he have pill before the flock in the gutter in the water trough when the flock come to drink , that they should conceive when they come to drink .
and the flock conceive before the rod , and bring forth cattle ringstrake , speckled , and spot .
and jacob do separate the lamb , and set the face of the flock toward the ringstraked , and all the brown in the flock of laban ; and he put he own flock by themselves , and put they not unto laban 's cattle .
and it come to pass , whensoever the stronger cattle do conceive , that jacob lay the rod before the eye of the cattle in the gutter , that they might conceive among the rod .
but when the cattle be feeble , he put they not in : so the feebler be laban 's , and the stronger jacob 's .
and the man increase exceedingly , and have much cattle , and maidservant , and manservant , and camel , and ass .
and he hear the word of laban 's son , say , jacob have take away all that be we father 's ; and of that which be we father 's have he get all this glory .
and jacob behold the countenance of laban , and , behold , it be not toward he as before .
and the lord say unto jacob , return unto the land of thy father , and to thy kindred ; and i will be with thee .
and jacob send and call rachel and leah to the field unto he flock ,
and say unto they , i see you father 's countenance , that it be not toward i as before ; but the god of my father have be with i .
and ye know that with all my power i have serve you father .
and you father have deceive i , and change my wages ten time ; but god suffer he not to hurt i .
if he say thus , the speckled shall be thy wages ; then all the cattle bare speckled : and if he say thus , the ringstraked shall be thy hire ; then bare all the cattle ringstrake .
thus god have take away the cattle of you father , and give they to i .
and it come to pass at the time that the cattle conceive , that i lift up mine eye , and see in a dream , and , behold , the ram which leap upon the cattle be ringstraked , speckled , and grisle .
and the angel of god speak unto i in a dream , say , jacob : and i say , here be i.
and he say , lift up now thine eye , and see , all the ram which leap upon the cattle be ringstraked , speckled , and grisle : for i have see all that laban doeth unto thee .
i be the god of bethel , where thou anointedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow unto i : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kindred .
and rachel and leah answer and say unto he , be there yet any portion or inheritance for we in we father 's house ?
be we not count of he stranger ? for he have sell we , and have quite devour also we money .
for all the riches which god have take from we father , that be ours , and we child 's : now then , whatsoever god have say unto thee , do .
then jacob rise up , and set he son and he wife upon camel ;
and he carry away all he cattle , and all he goods which he have get , the cattle of he get , which he have get in padanaram , for to go to isaac he father in the land of canaan .
and laban go to shear he sheep : and rachel have steal the image that be she father 's .
and jacob steal away unawares to laban the syrian , in that he tell he not that he flee .
so he flee with all that he have ; and he rise up , and pass over the river , and set he face toward the mount gilead .
and it be tell laban on the third day that jacob be flee .
and he take he brethren with he , and pursue after he seven day ' journey ; and they overtake he in the mount gilead .
and god come to laban the syrian in a dream by night , and say unto he , take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad .
then laban overtook jacob .
now jacob have pitch he tent in the mount : and laban with he brethren pitch in the mount of gilead .
and laban say to jacob , what hast thou do , that thou hast steal away unaware to i , and carry away my daughter , as captive take with the sword ?
wherefore didst thou flee away secretly , and steal away from i ; and do not tell i , that i might have send thee away with mirth , and with song , with tabret , and with harp ?
and hast not suffer i to kiss my son and my daughter ? thou hast now do foolishly in so do .
it be in the power of my hand to do you hurt : but the god of you father speak unto i yesternight , say , take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad .
and now , though thou wouldest need be go , because thou sore longedst after thy father 's house , yet wherefore hast thou steal my god ?
and jacob answer and say to laban , because i be afraid : for i say , peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughter from i .
with whomsoever thou findest thy god , let he not live : before we brethren discern thou what be thine with i , and take it to thee .
for jacob know not that rachel have steal they .
and laban go into jacob 's tent , and into leah 's tent , and into the two maidservant ' tent ; but he find they not .
then go he out of leah 's tent , and enter into rachel 's tent .
now rachel have take the image , and put they in the camel 's furniture , and sit upon they .
and laban search all the tent , but find they not .
and she say to she father , let it not displease my lord that i can not rise up before thee ; for the custom of woman be upon i .
and he search , but find not the image .
and jacob be wroth , and chode with laban : and jacob answer and say to laban , what be my trespass ? what be my sin , that thou hast so hotly pursue after i ?
whereas thou hast search all my stuff , what hast thou find of all thy household stuff ? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren , that they may judge betwixt we both .
this twenty year have i be with thee ; thy ewe and thy she goat have not cast they young , and the ram of thy flock have i not eat .
that which be tear of beast i bring not unto thee ; i bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether steal by day , or steal by night .
thus i be ; in the day the drought consume i , and the frost by night ; and my sleep depart from mine eye .
thus have i be twenty year in thy house ; i serve thee fourteen year for thy two daughter , and six year for thy cattle : and thou hast change my wages ten time .
except the god of my father , the god of abraham , and the fear of isaac , have be with i , surely thou hadst send i away now empty .
god have see mine affliction and the labour of my hand , and rebuke thee yesternight .
and laban answer and say unto jacob , these daughter be my daughter , and these child be my child , and these cattle be my cattle , and all that thou seest be mine : and what can i do this day unto these my daughter , or unto they child which they have bear ?
now therefore come thou , let we make a covenant , i and thou ; and let it be for a witness between i and thee .
and jacob take a stone , and set it up for a pillar .
and jacob say unto he brethren , gather stone ; and they take stone , and make a heap : and they do eat there upon the heap .
and laban call it jegarsahadutha : but jacob call it galeed .
and laban say , this heap be a witness between i and thee this day .
therefore be the name of it call galeed ;
and mizpah ; for he say , the lord watch between i and thee , when we be absent one from another .
if thou shalt afflict my daughter , or if thou shalt take other wife beside my daughter , no man be with we ; see , god be witness betwixt i and thee .
and laban say to jacob , behold this heap , and behold this pillar , which i have cast betwixt i and thee :
this heap be witness , and this pillar be witness , that i will not pass over this heap to thee , and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto i , for harm .
the god of abraham , and the god of nahor , the god of they father , judge betwixt we .
and jacob sware by the fear of he father isaac .
then jacob offer sacrifice upon the mount , and call he brethren to eat bread : and they do eat bread , and tarry all night in the mount .
and early in the morning laban rise up , and kiss he son and he daughter , and bless they : and laban depart , and return unto he place .
and jacob go on he way , and the angel of god meet he .
and when jacob see they , he say , this be god 's host : and he call the name of that place mahanaim .
and jacob send messenger before he to esau he brother unto the land of seir , the country of edom .
and he command they , say , thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau ; thy servant jacob saith thus , i have sojourn with laban , and stay there until now :
and i have oxen , and ass , flock , and manservant , and womenservant : and i have send to tell my lord , that i may find grace in thy sight .
and the messenger return to jacob , say , we come to thy brother esau , and also he cometh to meet thee , and four hundred man with he .
then jacob be greatly afraid and distressed : and he divide the people that be with he , and the flock , and herd , and the camel , into two band ;
and say , if esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the other company which be leave shall escape .
and jacob say , o god of my father abraham , and god of my father isaac , the lord which saidst unto i , return unto thy country , and to thy kindred , and i will deal well with thee :
i be not worthy of the least of all the mercy , and of all the truth , which thou hast shew unto thy servant ; for with my staff i pass over this jordan ; and now i be become two band .
deliver i , i pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of esau : for i fear he , lest he will come and smite i , and the mother with the child .
and thou saidst , i will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which can not be number for multitude .
and he lodge there that same night ; and take of that which come to he hand a present for esau he brother ;
two hundred she goat , and twenty he goat , two hundred ewe , and twenty ram ,
thirty milch camel with they colt , forty kine , and ten bull , twenty she ass , and ten foal .
and he deliver they into the hand of he servant , every drive by themselves ; and say unto he servant , pass over before i , and put a space betwixt drive and drive .
and he command the foremost , say , when esau my brother meeteth thee , and asketh thee , say , whose art thou ? and whither goest thou ? and whose be these before thee ?
then thou shalt say , they be thy servant jacob 's ; it be a present send unto my lord esau : and , behold , also he be behind we .
and so command he the second , and the third , and all that follow the drove , say , on this manner shall ye speak unto esau , when ye find he .
and say ye moreover , behold , thy servant jacob be behind we .
for he say , i will appease he with the present that goeth before i , and afterward i will see he face ; peradventure he will accept of i .
so go the present over before he : and himself lodge that night in the company .
and he rise up that night , and take he two wife , and he two womenservant , and he eleven son , and pass over the ford jabbok .
and he take they , and send they over the brook , and send over that he have .
and jacob be leave alone ; and there wrestle a man with he until the breaking of the day .
and when he see that he prevail not against he , he touch the hollow of he thigh ; and the hollow of jacob 's thigh be out of joint , as he wrestle with he .
and he say , let i go , for the day breaketh .
and he say , i will not let thee go , except thou bless i .
and he say unto he , what be thy name ?
and he say , jacob .
and he say , thy name shall be call no more jacob , but israel : for as a prince hast thou power with god and with man , and hast prevail .
and jacob ask he , and say , tell i , i pray thee , thy name .
and he say , wherefore be it that thou dost ask after my name ?
and he bless he there .
and jacob call the name of the place peniel : for i have see god face to face , and my life be preserve .
and as he pass over penuel the sun rise upon he , and he halt upon he thigh .
therefore the child of israel eat not of the sinew which shrink , which be upon the hollow of the thigh , unto this day : because he touch the hollow of jacob 's thigh in the sinew that shrink .
and jacob lift up he eye , and look , and , behold , esau come , and with he four hundred man .
and he divide the child unto leah , and unto rachel , and unto the two handmaid .
and he put the handmaid and they child foremost , and leah and she child after , and rachel and joseph hindermost .
and he pass over before they , and bow himself to the ground seven time , until he come near to he brother .
and esau run to meet he , and embrace he , and fall on he neck , and kiss he : and they weep .
and he lift up he eye , and see the woman and the child ; and say , who be those with thee ?
and he say , the child which god have graciously give thy servant .
then the handmaiden come near , they and they child , and they bow themselves .
and leah also with she child come near , and bow themselves : and after come joseph near and rachel , and they bow themselves .
and he say , what meanest thou by all this drive which i meet ?
and he say , these be to find grace in the sight of my lord .
and esau say , i have enough , my brother ; keep that thou hast unto thyself .
and jacob say , nay , i pray thee , if now i have find grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore i have see thy face , as though i have see the face of god , and thou wast please with i .
take , i pray thee , my blessing that be bring to thee ; because god have deal graciously with i , and because i have enough .
and he urge he , and he take it .
and he say , let we take we journey , and let we go , and i will go before thee .
and he say unto he , my lord knoweth that the child be tender , and the flock and herd with young be with i : and if man should overdrive they one day , all the flock will die .
let my lord , i pray thee , pass over before he servant : and i will lead on softly , accord as the cattle that goeth before i and the child be able to endure , until i come unto my lord unto seir .
and esau say , let i now leave with thee some of the folk that be with i .
and he say , what needeth it ? let i find grace in the sight of my lord .
so esau return that day on he way unto seir .
and jacob journey to succoth , and build he a house , and make booth for he cattle : therefore the name of the place be call succoth .
and jacob come to shalem , a city of shechem , which be in the land of canaan , when he come from padanaram ; and pitch he tent before the city .
and he buy a parcel of a field , where he have spread he tent , at the hand of the child of hamor , shechem 's father , for a hundred piece of money .
and he erect there a altar , and call it eleloheisrael .
and dinah the daughter of leah , which she bare unto jacob , go out to see the daughter of the land .
and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite , prince of the country , see she , he take she , and lay with she , and defile she .
and he soul cleave unto dinah the daughter of jacob , and he love the damsel , and spake kindly unto the damsel .
and shechem speak unto he father hamor , say , get i this damsel to wife .
and jacob hear that he have defile dinah he daughter : now he son be with he cattle in the field : and jacob hold he peace until they be come .
and hamor the father of shechem go out unto jacob to commune with he .
and the son of jacob come out of the field when they hear it : and the man be grieve , and they be very wroth , because he have work folly in israel in lie with jacob 's daughter ; which thing ought not to be do .
and hamor commune with they , say , the soul of my son shechem longeth for you daughter : i pray you give she he to wife .
and make ye marriage with we , and give you daughter unto we , and take we daughter unto you .
and ye shall dwell with we : and the land shall be before you ; dwell and trade ye therein , and get you possession therein .
and shechem say unto she father and unto she brethren , let i find grace in you eye , and what ye shall say unto i i will give .
ask i never so much dowry and gift , and i will give accord as ye shall say unto i : but give i the damsel to wife .
and the son of jacob answer shechem and hamor he father deceitfully , and say , because he have defile dinah they sister :
and they say unto they , we can not do this thing , to give we sister to one that be uncircumcised ; for that be a reproach unto we :
but in this will we consent unto you : if ye will be as we be , that every male of you be circumcise ;
then will we give we daughter unto you , and we will take you daughter to we , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if ye will not hearken unto we , to be circumcise ; then will we take we daughter , and we will be go .
and they word pleased hamor , and shechem hamor 's son .
and the young man defer not to do the thing , because he have delight in jacob 's daughter : and he be more honourable than all the house of he father .
and hamor and shechem he son come unto the gate of they city , and commune with the man of they city , say ,
these man be peaceable with we ; therefore let they dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it be large enough for they ; let we take they daughter to we for wife , and let we give they we daughter .
only herein will the man consent unto we for to dwell with we , to be one people , if every male among we be circumcise , as they be circumcise .
shall not they cattle and they substance and every beast of theirs be ours ? only let we consent unto they , and they will dwell with we .
and unto hamor and unto shechem he son hearken all that go out of the gate of he city ; and every male be circumcise , all that go out of the gate of he city .
and it come to pass on the third day , when they be sore , that two of the son of jacob , simeon and levi , dinah 's brethren , take each man he sword , and come upon the city boldly , and slew all the male .
and they slew hamor and shechem he son with the edge of the sword , and take dinah out of shechem 's house , and go out .
the son of jacob come upon the slay , and spoil the city , because they have defile they sister .
they take they sheep , and they ox , and they ass , and that which be in the city , and that which be in the field ,
and all they wealth , and all they little one , and they wife take they captive , and spoil even all that be in the house .
and jacob say to simeon and levi , ye have trouble i to make i to stink among the inhabitant of the land , among the canaanites and the perizzites : and i be few in number , they shall gather themselves together against i , and slay i ; and i shall be destroy , i and my house .
and they say , should he deal with we sister as with a harlot ?
and god say unto jacob , arise , go up to bethel , and dwell there : and make there a altar unto god , that appear unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother .
then jacob say unto he household , and to all that be with he , put away the strange god that be among you , and be clean , and change you garment :
and let we arise , and go up to bethel ; and i will make there a altar unto god , who answer i in the day of my distress , and be with i in the way which i go .
and they give unto jacob all the strange god which be in they hand , and all they earring which be in they ear ; and jacob hide they under the oak which be by shechem .
and they journey : and the terror of god be upon the city that be round about they , and they do not pursue after the son of jacob .
so jacob come to luz , which be in the land of canaan , that be , bethel , he and all the people that be with he .
and he build there a altar , and call the place elbethel : because there god appear unto he , when he flee from the face of he brother .
but deborah rebekah 's nurse die , and she be bury beneath bethel under a oak : and the name of it be call allonbachuth .
and god appear unto jacob again , when he come out of padanaram , and bless he .
and god say unto he , thy name be jacob : thy name shall not be call any more jacob , but israel shall be thy name : and he call he name israel .
and god say unto he , i be god almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nation shall be of thee , and king shall come out of thy loin ;
and the land which i give abraham and isaac , to thee i will give it , and to thy seed after thee will i give the land .
and god go up from he in the place where he talk with he .
and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talk with he , even a pillar of stone : and he pour a drink offering thereon , and he pour oil thereon .
and jacob call the name of the place where god spake with he , bethel .
and they journey from bethel ; and there be but a little way to come to ephrath : and rachel travail , and she have hard labour .
and it come to pass , when she be in hard labour , that the midwife say unto she , fear not ; thou shalt have this son also .
and it come to pass , as she soul be in depart , ( for she die ) that she call he name benoni : but he father call he benjamin .
and rachel die , and be bury in the way to ephrath , which be bethlehem .
and jacob set a pillar upon she grave : that be the pillar of rachel 's grave unto this day .
and israel journey , and spread he tent beyond the tower of edar .
and it come to pass , when israel dwelt in that land , that reuben go and lay with bilhah he father 's concubine : and israel hear it .

joseph , be seventeen year old , be feed the flock with he brethren ; and the lad be with the son of bilhah , and with the son of zilpah , he father 's wife : and joseph bring unto he father they evil report .
now israel love joseph more than all he child , because he be the son of he old age : and he make he a coat of many colour .
and when he brethren see that they father love he more than all he brethren , they hate he , and could not speak peaceably unto he .
and joseph dream a dream , and he tell it he brethren : and they hate he yet the more .
and he say unto they , hear , i pray you , this dream which i have dream :
for , behold , we be bind sheaf in the field , and , lo , my sheaf arise , and also stand upright ; and , behold , you sheaf stand round about , and make obeisance to my sheaf .
and he brethren say to he , shalt thou indeed reign over we ? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over we ?
and they hate he yet the more for he dream , and for he word .
and he dream yet another dream , and tell it he brethren , and say , behold , i have dream a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven star make obeisance to i .
and he tell it to he father , and to he brethren : and he father rebuke he , and say unto he , what be this dream that thou hast dream ?
shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth ?
and he brethren envy he ; but he father observe the say .
and he brethren go to feed they father 's flock in shechem .
and israel say unto joseph , do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem ? come , and i will send thee unto they .
and he say to he , here be i.
and he say to he , go , i pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren , and well with the flock ; and bring i word again .
so he send he out of the vale of hebron , and he come to shechem .
and a certain man find he , and , behold , he be wander in the field : and the man ask he , say , what seekest thou ?
and he say , i seek my brethren : tell i , i pray thee , where they feed they flock .
and the man say , they be depart hence ; for i hear they say , let we go to dothan .
and joseph go after he brethren , and find they in dothan .
and when they see he afar off , even before he come near unto they , they conspire against he to slay he .
and they say one to another , behold , this dreamer cometh .
come now therefore , and let we slay he , and cast he into some pit , and we will say , some evil beast have devour he : and we shall see what will become of he dream .
and reuben hear it , and he deliver he out of they hand ; and say , let we not kill he .
and reuben say unto they , shed no blood , but cast he into this pit that be in the wilderness , and lay no hand upon he ; that he might rid he out of they hand , to deliver he to he father again .
and it come to pass , when joseph be come unto he brethren , that they stript joseph out of he coat , he coat of many colour that be on he ;
and they take he , and cast he into a pit : and the pit be empty , there be no water in it .
and they sit down to eat bread : and they lift up they eye and look , and , behold , a company of ishmeelites come from gilead with they camel bear spicery and balm and myrrh , go to carry it down to egypt .
and judah say unto he brethren , what profit be it if we slay we brother , and conceal he blood ?
come , and let we sell he to the ishmeelites , and let not we hand be upon he ; for he be we brother and we flesh .
and he brethren be content .
then there pass by midianites merchantman ; and they draw and lift up joseph out of the pit , and sell joseph to the ishmeelites for twenty piece of silver : and they bring joseph into egypt .
and reuben return unto the pit ; and , behold , joseph be not in the pit ; and he rent he clothes .
and he return unto he brethren , and say , the child be not ; and i , whither shall i go ?
and they take joseph 's coat , and kill a kid of the goat , and dip the coat in the blood ;
and they send the coat of many colour , and they bring it to they father ; and say , this have we find : know now whether it be thy son 's coat or no. .
and he know it , and say , it be my son 's coat ; a evil beast have devour he ; joseph be without doubt rent in piece .
and jacob rent he clothes , and put sackcloth upon he loin , and mourn for he son many day .
and all he son and all he daughter rise up to comfort he ; but he refuse to be comfort ; and he say , for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning .
thus he father weep for he .
and the midianites sell he into egypt unto potiphar , a officer of pharaoh 's , and captain of the guard .
and it come to pass at that time , that judah go down from he brethren , and turn in to a certain adullamite , whose name be hirah .
and judah see there a daughter of a certain canaanite , whose name be shuah ; and he take she , and go in unto she .
and she conceive , and bare a son ; and he call he name er .
and she conceive again , and bare a son ; and she call he name onan .
and she yet again conceive , and bare a son ; and call he name shelah : and he be at chezib , when she bare he .
and judah take a wife for er he firstborn , whose name be tamar .
and er , judah 's firstborn , be wicked in the sight of the lord ; and the lord slew he .
and judah say unto onan , go in unto thy brother 's wife , and marry she , and raise up seed to thy brother .
and onan know that the seed should not be he ; and it come to pass , when he go in unto he brother 's wife , that he spill it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to he brother .
and the thing which he do displeased the lord : wherefore he slew he also .
then say judah to tamar he daughter in law , remain a widow at thy father 's house , till shelah my son be grow : for he say , lest peradventure he die also , as he brethren do .
and tamar go and dwelt in she father 's house .
and in process of time the daughter of shuah judah 's wife die ; and judah be comfort , and go up unto he sheepshearer to timnath , he and he friend hirah the adullamite .
and it be tell tamar , say , behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear he sheep .
and she put she widow 's garment off from she , and cover she with a vail , and wrap herself , and sit in a open place , which be by the way to timnath ; for she see that shelah be grow , and she be not give unto he to wife .
when judah see she , he think she to be a harlot ; because she have cover she face .
and he turn unto she by the way , and say , go to , i pray thee , let i come in unto thee ; ( for he know not that she be he daughter in law . )
and she say , what wilt thou give i , that thou mayest come in unto i ?
and he say , i will send thee a kid from the flock .
and she say , wilt thou give i a pledge , till thou send it ?
and he say , what pledge shall i give thee ?
and she say , thy signet , and thy bracelet , and thy staff that be in thine hand .
and he give it she , and come in unto she , and she conceive by he .
and she arise , and go away , and lay by she vail from she , and put on the garment of she widowhood .
and judah send the kid by the hand of he friend the adullamite , to receive he pledge from the woman 's hand : but he find she not .
then he ask the man of that place , say , where be the harlot , that be openly by the way side ?
and they say , there be no harlot in this place .
and he return to judah , and say , i can not find she ; and also the man of the place say , that there be no harlot in this place .
and judah say , let she take it to she , lest we be shame : behold , i send this kid , and thou hast not find she .
and it come to pass about three month after , that it be tell judah , say , tamar thy daughter in law have play the harlot ; and also , behold , she be with child by whoredom .
and judah say , bring she forth , and let she be burn .
when she be bring forth , she send to she father in law , say , by the man , whose these be , be i with child : and she say , discern , i pray thee , whose be these , the signet , and bracelet , and staff .
and judah acknowledge they , and say , she have be more righteous than i ; because that i give she not to shelah my son .
and he know she again no more .
and it come to pass in the time of she travail , that , behold , twin be in she womb .
and it come to pass , when she travail , that the one put out he hand : and the midwife take and bind upon he hand a scarlet thread , say , this come out first .
and it come to pass , as he draw back he hand , that , behold , he brother come out : and she say , how hast thou break forth ? this breach be upon thee : therefore he name be call pharez .
and afterward come out he brother , that have the scarlet thread upon he hand : and he name be call zarah .
and joseph be bring down to egypt ; and potiphar , a officer of pharaoh , captain of the guard , a egyptian , buy he of the hand of the ishmeelites , which have bring he down thither .
and the lord be with joseph , and he be a prosperous man ; and he be in the house of he master the egyptian .
and he master see that the lord be with he , and that the lord make all that he do to prosper in he hand .
and joseph find grace in he sight , and he serve he : and he make he overseer over he house , and all that he have he put into he hand .
and it come to pass from the time that he have make he overseer in he house , and over all that he have , that the lord bless the egyptian 's house for joseph 's sake ; and the blessing of the lord be upon all that he have in the house , and in the field .
and he leave all that he have in joseph 's hand ; and he know not ought he have , save the bread which he do eat .
and joseph be a goodly person , and well favoured .
and it come to pass after these thing , that he master 's wife cast she eye upon joseph ; and she say , lie with i .
but he refuse , and say unto he master 's wife , behold , my master wotteth not what be with i in the house , and he have commit all that he have to my hand ;
there be none greater in this house than i ; neither have he keep back any thing from i but thee , because thou art he wife : how then can i do this great wickedness , and sin against god ?
and it come to pass , as she speak to joseph day by day , that he hearken not unto she , to lie by she , or to be with she .
and it come to pass about this time , that joseph go into the house to do he business ; and there be none of the man of the house there within .
and she catch he by he garment , say , lie with i : and he leave he garment in she hand , and flee , and get he out .
and it come to pass , when she see that he have leave he garment in she hand , and be flee forth ,
that she call unto the man of she house , and spake unto they , say , see , he have bring in a hebrew unto we to mock we ; he come in unto i to lie with i , and i cry with a loud voice :
and it come to pass , when he hear that i lift up my voice and cry , that he leave he garment with i , and flee , and get he out .
and she lay up he garment by she , until he lord come home .
and she speak unto he accord to these word , say , the hebrew servant , which thou hast bring unto we , come in unto i to mock i :
and it come to pass , as i lift up my voice and cry , that he leave he garment with i , and flee out .
and it come to pass , when he master hear the word of he wife , which she speak unto he , say , after this manner do thy servant to i ; that he wrath be kindle .
and joseph 's master take he , and put he into the prison , a place where the king 's prisoner be bind : and he be there in the prison .
but the lord be with joseph , and shew he mercy , and give he favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
and the keeper of the prison commit to joseph 's hand all the prisoner that be in the prison ; and whatsoever they do there , he be the doer of it .
the keeper of the prison look not to any thing that be under he hand ; because the lord be with he , and that which he do , the lord make it to prosper .
and it come to pass after these thing , that the butler of the king of egypt and he baker have offend they lord the king of egypt .
and pharaoh be wroth against two of he officer , against the chief of the butler , and against the chief of the baker .
and he put they in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where joseph be bind .
and the captain of the guard charge joseph with they , and he serve they : and they continue a season in ward .
and they dream a dream both of they , each man he dream in one night , each man accord to the interpretation of he dream , the butler and the baker of the king of egypt , which be bind in the prison .
and joseph come in unto they in the morning , and look upon they , and , behold , they be sad .
and he ask pharaoh 's officer that be with he in the ward of he lord 's house , say , wherefore look ye so sadly to day ?
and they say unto he , we have dream a dream , and there be no interpreter of it .
and joseph say unto they , do not interpretation belong to god ? tell i they , i pray you .
and the chief butler tell he dream to joseph , and say to he , in my dream , behold , a vine be before i ;
and in the vine be three branch : and it be as though it bud , and she blossom shoot forth ; and the cluster thereof bring forth ripe grape :
and pharaoh 's cup be in my hand : and i take the grape , and press they into pharaoh 's cup , and i give the cup into pharaoh 's hand .
and joseph say unto he , this be the interpretation of it : the three branch be three day :
yet within three day shall pharaoh lift up thine head , and restore thee unto thy place : and thou shalt deliver pharaoh 's cup into he hand , after the former manner when thou wast he butler .
but think on i when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , i pray thee , unto i , and make mention of i unto pharaoh , and bring i out of this house :
for indeed i be steal away out of the land of the hebrews : and here also have i do nothing that they should put i into the dungeon .
when the chief baker see that the interpretation be good , he say unto joseph , i also be in my dream , and , behold , i have three white basket on my head :
and in the uppermost basket there be of all manner of bakemeat for pharaoh ; and the bird do eat they out of the basket upon my head .
and joseph answer and say , this be the interpretation thereof : the three basket be three day :
yet within three day shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the bird shall eat thy flesh from off thee .
and it come to pass the third day , which be pharaoh 's birthday , that he make a feast unto all he servant : and he lift up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among he servant .
and he restore the chief butler unto he butlership again ; and he give the cup into pharaoh 's hand :
but he hang the chief baker : as joseph have interpret to they .
yet do not the chief butler remember joseph , but forgat he .
and it come to pass at the end of two full year , that pharaoh dream : and , behold , he stand by the river .
and , behold , there come up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatflesh ; and they feed in a meadow .
and , behold , seven other kine come up after they out of the river , ill favoured and leanflesh ; and stand by the other kine upon the brink of the river .
and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine do eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine .
so pharaoh awake .
and he sleep and dream the second time : and , behold , seven ear of corn come up upon one stalk , rank and good .
and , behold , seven thin ear and blast with the east wind spring up after they .
and the seven thin ear devour the seven rank and full ear .
and pharaoh awake , and , behold , it be a dream .
and it come to pass in the morning that he spirit be trouble ; and he send and call for all the magician of egypt , and all the wise man thereof : and pharaoh tell they he dream ; but there be none that could interpret they unto pharaoh .
then speak the chief butler unto pharaoh , say , i do remember my fault this day :
pharaoh be wroth with he servant , and put i in ward in the captain of the guard 's house , both i and the chief baker :
and we dream a dream in one night , i and he ; we dream each man accord to the interpretation of he dream .
and there be there with we a young man , a hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard ; and we tell he , and he interpret to we we dream ; to each man accord to he dream he do interpret .
and it come to pass , as he interpret to we , so it be ; i he restore unto mine office , and he he hang .
then pharaoh send and call joseph , and they bring he hastily out of the dungeon : and he shave himself , and change he raiment , and come in unto pharaoh .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , i have dream a dream , and there be none that can interpret it : and i have hear say of thee , that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it .
and joseph answer pharaoh , say , it be not in i : god shall give pharaoh a answer of peace .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , in my dream , behold , i stand upon the bank of the river :
and , behold , there come up out of the river seven kine , fatfleshed and well favour ; and they feed in a meadow :
and , behold , seven other kine come up after they , poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed , such as i never see in all the land of egypt for badness :
and the lean and the ill favoured kine do eat up the first seven fat kine :
and when they have eat they up , it could not be know that they have eat they ; but they be still ill favoured , as at the beginning .
so i awake .
and i see in my dream , and , behold , seven ear come up in one stalk , full and good :
and , behold , seven ear , wither , thin , and blast with the east wind , spring up after they :
and the thin ear devour the seven good ear : and i tell this unto the magician ; but there be none that could declare it to i .
and joseph say unto pharaoh , the dream of pharaoh be one : god have shewed pharaoh what he be about to do .
the seven good kine be seven year ; and the seven good ear be seven year : the dream be one .
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that come up after they be seven year ; and the seven empty ear blast with the east wind shall be seven year of famine .
this be the thing which i have speak unto pharaoh : what god be about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh .
behold , there come seven year of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt :
and there shall arise after they seven year of famine ; and all the plenty shall be forget in the land of egypt ; and the famine shall consume the land ;
and the plenty shall not be know in the land by reason of that famine follow ; for it shall be very grievous .
and for that the dream be double unto pharaoh twice ; it be because the thing be establish by god , and god will shortly bring it to pass .
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise , and set he over the land of egypt .
let pharaoh do this , and let he appoint officer over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous year .
and let they gather all the food of those good year that come , and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh , and let they keep food in the city .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven year of famine , which shall be in the land of egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
and the thing be good in the eye of pharaoh , and in the eye of all he servant .
and pharaoh say unto he servant , can we find such a one as this be , a man in whom the spirit of god be ?
and pharaoh say unto joseph , forasmuch as god have shewed thee all this , there be none so discreet and wise as thou art :
thou shalt be over my house , and accord unto thy word shall all my people be rule : only in the throne will i be greater than thou .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , see , i have set thee over all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh take off he ring from he hand , and put it upon joseph 's hand , and array he in vesture of fine linen , and put a gold chain about he neck ;
and he make he to ride in the second chariot which he have ; and they cry before he , bow the knee : and he make he ruler over all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , i be pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift up he hand or foot in all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh call joseph 's name zaphnathpaaneah ; and he give he to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on .
and joseph go out over all the land of egypt .
and joseph be thirty year old when he stand before pharaoh king of egypt .
and joseph go out from the presence of pharaoh , and go throughout all the land of egypt .
and in the seven plenteous year the earth bring forth by handful .
and he gather up all the food of the seven year , which be in the land of egypt , and lay up the food in the city : the food of the field , which be round about every city , lay he up in the same .
and joseph gather corn as the sand of the sea , very much , until he leave numbering ; for it be without number .
and unto joseph be bear two son before the year of famine come , which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto he .
and joseph call the name of the firstborn manasseh : for god , say he , have make i forget all my toil , and all my father 's house .
and the name of the second call he ephraim : for god have cause i to be fruitful in the land of my affliction .
and the seven year of plenteousness , that be in the land of egypt , be end .
and the seven year of dearth begin to come , accord as joseph have say : and the dearth be in all land ; but in all the land of egypt there be bread .
and when all the land of egypt be famish , the people cry to pharaoh for bread : and pharaoh say unto all the egyptians , go unto joseph ; what he saith to you , do .
and the famine be over all the face of the earth : and joseph open all the storehouse , and sell unto the egyptians ; and the famine wax sore in the land of egypt .
and all country come into egypt to joseph for to buy corn ; because that the famine be so sore in all land .
now when jacob see that there be corn in egypt , jacob say unto he son , why do ye look one upon another ?
and he say , behold , i have hear that there be corn in egypt : get you down thither , and buy for we from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
and joseph 's ten brethren go down to buy corn in egypt .
but benjamin , joseph 's brother , jacob send not with he brethren ; for he say , lest peradventure mischief befall he .
and the son of israel come to buy corn among those that come : for the famine be in the land of canaan .
and joseph be the governor over the land , and he it be that sell to all the people of the land : and joseph 's brethren come , and bow down themselves before he with they face to the earth .
and joseph see he brethren , and he know they , but make himself strange unto they , and spake roughly unto they ; and he say unto they , whence come ye ?
and they say , from the land of canaan to buy food .
and joseph know he brethren , but they know not he .
and joseph remember the dream which he dream of they , and say unto they , ye be spy ; to see the nakedness of the land ye be come .
and they say unto he , nay , my lord , but to buy food be thy servant come .
we be all one man 's son ; we be true man , thy servant be no spy .
and he say unto they , nay , but to see the nakedness of the land ye be come .
and they say , thy servant be twelve brethren , the son of one man in the land of canaan ; and , behold , the youngest be this day with we father , and one be not .
and joseph say unto they , that be it that i speak unto you , say , ye be spy :
hereby ye shall be prove : by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence , except you youngest brother come hither .
send one of you , and let he fetch you brother , and ye shall be keep in prison , that you word may be prove , whether there be any truth in you : or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye be spy .
and he put they all together into ward three day .
and joseph say unto they the third day , this do , and live ; for i fear god :
if ye be true man , let one of you brethren be bind in the house of you prison : go ye , carry corn for the famine of you house :
but bring you youngest brother unto i ; so shall you word be verify , and ye shall not die .
and they do so .
and they say one to another , we be verily guilty concern we brother , in that we see the anguish of he soul , when he beseech we , and we would not hear ; therefore be this distress come upon we .
and reuben answer they , say , spake i not unto you , say , do not sin against the child ; and ye would not hear ? therefore , behold , also he blood be require .
and they know not that joseph understand they ; for he speak unto they by a interpreter .
and he turn himself about from they , and weep ; and return to they again , and commune with they , and take from they simeon , and bind he before they eye .
then joseph command to fill they sack with corn , and to restore every man 's money into he sack , and to give they provision for the way : and thus do he unto they .
and they lade they ass with the corn , and depart thence .
and as one of they open he sack to give he ass provender in the inn , he espy he money ; for , behold , it be in he sack 's mouth .
and he say unto he brethren , my money be restore ; and , lo , it be even in my sack : and they heart fail they , and they be afraid , say one to another , what be this that god have do unto we ?
and they come unto jacob they father unto the land of canaan , and tell he all that befall unto they ; say ,
the man , who be the lord of the land , spake roughly to we , and take we for spy of the country .
and we say unto he , we be true man ; we be no spy :
we be twelve brethren , son of we father ; one be not , and the youngest be this day with we father in the land of canaan .
and the man , the lord of the country , say unto we , hereby shall i know that ye be true man ; leave one of you brethren here with i , and take food for the famine of you household , and be go :
and bring you youngest brother unto i : then shall i know that ye be no spy , but that ye be true man : so will i deliver you you brother , and ye shall traffick in the land .
and it come to pass as they empty they sack , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money be in he sack : and when both they and they father see the bundle of money , they be afraid .
and jacob they father say unto they , i have ye bereaved of my child : joseph be not , and simeon be not , and ye will take benjamin away : all these thing be against i .
and reuben spake unto he father , say , slay my two son , if i bring he not to thee : deliver he into my hand , and i will bring he to thee again .
and he say , my son shall not go down with you ; for he brother be dead , and he be leave alone : if mischief befall he by the way in the which ye go , then shall ye bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave .
and the famine be sore in the land .
and it come to pass , when they have eat up the corn which they have bring out of egypt , they father say unto they , go again , buy we a little food .
and judah spake unto he , say , the man do solemnly protest unto we , say , ye shall not see my face , except you brother be with you .
if thou wilt send we brother with we , we will go down and buy thee food :
but if thou wilt not send he , we will not go down : for the man say unto we , ye shall not see my face , except you brother be with you .
and israel say , wherefore deal ye so ill with i , as to tell the man whether ye have yet a brother ?
and they say , the man ask we straitly of we state , and of we kindred , say , be you father yet alive ? have ye another brother ? and we tell he accord to the tenor of these word : could we certainly know that he would say , bring you brother down ?
and judah say unto israel he father , send the lad with i , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and thou , and also we little one .
i will be surety for he ; of my hand shalt thou require he : if i bring he not unto thee , and set he before thee , then let i bear the blame for ever :
for except we have linger , surely now we have return this second time .
and they father israel say unto they , if it must be so now , do this ; take of the best fruit in the land in you vessel , and carry down the man a present , a little balm , and a little honey , spice , and myrrh , nut , and almond :
and take double money in you hand ; and the money that be bring again in the mouth of you sack , carry it again in you hand ; peradventure it be a oversight :
take also you brother , and arise , go again unto the man :
and god almighty give you mercy before the man , that he may send away you other brother , and benjamin .
if i be bereave of my child , i be bereaved .
and the man take that present , and they take double money in they hand , and benjamin ; and rise up , and go down to egypt , and stand before joseph .
and when joseph see benjamin with they , he say to the ruler of he house , bring these man home , and slay , and make ready ; for these man shall dine with i at noon .
and the man do as joseph bid ; and the man bring the man into joseph 's house .
and the man be afraid , because they be bring into joseph 's house ; and they say , because of the money that be return in we sack at the first time be we bring in ; that he may seek occasion against we , and fall upon we , and take we for bondman , and we ass .
and they come near to the steward of joseph 's house , and they commune with he at the door of the house ,
and say , o sir , we come indeed down at the first time to buy food :
and it come to pass , when we come to the inn , that we open we sack , and , behold , every man 's money be in the mouth of he sack , we money in full weight : and we have bring it again in we hand .
and other money have we bring down in we hand to buy food : we can not tell who put we money in we sack .
and he say , peace be to you , fear not : you god , and the god of you father , have give you treasure in you sack : i have you money .
and he bring simeon out unto they .
and the man bring the man into joseph 's house , and give they water , and they wash they foot ; and he give they ass provender .
and they make ready the present against joseph come at noon : for they hear that they should eat bread there .
and when joseph come home , they bring he the present which be in they hand into the house , and bow themselves to he to the earth .
and he ask they of they welfare , and say , be you father well , the old man of whom ye spake ?
be he yet alive ?
and they answer , thy servant we father be in good health , he be yet alive .
and they bow down they head , and make obeisance .
and he lift up he eye , and see he brother benjamin , he mother 's son , and say , be this you younger brother , of whom ye spake unto i ?
and he say , god be gracious unto thee , my son .
and joseph make haste ; for he bowels do yearn upon he brother : and he seek where to weep ; and he enter into he chamber , and weep there .
and he wash he face , and go out , and refrain himself , and say , set on bread .
and they set on for he by himself , and for they by themselves , and for the egyptians , which do eat with he , by themselves : because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews ; for that be a abomination unto the egyptians .
and they sit before he , the firstborn accord to he birthright , and the youngest accord to he youth : and the man marvel one at another .
and he take and send mess unto they from before he : but benjamin 's mess be five time so much as any of theirs .
and they drink , and be merry with he .
and he command the steward of he house , say , fill the man 's sack with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man 's money in he sack 's mouth .
and put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack 's mouth of the youngest , and he corn money .
and he do accord to the word that joseph have speak .
as soon as the morning be light , the man be send away , they and they ass .
and when they be go out of the city , and not yet far off , joseph say unto he steward , up , follow after the man ; and when thou dost overtake they , say unto they , wherefore have ye reward evil for good ?
be not this it in which my lord drinketh , and whereby indeed he divineth ? ye have do evil in so do .
and he overtake they , and he speak unto they these same word .
and they say unto he , wherefore saith my lord these word ?
god forbid that thy servant should do accord to this thing :
behold , the money , which we find in we sack ' mouth , we bring again unto thee out of the land of canaan : how then should we steal out of thy lord 's house silver or gold ?
with whomsoever of thy servant it be find , both let he die , and we also will be my lord 's bondman .
and he say , now also let it be accord unto you word : he with whom it be find shall be my servant ; and ye shall be blameless .
then they speedily take down every man he sack to the ground , and open every man he sack .
and he search , and begin at the eldest , and leave at the youngest : and the cup be find in benjamin 's sack .
then they rent they clothes , and laded every man he ass , and return to the city .
and judah and he brethren come to joseph 's house ; for he be yet there : and they fall before he on the ground .
and joseph say unto they , what deed be this that ye have do ? wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine ?
and judah say , what shall we say unto my lord ? what shall we speak ? or how shall we clear ourselves ?
god have find out the iniquity of thy servant : behold , we be my lord 's servant , both we , and he also with whom the cup be find .
and he say , god forbid that i should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup be find , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto you father .
then judah come near unto he , and say , oh my lord , let thy servant , i pray thee , speak a word in my lord 's ear , and let not thine anger burn against thy servant : for thou art even as pharaoh .
my lord ask he servant , say , have ye a father , or a brother ?
and we say unto my lord , we have a father , a old man , and a child of he old age , a little one ; and he brother be dead , and he alone be leave of he mother , and he father loveth he .
and thou saidst unto thy servant , bring he down unto i , that i may set mine eye upon he .
and we say unto my lord , the lad can not leave he father : for if he should leave he father , he father would die .
and thou saidst unto thy servant , except you youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more .
and it come to pass when we come up unto thy servant my father , we tell he the word of my lord .
and we father say , go again , and buy we a little food .
and we say , we can not go down : if we youngest brother be with we , then will we go down : for we may not see the man 's face , except we youngest brother be with we .
and thy servant my father say unto we , ye know that my wife bare i two son :
and the one go out from i , and i say , surely he be tear in piece ; and i see he not since :
and if ye take this also from i , and mischief befall he , ye shall bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave .
now therefore when i come to thy servant my father , and the lad be not with we ; see that he life be bind up in the lad 's life ;
it shall come to pass , when he seeth that the lad be not with we , that he will die : and thy servant shall bring down the gray hair of thy servant we father with sorrow to the grave .
for thy servant become surety for the lad unto my father , say , if i bring he not unto thee , then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever .
now therefore , i pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with he brethren .
for how shall i go up to my father , and the lad be not with i ? lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father .
then joseph could not refrain himself before all they that stand by he ; and he cry , cause every man to go out from i .
and there stand no man with he , while joseph make himself known unto he brethren .
and he weep aloud : and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh hear .
and joseph say unto he brethren , i be joseph ; doth my father yet live ?
and he brethren could not answer he ; for they be trouble at he presence .
and joseph say unto he brethren , come near to i , i pray you .
and they come near .
and he say , i be joseph you brother , whom ye sell into egypt .
now therefore be not grieve , nor angry with yourselve , that ye sell i hither : for god do send i before you to preserve life .
for these two year have the famine be in the land : and yet there be five year , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
and god send i before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth , and to save you life by a great deliverance .
so now it be not you that send i hither , but god : and he have make i a father to pharaoh , and lord of all he house , and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt .
haste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto he , thus saith thy son joseph , god have make i lord of all egypt : come down unto i , tarry not :
and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen , and thou shalt be near unto i , thou , and thy child , and thy child 's child , and thy flock , and thy herd , and all that thou hast :
and there will i nourish thee ; for yet there be five year of famine ; lest thou , and thy household , and all that thou hast , come to poverty .
and , behold , you eye see , and the eye of my brother benjamin , that it be my mouth that speaketh unto you .
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt , and of all that ye have see ; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither .
and he fall upon he brother benjamin 's neck , and weep ; and benjamin weep upon he neck .
moreover he kiss all he brethren , and weep upon they : and after that he brethren talk with he .
and the fame thereof be hear in pharaoh 's house , say , joseph 's brethren be come : and it pleased pharaoh well , and he servant .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , say unto thy brethren , this do ye ; lade you beast , and go , get you unto the land of canaan ;
and take you father and you household , and come unto i : and i will give you the good of the land of egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
now thou art command , this do ye ; take you wagon out of the land of egypt for you little one , and for you wife , and bring you father , and come .
also regard not you stuff ; for the good of all the land of egypt be yours .
and the child of israel do so : and joseph give they wagon , accord to the commandment of pharaoh , and give they provision for the way .
to all of they he give each man change of raiment ; but to benjamin he give three hundred piece of silver , and five change of raiment .
and to he father he send after this manner ; ten ass laden with the good thing of egypt , and ten she ass laden with corn and bread and meat for he father by the way .
so he send he brethren away , and they depart : and he say unto they , see that ye fall not out by the way .
and they go up out of egypt , and come into the land of canaan unto jacob they father ,
and tell he , say , joseph be yet alive , and he be governor over all the land of egypt .
and jacob 's heart faint , for he believe they not .
and they tell he all the word of joseph , which he have say unto they : and when he see the wagon which joseph have send to carry he , the spirit of jacob they father revive :
and israel say , it be enough ; joseph my son be yet alive : i will go and see he before i die .
and israel take he journey with all that he have , and come to beersheba , and offer sacrifice unto the god of he father isaac .
and god speak unto israel in the vision of the night , and say , jacob , jacob .
and he say , here be i.
and he say , i be god , the god of thy father : fear not to go down into egypt ; for i will there make of thee a great nation :
i will go down with thee into egypt ; and i will also surely bring thee up again : and joseph shall put he hand upon thine eye .
and jacob rise up from beersheba : and the son of israel carry jacob they father , and they little one , and they wife , in the wagon which pharaoh have send to carry he .
and they take they cattle , and they goods , which they have get in the land of canaan , and come into egypt , jacob , and all he seed with he :
he son , and he son ' son with he , he daughter , and he son ' daughter , and all he seed bring he with he into egypt .
and these be the name of the child of israel , which come into egypt , jacob and he son : reuben , jacob 's firstborn .

and the son of issachar ; tola , and phuvah , and job , and shimron .
and the son of zebulun ; sered , and elon , and jahleel .
these be the son of leah , which she bare unto jacob in padanaram , with he daughter dinah : all the soul of he son and he daughter be thirty and three .
and the son of gad ; ziphion , and haggi , shuni , and ezbon , eri , and arodi , and areli .
and the son of asher ; jimnah , and ishuah , and isui , and beriah , and serah they sister : and the son of beriah ; heber , and malchiel .
these be the son of zilpah , whom laban give to leah he daughter , and these she bare unto jacob , even sixteen soul .

and the son of joseph , which be bear he in egypt , be two soul : all the soul of the house of jacob , which come into egypt , be threescore and ten .
and he send judah before he unto joseph , to direct he face unto goshen ; and they come into the land of goshen .
and joseph make ready he chariot , and go up to meet israel he father , to goshen , and present himself unto he ; and he fall on he neck , and weep on he neck a good while .
and israel say unto joseph , now let i die , since i have see thy face , because thou art yet alive .
and joseph say unto he brethren , and unto he father 's house , i will go up , and shew pharaoh , and say unto he , my brethren , and my father 's house , which be in the land of canaan , be come unto i ;
and the man be shepherd , for they trade have be to feed cattle ; and they have bring they flock , and they herd , and all that they have .
and it shall come to pass , when pharaoh shall call you , and shall say , what be you occupation ?
that ye shall say , thy servant ' trade have be about cattle from we youth even until now , both we , and also we father : that ye may dwell in the land of goshen ; for every shepherd be a abomination unto the egyptians .
then joseph come and tell pharaoh , and say , my father and my brethren , and they flock , and they herd , and all that they have , be come out of the land of canaan ; and , behold , they be in the land of goshen .
and he take some of he brethren , even five man , and present they unto pharaoh .
and pharaoh say unto he brethren , what be you occupation ?
and they say unto pharaoh , thy servant be shepherd , both we , and also we father .
they say moreover unto pharaoh , for to sojourn in the land be we come ; for thy servant have no pasture for they flock ; for the famine be sore in the land of canaan : now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servant dwell in the land of goshen .
and pharaoh speak unto joseph , say , thy father and thy brethren be come unto thee :
the land of egypt be before thee ; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell ; in the land of goshen let they dwell : and if thou knowest any man of activity among they , then make they ruler over my cattle .
and joseph bring in jacob he father , and set he before pharaoh : and jacob bless pharaoh .
and pharaoh say unto jacob , how old art thou ?
and jacob say unto pharaoh , the day of the year of my pilgrimage be a hundred and thirty year : few and evil have the day of the year of my life be , and have not attain unto the day of the year of the life of my father in the day of they pilgrimage .
and jacob bless pharaoh , and go out from before pharaoh .
and joseph place he father and he brethren , and give they a possession in the land of egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of rameses , as pharaoh have command .
and joseph nourish he father , and he brethren , and all he father 's household , with bread , accord to they family .
and there be no bread in all the land ; for the famine be very sore , so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan faint by reason of the famine .
and joseph gather up all the money that be find in the land of egypt , and in the land of canaan , for the corn which they buy : and joseph bring the money into pharaoh 's house .
and when money fail in the land of egypt , and in the land of canaan , all the egyptians come unto joseph , and say , give we bread : for why should we die in thy presence ? for the money faileth .
and joseph say , give you cattle ; and i will give you for you cattle , if money fail .
and they bring they cattle unto joseph : and joseph give they bread in exchange for horse , and for the flock , and for the cattle of the herd , and for the ass : and he feed they with bread for all they cattle for that year .
when that year be end , they come unto he the second year , and say unto he , we will not hide it from my lord , how that we money be spend ; my lord also have we herd of cattle ; there be not ought left in the sight of my lord , but we body , and we land :
wherefore shall we die before thine eye , both we and we land ? buy we and we land for bread , and we and we land will be servant unto pharaoh : and give we seed , that we may live , and not die , that the land be not desolate .
and joseph buy all the land of egypt for pharaoh ; for the egyptians sell every man he field , because the famine prevail over they : so the land become pharaoh 's .
and as for the people , he remove they to city from one end of the border of egypt even to the other end thereof .
only the land of the priest buy he not ; for the priest have a portion assign they of pharaoh , and do eat they portion which pharaoh give they : wherefore they sell not they land .
then joseph say unto the people , behold , i have buy you this day and you land for pharaoh : lo , here be seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
and it shall come to pass in the increase , that ye shall give the fifth part unto pharaoh , and four part shall be you own , for seed of the field , and for you food , and for they of you household , and for food for you little one .
and they say , thou hast save we life : let we find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be pharaoh 's servant .
and joseph make it a law over the land of egypt unto this day , that pharaoh should have the fifth part ; except the land of the priest only , which become not pharaoh 's .
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt , in the country of goshen ; and they have possession therein , and grow , and multiply exceedingly .
and jacob live in the land of egypt seventeen year : so the whole age of jacob be a hundred forty and seven year .
and the time draw nigh that israel must die : and he call he son joseph , and say unto he , if now i have find grace in thy sight , put , i pray thee , thy hand under my thigh , and deal kindly and truly with i ; bury i not , i pray thee , in egypt :
but i will lie with my father , and thou shalt carry i out of egypt , and bury i in they buryingplace .
and he say , i will do as thou hast say .
and he say , swear unto i .
and he sware unto he .
and israel bow himself upon the bed 's head .
and it come to pass after these thing , that one tell joseph , behold , thy father be sick : and he take with he he two son , manasseh and ephraim .
and one tell jacob , and say , behold , thy son joseph cometh unto thee : and israel strengthen himself , and sit upon the bed .
and jacob say unto joseph , god almighty appear unto i at luz in the land of canaan , and bless i ,
and say unto i , behold , i will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and i will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for a everlasting possession .
and now thy two son , ephraim and manasseh , which be bear unto thee in the land of egypt before i come unto thee into egypt , be mine ; as reuben and simeon , they shall be mine .
and thy issue , which thou begettest after they , shall be thine , and shall be call after the name of they brethren in they inheritance .
and as for i , when i come from padan , rachel die by i in the land of canaan in the way , when yet there be but a little way to come unto ephrath : and i bury she there in the way of ephrath ; the same be bethlehem .
and israel behold joseph 's son , and say , who be these ?
and joseph say unto he father , they be my son , whom god have give i in this place .
and he say , bring they , i pray thee , unto i , and i will bless they .
now the eye of israel be dim for age , so that he could not see .
and he bring they near unto he ; and he kiss they , and embrace they .
and israel say unto joseph , i have not think to see thy face : and , lo , god have shew i also thy seed .
and joseph bring they out from between he knee , and he bow himself with he face to the earth .
and joseph take they both , ephraim in he right hand toward israel 's left hand , and manasseh in he left hand toward israel 's right hand , and bring they near unto he .
and israel stretch out he right hand , and lay it upon ephraim 's head , who be the younger , and he left hand upon manasseh 's head , guide he hand wittingly ; for manasseh be the firstborn .
and he bless joseph , and say , god , before whom my father abraham and isaac do walk , the god which feed i all my life long unto this day ,
the angel which redeem i from all evil , bless the lad ; and let my name be name on they , and the name of my father abraham and isaac ; and let they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
and when joseph see that he father lay he right hand upon the head of ephraim , it displeased he : and he hold up he father 's hand , to remove it from ephraim 's head unto manasseh 's head .
and joseph say unto he father , not so , my father : for this be the firstborn ; put thy right hand upon he head .
and he father refuse , and say , i know it , my son , i know it : he also shall become a people , and he also shall be great : but truly he younger brother shall be greater than he , and he seed shall become a multitude of nation .
and he bless they that day , say , in thee shall israel bless , say , god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh : and he set ephraim before manasseh .
and israel say unto joseph , behold , i die : but god shall be with you , and bring you again unto the land of you father .
moreover i have give to thee one portion above thy brethren , which i take out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow .
and jacob call unto he son , and say , gather yourselve together , that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last day .
gather yourselve together , and hear , ye son of jacob ; and hearken unto israel you father .
reuben , thou art my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity , and the excellency of power :
unstable as water , thou shalt not excel ; because thou wentest up to thy father 's bed ; then defiledst thou it : he go up to my couch .
simeon and levi be brethren ; instrument of cruelty be in they habitation .
o my soul , come not thou into they secret ; unto they assembly , mine honour , be not thou unite : for in they anger they slew a man , and in they selfwill they dig down a wall .
curse be they anger , for it be fierce ; and they wrath , for it be cruel : i will divide they in jacob , and scatter they in israel .
judah , thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise : thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemy ; thy father 's child shall bow down before thee .
judah be a lion 's whelp : from the prey , my son , thou art go up : he stoop down , he couch as a lion , and as a old lion ; who shall rouse he up ?
the sceptre shall not depart from judah , nor a lawgiver from between he foot , until shiloh come ; and unto he shall the gathering of the people be .
bind he foal unto the vine , and he ass 's colt unto the choice vine ; he wash he garment in wine , and he clothes in the blood of grape :
he eye shall be red with wine , and he tooth white with milk .
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ; and he shall be for a haven of ship ; and he border shall be unto zidon .
issachar be a strong ass couch down between two burden :
and he see that rest be good , and the land that it be pleasant ; and bow he shoulder to bear , and become a servant unto tribute .
dan shall judge he people , as one of the tribe of israel .
dan shall be a serpent by the way , a adder in the path , that biteth the horse heel , so that he rider shall fall backward .
i have wait for thy salvation , o lord .
gad , a troop shall overcome he : but he shall overcome at the last .
out of asher he bread shall be fat , and he shall yield royal dainty .
naphtali be a hind let loose : he giveth goodly word .
joseph be a fruitful bough , even a fruitful bough by a well ; whose branch run over the wall :
the archer have sorely grieve he , and shot at he , and hate he :
but he bow abode in strength , and the arm of he hand be make strong by the hand of the mighty god of jacob ; ( from thence be the shepherd , the stone of israel : )
even by the god of thy father , who shall help thee ; and by the almighty , who shall bless thee with blessing of heaven above , blessing of the deep that lieth under , blessing of the breast , and of the womb :
the blessing of thy father have prevail above the blessing of my progenitor unto the utmost bind of the everlasting hill : they shall be on the head of joseph , and on the crown of the head of he that be separate from he brethren .
benjamin shall ravin as a wolf : in the morning he shall devour the prey , and at night he shall divide the spoil .
all these be the twelve tribe of israel : and this be it that they father spake unto they , and bless they ; every one accord to he blessing he bless they .
and he charge they , and say unto they , i be to be gather unto my people : bury i with my father in the cave that be in the field of ephron the hittite ,
in the cave that be in the field of machpelah , which be before mamre , in the land of canaan , which abraham buy with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace .
there they bury abraham and sarah he wife ; there they bury isaac and rebekah he wife ; and there i bury leah .
the purchase of the field and of the cave that be therein be from the child of heth .
and when jacob have make a end of command he son , he gather up he foot into the bed , and yield up the ghost , and be gather unto he people .
and joseph fall upon he father 's face , and weep upon he , and kiss he .
and joseph command he servant the physician to embalm he father : and the physician embalm israel .
and forty day be fulfil for he ; for so be fulfil the day of those which be embalm : and the egyptians mourn for he threescore and ten day .
and when the day of he mourning be past , joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh , say , if now i have find grace in you eye , speak , i pray you , in the ear of pharaoh , say ,
my father make i swear , say , lo , i die : in my grave which i have dig for i in the land of canaan , there shalt thou bury i .
now therefore let i go up , i pray thee , and bury my father , and i will come again .
and pharaoh say , go up , and bury thy father , accord as he make thee swear .
and joseph go up to bury he father : and with he go up all the servant of pharaoh , the elder of he house , and all the elder of the land of egypt ,
and all the house of joseph , and he brethren , and he father 's house : only they little one , and they flock , and they herd , they leave in the land of goshen .
and there go up with he both chariot and horseman : and it be a very great company .
and they come to the threshingfloor of atad , which be beyond jordan , and there they mourn with a great and very sore lamentation : and he make a mourning for he father seven day .
and when the inhabitant of the land , the canaanites , see the mourning in the floor of atad , they say , this be a grievous mourning to the egyptians : wherefore the name of it be call abelmizraim , which be beyond jordan .
and he son do unto he accord as he command they :
for he son carry he into the land of canaan , and bury he in the cave of the field of machpelah , which abraham buy with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite , before mamre .
and joseph return into egypt , he , and he brethren , and all that go up with he to bury he father , after he have bury he father .
and when joseph 's brethren see that they father be dead , they say , joseph will peradventure hate we , and will certainly requite we all the evil which we do unto he .
and they send a messenger unto joseph , say , thy father do command before he die , say ,
so shall ye say unto joseph , forgive , i pray thee now , the trespass of thy brethren , and they sin ; for they do unto thee evil : and now , we pray thee , forgive the trespass of the servant of the god of thy father .
and joseph weep when they speak unto he .
and he brethren also go and fall down before he face ; and they say , behold , we be thy servant .
and joseph say unto they , fear not : for be i in the place of god ?
but as for you , ye think evil against i ; but god mean it unto good , to bring to pass , as it be this day , to save much people alive .
now therefore fear ye not : i will nourish you , and you little one .
and he comfort they , and spake kindly unto they .
and joseph dwelt in egypt , he , and he father 's house : and joseph live a hundred and ten year .
and joseph see ephraim 's child of the third generation : the child also of machir the son of manasseh be bring up upon joseph 's knee .
and joseph say unto he brethren , i die : and god will surely visit you , and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob .
and joseph take a oath of the child of israel , say , god will surely visit you , and ye shall carry up my bone from hence .
so joseph die , be a hundred and ten year old : and they embalm he , and he be put in a coffin in egypt .
now these be the name of the child of israel , which come into egypt ; every man and he household come with jacob .
reuben , simeon , levi , and judah ,
issachar , zebulun , and benjamin ,
dan , and naphtali , gad , and asher .
and all the soul that come out of the loin of jacob be seventy soul : for joseph be in egypt already .
and joseph die , and all he brethren , and all that generation .
and the child of israel be fruitful , and increase abundantly , and multiply , and wax exceed mighty ; and the land be fill with they .
now there arise up a new king over egypt , which know not joseph .
and he say unto he people , behold , the people of the child of israel be more and mightier than we :
come on , let we deal wisely with they ; lest they multiply , and it come to pass , that , when there falleth out any war , they join also unto we enemy , and fight against we , and so get they up out of the land .
therefore they do set over they taskmaster to afflict they with they burden .
and they build for pharaoh treasure city , pithom and raamses .
but the more they afflict they , the more they multiply and grow .
and they be grieve because of the child of israel .
and the egyptians make the child of israel to serve with rigour :
and they make they life bitter with hard bondage , in morter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all they service , wherein they make they serve , be with rigour .
and the king of egypt speak to the hebrew midwife , of which the name of the one be shiphrah , and the name of the other puah :
and he say , when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew woman , and see they upon the stool ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill he : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
but the midwife fear god , and do not as the king of egypt command they , but save the man child alive .
and the king of egypt call for the midwife , and say unto they , why have ye do this thing , and have save the man child alive ?
and the midwife say unto pharaoh , because the hebrew woman be not as the egyptian woman ; for they be lively , and be deliver ere the midwife come in unto they .
therefore god deal well with the midwife : and the people multiply , and wax very mighty .
and it come to pass , because the midwife fear god , that he make they house .
and pharaoh charge all he people , say , every son that be bear ye shall cast into the river , and every daughter ye shall save alive .
and there go a man of the house of levi , and take to wife a daughter of levi .
and the woman conceive , and bare a son : and when she see he that he be a goodly child , she hide he three month .
and when she could not longer hide he , she take for he a ark of bulrush , and daub it with slime and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she lay it in the flag by the river 's brink .
and he sister stand afar off , to wit what would be do to he .
and the daughter of pharaoh come down to wash herself at the river ; and she maiden walk along by the river 's side ; and when she see the ark among the flag , she send she maid to fetch it .
and when she have open it , she see the child : and , behold , the babe weep .
and she have compassion on he , and say , this be one of the hebrews ' child .
then say he sister to pharaoh 's daughter , shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew woman , that she may nurse the child for thee ?
and pharaoh 's daughter say to she , go .
and the maid go and call the child 's mother .
and pharaoh 's daughter say unto she , take this child away , and nurse it for i , and i will give thee thy wages .
and the woman take the child , and nurse it .
and the child grow , and she bring he unto pharaoh 's daughter , and he become she son .
and she call he name mose : and she say , because i draw he out of the water .
and it come to pass in those day , when moses be grow , that he go out unto he brethren , and look on they burden : and he spy a egyptian smite a hebrew , one of he brethren .
and he look this way and that way , and when he see that there be no man , he slew the egyptian , and hide he in the sand .
and when he go out the second day , behold , two man of the hebrews strive together : and he say to he that do the wrong , wherefore smitest thou thy fellow ?
and he say , who make thee a prince and a judge over we ? intendest thou to kill i , as thou killedst the egyptian ?
and moses fear , and say , surely this thing be know .
now when pharaoh hear this thing , he seek to slay moses .
but moses flee from the face of pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of midian : and he sit down by a well .
now the priest of midian have seven daughter : and they come and draw water , and fill the trough to water they father 's flock .
and the shepherd come and drive they away : but moses stand up and help they , and water they flock .
and when they come to reuel they father , he say , how be it that ye be come so soon to day ?
and they say , a egyptian deliver we out of the hand of the shepherd , and also draw water enough for we , and water the flock .
and he say unto he daughter , and where be he ? why be it that ye have leave the man ? call he , that he may eat bread .
and moses be content to dwell with the man : and he give moses zipporah he daughter .
and she bare he a son , and he call he name gershom : for he say , i have be a stranger in a strange land .
and it come to pass in process of time , that the king of egypt die : and the child of israel sigh by reason of the bondage , and they cry , and they cry come up unto god by reason of the bondage .
and god hear they groaning , and god remember he covenant with abraham , with isaac , and with jacob .
and god look upon the child of israel , and god have respect unto they .
now mose keep the flock of jethro he father in law , the priest of midian : and he lead the flock to the backside of the desert , and come to the mountain of god , even to horeb .
and the angel of the lord appear unto he in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he look , and , behold , the bush burn with fire , and the bush be not consume .
and moses say , i will now turn aside , and see this great sight , why the bush be not burnt .
and when the lord see that he turn aside to see , god call unto he out of the midst of the bush , and say , moses , moses .
and he say , here be i.
and he say , draw not nigh hither : put off thy shoe from off thy foot , for the place whereon thou standest be holy ground .
moreover he say , i be the god of thy father , the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob .
and moses hide he face ; for he be afraid to look upon god .
and the lord say , i have surely see the affliction of my people which be in egypt , and have hear they cry by reason of they taskmaster ; for i know they sorrow ;
and i be come down to deliver they out of the hand of the egyptians , and to bring they up out of that land unto a good land and a large , unto a land flow with milk and honey ; unto the place of the canaanites , and the hittites , and the amorites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites .
now therefore , behold , the cry of the child of israel be come unto i : and i have also see the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress they .
come now therefore , and i will send thee unto pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the child of israel out of egypt .
and moses say unto god , who be i , that i should go unto pharaoh , and that i should bring forth the child of israel out of egypt ?
and he say , certainly i will be with thee ; and this shall be a token unto thee , that i have send thee : when thou hast bring forth the people out of egypt , ye shall serve god upon this mountain .
and moses say unto god , behold , when i come unto the child of israel , and shall say unto they , the god of you father have send i unto you ; and they shall say to i , what be he name ? what shall i say unto they ?
and god say unto mose , i be that i be : and he say , thus shalt thou say unto the child of israel , i be have send i unto you .
and god say moreover unto mose , thus shalt thou say unto the child of israel , the lord god of you father , the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob , have send i unto you : this be my name for ever , and this be my memorial unto all generation .
go , and gather the elder of israel together , and say unto they , the lord god of you father , the god of abraham , of isaac , and of jacob , appear unto i , say , i have surely visit you , and see that which be do to you in egypt :
and i have say , i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites , and the hittites , and the amorites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , unto a land flow with milk and honey .
and they shall hearken to thy voice : and thou shalt come , thou and the elder of israel , unto the king of egypt , and ye shall say unto he , the lord god of the hebrews have meet with we : and now let we go , we beseech thee , three day ' journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to the lord we god .
and i be sure that the king of egypt will not let you go , no , not by a mighty hand .
and i will stretch out my hand , and smite egypt with all my wonder which i will do in the midst thereof : and after that he will let you go .
and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
but every woman shall borrow of she neighbour , and of she that sojourneth in she house , jewel of silver , and jewel of gold , and raiment : and ye shall put they upon you son , and upon you daughter ; and ye shall spoil the egyptians .
and mose answer and say , but , behold , they will not believe i , nor hearken unto my voice : for they will say , the lord have not appear unto thee .
and the lord say unto he , what be that in thine hand ?
and he say , a rod .
and he say , cast it on the ground .
and he cast it on the ground , and it become a serpent ; and moses flee from before it .
and the lord say unto moses , put forth thine hand , and take it by the tail .
and he put forth he hand , and catch it , and it become a rod in he hand :
that they may believe that the lord god of they father , the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob , have appear unto thee .
and the lord say furthermore unto he , put now thine hand into thy bosom .
and he put he hand into he bosom : and when he take it out , behold , he hand be leprous as snow .
and he say , put thine hand into thy bosom again .
and he put he hand into he bosom again ; and pluck it out of he bosom , and , behold , it be turn again as he other flesh .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two sign , neither hearken unto thy voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour it upon the dry land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land .
and moses say unto the lord , o my lord , i be not eloquent , neither heretofore , nor since thou hast speak unto thy servant : but i be slow of speech , and of a slow tongue .
and the lord say unto he , who have make man 's mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the see , or the blind ? have not i the lord ?
now therefore go , and i will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt say .
and he say , o my lord , send , i pray thee , by the hand of he whom thou wilt send .
and the anger of the lord be kindle against moses , and he say , be not aaron the levite thy brother ?
i know that he can speak well .
and also , behold , he cometh forth to meet thee : and when he seeth thee , he will be glad in he heart .
and thou shalt speak unto he , and put word in he mouth : and i will be with thy mouth , and with he mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to he instead of god .
and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand , wherewith thou shalt do sign .
and moses go and return to jethro he father in law , and say unto he , let i go , i pray thee , and return unto my brethren which be in egypt , and see whether they be yet alive .
and jethro say to moses , go in peace .
and the lord say unto mose in midian , go , return into egypt : for all the man be dead which seek thy life .
and moses take he wife and he son , and set they upon a ass , and he return to the land of egypt : and moses take the rod of god in he hand .
and the lord say unto mose , when thou goest to return into egypt , see that thou do all those wonder before pharaoh , which i have put in thine hand : but i will harden he heart , that he shall not let the people go .
and thou shalt say unto pharaoh , thus saith the lord , israel be my son , even my firstborn :
and i say unto thee , let my son go , that he may serve i : and if thou refuse to let he go , behold , i will slay thy son , even thy firstborn .
and it come to pass by the way in the inn , that the lord meet he , and seek to kill he .
then zipporah take a sharp stone , and cut off the foreskin of she son , and cast it at he foot , and say , surely a bloody husband art thou to i .
so he let he go : then she say , a bloody husband thou art , because of the circumcision .
and the lord say to aaron , go into the wilderness to meet moses .
and he go , and meet he in the mount of god , and kiss he .
and moses tell aaron all the word of the lord who have send he , and all the sign which he have command he .
and moses and aaron go and gather together all the elder of the child of israel :
and aaron speak all the word which the lord have speak unto mose , and do the sign in the sight of the people .
and the people believe : and when they hear that the lord have visit the child of israel , and that he have look upon they affliction , then they bow they head and worship .
and afterward moses and aaron go in , and tell pharaoh , thus saith the lord god of israel , let my people go , that they may hold a feast unto i in the wilderness .
and pharaoh say , who be the lord , that i should obey he voice to let israel go ?
i know not the lord , neither will i let israel go .
and they say , the god of the hebrews have meet with we : let we go , we pray thee , three day ' journey into the desert , and sacrifice unto the lord we god ; lest he fall upon we with pestilence , or with the sword .
and the king of egypt say unto they , wherefore do ye , moses and aaron , let the people from they work ? get you unto you burden .
and pharaoh say , behold , the people of the land now be many , and ye make they rest from they burden .
and pharaoh command the same day the taskmaster of the people , and they officer , say ,
ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as heretofore : let they go and gather straw for themselves .
and the tale of the brick , which they do make heretofore , ye shall lay upon they ; ye shall not diminish ought thereof : for they be idle ; therefore they cry , say , let we go and sacrifice to we god .
let there more work be lay upon the man , that they may labour therein ; and let they not regard vain word .
and the taskmaster of the people go out , and they officer , and they speak to the people , say , thus saith pharaoh , i will not give you straw .
go ye , get you straw where ye can find it : yet not ought of you work shall be diminish .
so the people be scatter abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble instead of straw .
and the taskmaster hast they , say , fulfil you work , you daily task , as when there be straw .
and the officer of the child of israel , which pharaoh 's taskmaster have set over they , be beat , and demand , wherefore have ye not fulfil you task in make brick both yesterday and to day , as heretofore ?
then the officer of the child of israel come and cry unto pharaoh , say , wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servant ?
there be no straw give unto thy servant , and they say to we , make brick : and , behold , thy servant be beat ; but the fault be in thine own people .
but he say , ye be idle , ye be idle : therefore ye say , let we go and do sacrifice to the lord .
go therefore now , and work ; for there shall no straw be give you , yet shall ye deliver the tale of brick .
and the officer of the child of israel do see that they be in evil case , after it be say , ye shall not minish ought from you brick of you daily task .
and they meet moses and aaron , who stand in the way , as they come forth from pharaoh :
and they say unto they , the lord look upon you , and judge ; because ye have make we savour to be abhor in the eye of pharaoh , and in the eye of he servant , to put a sword in they hand to slay we .
and moses return unto the lord , and say , lord , wherefore hast thou so evil entreat this people ? why be it that thou hast send i ?
for since i come to pharaoh to speak in thy name , he have do evil to this people ; neither hast thou deliver thy people at all .
then the lord say unto mose , now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh : for with a strong hand shall he let they go , and with a strong hand shall he drive they out of he land .
and god speak unto mose , and say unto he , i be the lord :
and i appear unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob , by the name of god almighty , but by my name jehovah be i not know to they .
and i have also establish my covenant with they , to give they the land of canaan , the land of they pilgrimage , wherein they be stranger .
and i have also hear the groaning of the child of israel , whom the egyptians keep in bondage ; and i have remember my covenant .
wherefore say unto the child of israel , i be the lord , and i will bring you out from under the burden of the egyptians , and i will rid you out of they bondage , and i will redeem you with a stretch out arm , and with great judgment :
and i will take you to i for a people , and i will be to you a god : and ye shall know that i be the lord you god , which bringeth you out from under the burden of the egyptians .
and i will bring you in unto the land , concern the which i do swear to give it to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob ; and i will give it you for a heritage : i be the lord .
and moses spake so unto the child of israel : but they hearken not unto mose for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
go in , speak unto pharaoh king of egypt , that he let the child of israel go out of he land .
and moses spake before the lord , say , behold , the child of israel have not hearken unto i ; how then shall pharaoh hear i , who be of uncircumcised lip ?
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , and give they a charge unto the child of israel , and unto pharaoh king of egypt , to bring the child of israel out of the land of egypt .

and it come to pass on the day when the lord speak unto mose in the land of egypt ,
that the lord speak unto mose , say , i be the lord : speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto thee .
and moses say before the lord , behold , i be of uncircumcised lip , and how shall pharaoh hearken unto i ?
and the lord say unto mose , see , i have make thee a god to pharaoh : and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet .
thou shalt speak all that i command thee : and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh , that he send the child of israel out of he land .
and i will harden pharaoh 's heart , and multiply my sign and my wonder in the land of egypt .
but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that i may lay my hand upon egypt , and bring forth mine army , and my people the child of israel , out of the land of egypt by great judgment .
and the egyptians shall know that i be the lord , when i stretch forth mine hand upon egypt , and bring out the child of israel from among they .
and moses and aaron do as the lord command they , so do they .
and moses be fourscore year old , and aaron fourscore and three year old , when they speak unto pharaoh .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
when pharaoh shall speak unto you , say , shew a miracle for you : then thou shalt say unto aaron , take thy rod , and cast it before pharaoh , and it shall become a serpent .
and moses and aaron go in unto pharaoh , and they do so as the lord have command : and aaron cast down he rod before pharaoh , and before he servant , and it become a serpent .
then pharaoh also call the wise man and the sorcerer : now the magician of egypt , they also do in like manner with they enchantment .
for they cast down every man he rod , and they become serpent : but aaron 's rod swallow up they rod .
and he harden pharaoh 's heart , that he hearken not unto they ; as the lord have say .
and the lord say unto mose , pharaoh 's heart be harden , he refuseth to let the people go .
get thee unto pharaoh in the morning ; lo , he goeth out unto the water ; and thou shalt stand by the river 's brink against he come ; and the rod which be turn to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand .
and thou shalt say unto he , the lord god of the hebrews have send i unto thee , say , let my people go , that they may serve i in the wilderness : and , behold , hitherto thou wouldest not hear .
thus saith the lord , in this thou shalt know that i be the lord : behold , i will smite with the rod that be in mine hand upon the water which be in the river , and they shall be turn to blood .
and the fish that be in the river shall die , and the river shall stink ; and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river .
and the lord speak unto mose , say unto aaron , take thy rod , and stretch out thine hand upon the water of egypt , upon they stream , upon they river , and upon they pond , and upon all they pool of water , that they may become blood ; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of egypt , both in vessel of wood , and in vessel of stone .
and moses and aaron do so , as the lord command ; and he lift up the rod , and smite the water that be in the river , in the sight of pharaoh , and in the sight of he servant ; and all the water that be in the river be turn to blood .
and the fish that be in the river die ; and the river stank , and the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there be blood throughout all the land of egypt .
and the magician of egypt do so with they enchantment : and pharaoh 's heart be harden , neither do he hearken unto they ; as the lord have say .
and pharaoh turn and go into he house , neither do he set he heart to this also .
and all the egyptians dig round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
and seven day be fulfil , after that the lord have smite the river .
and the lord speak unto mose , go unto pharaoh , and say unto he , thus saith the lord , let my people go , that they may serve i .
and if thou refuse to let they go , behold , i will smite all thy border with frog :
and the river shall bring forth frog abundantly , which shall go up and come into thine house , and into thy bedchamber , and upon thy bed , and into the house of thy servant , and upon thy people , and into thine oven , and into thy kneadingtrough :
and the frog shall come up both on thee , and upon thy people , and upon all thy servant .
and the lord speak unto mose , say unto aaron , stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the stream , over the river , and over the pond , and cause frog to come up upon the land of egypt .
and aaron stretch out he hand over the water of egypt ; and the frog come up , and cover the land of egypt .
and the magician do so with they enchantment , and bring up frog upon the land of egypt .
then pharaoh call for mose and aaron , and say , intreat the lord , that he may take away the frog from i , and from my people ; and i will let the people go , that they may do sacrifice unto the lord .
and moses say unto pharaoh , glory over i : when shall i intreat for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy people , to destroy the frog from thee and thy house , that they may remain in the river only ?
and he say , to morrow .
and he say , be it accord to thy word : that thou mayest know that there be none like unto the lord we god .
and the frog shall depart from thee , and from thy house , and from thy servant , and from thy people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and moses and aaron go out from pharaoh : and moses cry unto the lord because of the frog which he have bring against pharaoh .
and the lord do accord to the word of moses ; and the frog die out of the house , out of the village , and out of the field .
and they gather they together upon heap : and the land stank .
but when pharaoh see that there be respite , he harden he heart , and hearken not unto they ; as the lord have say .
and the lord say unto mose , say unto aaron , stretch out thy rod , and smite the dust of the land , that it may become louse throughout all the land of egypt .
and they do so ; for aaron stretch out he hand with he rod , and smite the dust of the earth , and it become louse in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land become louse throughout all the land of egypt .
and the magician do so with they enchantment to bring forth louse , but they could not : so there be louse upon man , and upon beast .
then the magician say unto pharaoh , this be the finger of god : and pharaoh 's heart be harden , and he hearken not unto they ; as the lord have say .
and the lord say unto mose , rise up early in the morning , and stand before pharaoh ; lo , he cometh forth to the water ; and say unto he , thus saith the lord , let my people go , that they may serve i .
else , if thou wilt not let my people go , behold , i will send swarm of fly upon thee , and upon thy servant , and upon thy people , and into thy house : and the house of the egyptians shall be full of swarm of fly , and also the ground whereon they be .
and i will sever in that day the land of goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarm of fly shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that i be the lord in the midst of the earth .
and i will put a division between my people and thy people : to morrow shall this sign be .
and the lord do so ; and there come a grievous swarm of fly into the house of pharaoh , and into he servant ' house , and into all the land of egypt : the land be corrupt by reason of the swarm of fly .
and pharaoh call for moses and for aaron , and say , go ye , sacrifice to you god in the land .
and moses say , it be not meet so to do ; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord we god : lo , shall we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before they eye , and will they not stone we ?
we will go three day ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to the lord we god , as he shall command we .
and pharaoh say , i will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the lord you god in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : intreat for i .
and moses say , behold , i go out from thee , and i will intreat the lord that the swarm of fly may depart from pharaoh , from he servant , and from he people , to morrow : but let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not let the people go to sacrifice to the lord .
and moses go out from pharaoh , and intreat the lord .
and the lord do accord to the word of moses ; and he remove the swarm of fly from pharaoh , from he servant , and from he people ; there remain not one .
and pharaoh harden he heart at this time also , neither would he let the people go .
then the lord say unto mose , go in unto pharaoh , and tell he , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , let my people go , that they may serve i .
for if thou refuse to let they go , and wilt hold they still ,
behold , the hand of the lord be upon thy cattle which be in the field , upon the horse , upon the ass , upon the camel , upon the ox , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very grievous murrain .
and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that be the child 's of israel .
and the lord appoint a set time , say , to morrow the lord shall do this thing in the land .
and the lord do that thing on the morrow , and all the cattle of egypt die : but of the cattle of the child of israel die not one .
and pharaoh send , and , behold , there be not one of the cattle of the israelites dead .
and the heart of pharaoh be harden , and he do not let the people go .
and the lord say unto mose and unto aaron , take to you handful of ash of the furnace , and let mose sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of pharaoh .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt , and shall be a boil break forth with blain upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of egypt .
and they take ash of the furnace , and stand before pharaoh ; and moses sprinkle it up toward heaven ; and it become a boil break forth with blain upon man , and upon beast .
and the magician could not stand before mose because of the boil ; for the boil be upon the magician , and upon all the egyptians .
and the lord harden the heart of pharaoh , and he hearken not unto they ; as the lord have speak unto mose .
and the lord say unto mose , rise up early in the morning , and stand before pharaoh , and say unto he , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , let my people go , that they may serve i .
for i will at this time send all my plague upon thine heart , and upon thy servant , and upon thy people ; that thou mayest know that there be none like i in all the earth .
for now i will stretch out my hand , that i may smite thee and thy people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
and in very deed for this cause have i raise thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declare throughout all the earth .
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people , that thou wilt not let they go ?
behold , to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as have not be in egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
send therefore now , and gather thy cattle , and all that thou hast in the field ; for upon every man and beast which shall be find in the field , and shall not be bring home , the hail shall come down upon they , and they shall die .
he that fear the word of the lord among the servant of pharaoh make he servant and he cattle flee into the house :
and he that regard not the word of the lord leave he servant and he cattle in the field .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch forth thine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of egypt , upon man , and upon beast , and upon every herb of the field , throughout the land of egypt .
and moses stretch forth he rod toward heaven : and the lord send thunder and hail , and the fire run along upon the ground ; and the lord rain hail upon the land of egypt .
so there be hail , and fire mingle with the hail , very grievous , such as there be none like it in all the land of egypt since it become a nation .
and the hail smite throughout all the land of egypt all that be in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smite every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
only in the land of goshen , where the child of israel be , be there no hail .
and pharaoh send , and call for mose and aaron , and say unto they , i have sin this time : the lord be righteous , and i and my people be wicked .
intreat the lord ( for it be enough ) that there be no more mighty thundering and hail ; and i will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
and moses say unto he , as soon as i be go out of the city , i will spread abroad my hand unto the lord ; and the thunder shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that thou mayest know how that the earth be the lord 's .
but as for thee and thy servant , i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god .
and the flax and the barley be smitten : for the barley be in the ear , and the flax be boll .
but the wheat and the rie be not smitten : for they be not grow up .
and moses go out of the city from pharaoh , and spread abroad he hand unto the lord : and the thunder and hail cease , and the rain be not pour upon the earth .
and when pharaoh see that the rain and the hail and the thunder be cease , he sin yet more , and harden he heart , he and he servant .
and the heart of pharaoh be harden , neither would he let the child of israel go ; as the lord have speak by moses .
and the lord say unto mose , go in unto pharaoh : for i have harden he heart , and the heart of he servant , that i might shew these my sign before he :
and that thou mayest tell in the ear of thy son , and of thy son 's son , what thing i have work in egypt , and my sign which i have do among they ; that ye may know how that i be the lord .
and moses and aaron come in unto pharaoh , and say unto he , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before i ? let my people go , that they may serve i .
else , if thou refuse to let my people go , behold , to morrow will i bring the locust into thy coast :
and they shall cover the face of the earth , that one can not be able to see the earth : and they shall eat the residue of that which be escape , which remaineth unto you from the hail , and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field :
and they shall fill thy house , and the house of all thy servant , and the house of all the egyptians ; which neither thy father , nor thy father ' father have see , since the day that they be upon the earth unto this day .
and he turn himself , and go out from pharaoh .
and pharaoh 's servant say unto he , how long shall this man be a snare unto we ? let the man go , that they may serve the lord they god : knowest thou not yet that egypt be destroy ?
and moses and aaron be bring again unto pharaoh : and he say unto they , go , serve the lord you god : but who be they that shall go ?
and moses say , we will go with we young and with we old , with we son and with we daughter , with we flock and with we herd will we go ; for we must hold a feast unto the lord .
and he say unto they , let the lord be so with you , as i will let you go , and you little one : look to it ; for evil be before you .
not so : go now ye that be man , and serve the lord ; for that ye do desire .
and they be drive out from pharaoh 's presence .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch out thine hand over the land of egypt for the locust , that they may come up upon the land of egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail have leave .
and moses stretch forth he rod over the land of egypt , and the lord bring a east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it be morning , the east wind bring the locust .
and the locust go up over all the land of egypt , and rest in all the coast of egypt : very grievous be they ; before they there be no such locust as they , neither after they shall be such .
for they cover the face of the whole earth , so that the land be darken ; and they do eat every herb of the land , and all the fruit of the tree which the hail have leave : and there remain not any green thing in the tree , or in the herb of the field , through all the land of egypt .
then pharaoh call for mose and aaron in haste ; and he say , i have sin against the lord you god , and against you .
now therefore forgive , i pray thee , my sin only this once , and intreat the lord you god , that he may take away from i this death only .
and he go out from pharaoh , and intreat the lord .
and the lord turn a mighty strong west wind , which take away the locust , and cast they into the red sea ; there remain not one locust in all the coast of egypt .
but the lord harden pharaoh 's heart , so that he would not let the child of israel go .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch out thine hand toward heaven , that there may be darkness over the land of egypt , even darkness which may be feel .
and moses stretch forth he hand toward heaven ; and there be a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three day :
they see not one another , neither rise any from he place for three day : but all the child of israel have light in they dwelling .
and pharaoh call unto mose , and say , go ye , serve the lord ; only let you flock and you herd be stay : let you little one also go with you .
and moses say , thou must give we also sacrifice and burnt offering , that we may sacrifice unto the lord we god .
we cattle also shall go with we ; there shall not a hoof be leave behind ; for thereof must we take to serve the lord we god ; and we know not with what we must serve the lord , until we come thither .
but the lord harden pharaoh 's heart , and he would not let they go .
and pharaoh say unto he , get thee from i , take heed to thyself , see my face no more ; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die .
and moses say , thou hast speak well , i will see thy face again no more .
and the lord say unto mose , yet will i bring one plague more upon pharaoh , and upon egypt ; afterwards he will let you go hence : when he shall let you go , he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether .
speak now in the ear of the people , and let every man borrow of he neighbour , and every woman of she neighbour , jewel of silver , and jewel of gold .
and the lord give the people favour in the sight of the egyptians .
moreover the man moses be very great in the land of egypt , in the sight of pharaoh 's servant , and in the sight of the people .
and moses say , thus saith the lord , about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt :
and all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die , from the first bear of pharaoh that sitteth upon he throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that be behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of beast .
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt , such as there be none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
but against any of the child of israel shall not a dog move he tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the lord doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel .
and all these thy servant shall come down unto i , and bow down themselves unto i , say , get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that i will go out .
and he go out from pharaoh in a great anger .
and the lord say unto mose , pharaoh shall not hearken unto you ; that my wonder may be multiply in the land of egypt .
and moses and aaron do all these wonder before pharaoh : and the lord harden pharaoh 's heart , so that he would not let the child of israel go out of he land .
and the lord speak unto mose and aaron in the land of egypt , say ,
this month shall be unto you the beginning of month : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
speak ye unto all the congregation of israel , say , in the tenth day of this month they shall take to they every man a lamb , accord to the house of they father , a lamb for a house :
and if the household be too little for the lamb , let he and he neighbour next unto he house take it accord to the number of the soul ; every man accord to he eating shall make you count for the lamb .
you lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goat :
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side post and on the upper door post of the house , wherein they shall eat it .
and they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; and with bitter herb they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roast with fire ; he head with he leg , and with the purtenance thereof .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with you loin gird , you shoe on you foot , and you staff in you hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste : it be the lord 's passover .
for i will pass through the land of egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the god of egypt i will execute judgment : i be the lord .
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the house where ye be : and when i see the blood , i will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when i smite the land of egypt .
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout you generation ; ye shall keep it a feast by a ordinance for ever .
seven day shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of you house : for whosoever eateth leaven bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from israel .
and in the first day there shall be a holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be do in they , save that which every man must eat , that only may be do of you .
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this selfsame day have i bring you army out of the land of egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in you generation by a ordinance for ever .
in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at even , ye shall eat unleavened bread , until the one and twentieth day of the month at even .
seven day shall there be no leaven find in you house : for whosoever eateth that which be leaven , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel , whether he be a stranger , or bear in the land .
ye shall eat nothing leaven ; in all you habitation shall ye eat unleavened bread .
then moses call for all the elder of israel , and say unto they , draw out and take you a lamb accord to you family , and kill the passover .
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that be in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side post with the blood that be in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of he house until the morning .
for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians ; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel , and on the two side post , the lord will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto you house to smite you .
and ye shall observe this thing for a ordinance to thee and to thy son for ever .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you , accord as he have promise , that ye shall keep this service .
and it shall come to pass , when you child shall say unto you , what mean ye by this service ?
that ye shall say , it be the sacrifice of the lord 's passover , who pass over the house of the child of israel in egypt , when he smite the egyptians , and deliver we house .
and the people bow the head and worship .
and the child of israel go away , and do as the lord have command moses and aaron , so do they .
and it come to pass , that at midnight the lord smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt , from the firstborn of pharaoh that sit on he throne unto the firstborn of the captive that be in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of cattle .
and pharaoh rise up in the night , he , and all he servant , and all the egyptians ; and there be a great cry in egypt ; for there be not a house where there be not one dead .
and he call for moses and aaron by night , and say , rise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the child of israel ; and go , serve the lord , as ye have say .
also take you flock and you herd , as ye have say , and be go ; and bless i also .
and the egyptians be urgent upon the people , that they might send they out of the land in haste ; for they say , we be all dead man .
and the people take they dough before it be leaven , they kneadingtrough be bind up in they clothes upon they shoulder .
and the child of israel do accord to the word of moses ; and they borrow of the egyptians jewel of silver , and jewel of gold , and raiment :
and the lord give the people favour in the sight of the egyptians , so that they lend unto they such thing as they require .
and they spoil the egyptians .
and the child of israel journey from rameses to succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that be man , beside child .
and a mixed multitude go up also with they ; and flock , and herd , even very much cattle .
and they baked unleavened cake of the dough which they bring forth out of egypt , for it be not leaven ; because they be thrust out of egypt , and could not tarry , neither have they prepare for themselves any victual .
now the sojourning of the child of israel , who dwell in egypt , be four hundred and thirty year .
and it come to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty year , even the selfsame day it come to pass , that all the host of the lord go out from the land of egypt .
it be a night to be much observe unto the lord for bring they out from the land of egypt : this be that night of the lord to be observe of all the child of israel in they generation .
and the lord say unto mose and aaron , this be the ordinance of the passover : there shall no stranger eat thereof :
but every man 's servant that be buy for money , when thou hast circumcise he , then shall he eat thereof .
a foreigner and a hire servant shall not eat thereof .
in one house shall it be eat ; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
all the congregation of israel shall keep it .
and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee , and will keep the passover to the lord , let all he male be circumcise , and then let he come near and keep it ; and he shall be as one that be bear in the land : for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof .
one law shall be to he that be homeborn , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you .
thus do all the child of israel ; as the lord command moses and aaron , so do they .
and it come to pass the selfsame day , that the lord do bring the child of israel out of the land of egypt by they army .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
sanctify unto i all the firstborn , whatsoever openeth the womb among the child of israel , both of man and of beast : it be mine .
and moses say unto the people , remember this day , in which ye come out from egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the lord bring you out from this place : there shall no leavened bread be eat .
this day come ye out in the month abib .
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites , and the hittites , and the amorites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , which he sware unto thy father to give thee , a land flow with milk and honey , that thou shalt keep this service in this month .
seven day thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord .
unleavened bread shall be eat seven day ; and there shall no leavened bread be see with thee , neither shall there be leaven see with thee in all thy quarter .
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day , say , this be do because of that which the lord do unto i when i come forth out of egypt .
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eye , that the lord 's law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hand have the lord bring thee out of egypt .
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in he season from year to year .
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites , as he sware unto thee and to thy father , and shall give it thee ,
that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the matrix , and every firstle that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the male shall be the lord 's .
and every firstling of a ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb ; and if thou wilt not redeem it , then thou shalt break he neck : and all the firstborn of man among thy child shalt thou redeem .
and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come , say , what be this ? that thou shalt say unto he , by strength of hand the lord bring we out from egypt , from the house of bondage :
and it come to pass , when pharaoh would hardly let we go , that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt , both the firstborn of man , and the firstborn of beast : therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the matrix , be male ; but all the firstborn of my child i redeem .
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand , and for frontlet between thine eye : for by strength of hand the lord bring we forth out of egypt .
and it come to pass , when pharaoh have let the people go , that god lead they not through the way of the land of the philistines , although that be near ; for god say , lest peradventure the people repent when they see war , and they return to egypt :
but god lead the people about , through the way of the wilderness of the red sea : and the child of israel go up harness out of the land of egypt .
and moses take the bone of joseph with he : for he have straitly swear the child of israel , say , god will surely visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bone away hence with you .
and they take they journey from succoth , and encamp in etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
and the lord go before they by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead they the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give they light ; to go by day and night :
he take not away the pillar of the cloud by day , nor the pillar of fire by night , from before the people .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , that they turn and encamp before pihahiroth , between migdol and the sea , over against baalzephon : before it shall ye encamp by the sea .
for pharaoh will say of the child of israel , they be entangled in the land , the wilderness have shut they in .
and i will harden pharaoh 's heart , that he shall follow after they ; and i will be honour upon pharaoh , and upon all he host ; that the egyptians may know that i be the lord .
and they do so .
and it be tell the king of egypt that the people flee : and the heart of pharaoh and of he servant be turn against the people , and they say , why have we do this , that we have let israel go from serve we ?
and he make ready he chariot , and take he people with he :
and he take six hundred choose chariot , and all the chariot of egypt , and captain over every one of they .
and the lord harden the heart of pharaoh king of egypt , and he pursue after the child of israel : and the child of israel go out with a high hand .
but the egyptians pursue after they , all the horse and chariot of pharaoh , and he horseman , and he army , and overtake they encamp by the sea , beside pihahiroth , before baalzephon .
and when pharaoh draw nigh , the child of israel lift up they eye , and , behold , the egyptians march after they ; and they be sore afraid : and the child of israel cry out unto the lord .
and they say unto mose , because there be no grave in egypt , hast thou take we away to die in the wilderness ? wherefore hast thou deal thus with we , to carry we forth out of egypt ?
be not this the word that we do tell thee in egypt , say , let we alone , that we may serve the egyptians ?
for it have be better for we to serve the egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
and moses say unto the people , fear ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the lord , which he will shew to you to day : for the egyptians whom ye have see to day , ye shall see they again no more for ever .
the lord shall fight for you , and ye shall hold you peace .
and the lord say unto moses , wherefore criest thou unto i ? speak unto the child of israel , that they go forward :
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the child of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and i , behold , i will harden the heart of the egyptians , and they shall follow they : and i will get i honour upon pharaoh , and upon all he host , upon he chariot , and upon he horseman .
and the egyptians shall know that i be the lord , when i have get i honour upon pharaoh , upon he chariot , and upon he horseman .
and the angel of god , which go before the camp of israel , remove and go behind they ; and the pillar of the cloud go from before they face , and stand behind they :
and it come between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel ; and it be a cloud and darkness to they , but it give light by night to these : so that the one come not near the other all the night .
and moses stretch out he hand over the sea ; and the lord cause the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and make the sea dry land , and the water be divide .
and the child of israel go into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the water be a wall unto they on they right hand , and on they leave .
and the egyptians pursue , and go in after they to the midst of the sea , even all pharaoh 's horse , he chariot , and he horseman .
and it come to pass , that in the morning watch the lord look unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and trouble the host of the egyptians ,
and take off they chariot wheel , that they drave they heavily : so that the egyptians say , let we flee from the face of israel ; for the lord fighteth for they against the egyptians .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch out thine hand over the sea , that the water may come again upon the egyptians , upon they chariot , and upon they horseman .
and moses stretch forth he hand over the sea , and the sea return to he strength when the morning appear ; and the egyptians flee against it ; and the lord overthrow the egyptians in the midst of the sea .
and the water return , and cover the chariot , and the horseman , and all the host of pharaoh that come into the sea after they ; there remain not so much as one of they .
but the child of israel walk upon dry land in the midst of the sea ; and the water be a wall unto they on they right hand , and on they leave .
thus the lord save israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians ; and israel see the egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
and israel see that great work which the lord do upon the egyptians : and the people fear the lord , and believe the lord , and he servant mose .
then sing moses and the child of israel this song unto the lord , and spake , say , i will sing unto the lord , for he have triumph gloriously : the horse and he rider have he throw into the sea .
the lord be my strength and song , and he be become my salvation : he be my god , and i will prepare he a habitation ; my father 's god , and i will exalt he .
the lord be a man of war : the lord be he name .
pharaoh 's chariot and he host have he cast into the sea : he choose captain also be drown in the red sea .
the depths have cover they : they sink into the bottom as a stone .
thy right hand , o lord , be become glorious in power : thy right hand , o lord , have dash in piece the enemy .
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrow they that rise up against thee : thou sentest forth thy wrath , which consume they as stubble .
and with the blast of thy nostril the water be gather together , the flood stand upright as a heap , and the depths be congeal in the heart of the sea .
the enemy say , i will pursue , i will overtake , i will divide the spoil ; my lust shall be satisfy upon they ; i will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy they .
thou didst blow with thy wind , the sea cover they : they sink as lead in the mighty water .
who be like unto thee , o lord , among the god ? who be like thee , glorious in holiness , fearful in praise , do wonder ?
thou stretchedst out thy right hand , the earth swallow they .
thou in thy mercy hast lead forth the people which thou hast redeem : thou hast guide they in thy strength unto thy holy habitation .
the people shall hear , and be afraid : sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitant of palestina .
then the duke of edom shall be amaze ; the mighty man of moab , tremble shall take hold upon they ; all the inhabitant of canaan shall melt away .
fear and dread shall fall upon they ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till thy people pass over , o lord , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchase .
thou shalt bring they in , and plant they in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , o lord , which thou hast make for thee to dwell in , in the sanctuary , o lord , which thy hand have establish .
the lord shall reign for ever and ever .
for the horse of pharaoh go in with he chariot and with he horseman into the sea , and the lord bring again the water of the sea upon they ; but the child of israel go on dry land in the midst of the sea .
and miriam the prophetess , the sister of aaron , take a timbrel in she hand ; and all the woman go out after she with timbrel and with dance .
and miriam answer they , sing ye to the lord , for he have triumph gloriously ; the horse and he rider have he throw into the sea .
so mose bring israel from the red sea , and they go out into the wilderness of shur ; and they go three day in the wilderness , and find no water .
and when they come to marah , they could not drink of the water of marah , for they be bitter : therefore the name of it be call marah .
and the people murmur against moses , say , what shall we drink ?
and he cry unto the lord ; and the lord shew he a tree , which when he have cast into the water , the water be make sweet : there he make for they a statute and a ordinance , and there he prove they ,
and say , if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god , and wilt do that which be right in he sight , and wilt give ear to he commandment , and keep all he statute , i will put none of these disease upon thee , which i have bring upon the egyptians : for i be the lord that healeth thee .
and they come to elim , where be twelve well of water , and threescore and ten palm tree : and they encamp there by the water .
and they take they journey from elim , and all the congregation of the child of israel come unto the wilderness of sin , which be between elim and sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after they depart out of the land of egypt .
and the whole congregation of the child of israel murmur against moses and aaron in the wilderness :
and the child of israel say unto they , would to god we have die by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt , when we sit by the flesh pot , and when we do eat bread to the full ; for ye have bring we forth into this wilderness , to kill this whole assembly with hunger .
then say the lord unto moses , behold , i will rain bread from heaven for you ; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day , that i may prove they , whether they will walk in my law , or no. .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and moses and aaron say unto all the child of israel , at even , then ye shall know that the lord have bring you out from the land of egypt :
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the lord ; for that he heareth you murmuring against the lord : and what be we , that ye murmur against we ?
and moses say , this shall be , when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat , and in the morning bread to the full ; for that the lord heareth you murmuring which ye murmur against he : and what be we ? you murmuring be not against we , but against the lord .
and moses spake unto aaron , say unto all the congregation of the child of israel , come near before the lord : for he have hear you murmuring .
and it come to pass , as aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the child of israel , that they look toward the wilderness , and , behold , the glory of the lord appear in the cloud .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
i have hear the murmuring of the child of israel : speak unto they , say , at even ye shall eat flesh , and in the morning ye shall be fill with bread ; and ye shall know that i be the lord you god .
and it come to pass , that at even the quail come up , and cover the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when the dew that lay be go up , behold , upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing , as small as the hoar frost on the ground .
and when the child of israel see it , they say one to another , it be manna : for they wist not what it be .
and moses say unto they , this be the bread which the lord have give you to eat .
this be the thing which the lord have command , gather of it every man accord to he eating , a omer for every man , accord to the number of you person ; take ye every man for they which be in he tent .
and the child of israel do so , and gather , some more , some less .
and when they do mete it with a omer , he that gather much have nothing over , and he that gather little have no lack ; they gather every man accord to he eating .
and moses say , let no man leave of it till the morning .
notwithstanding they hearken not unto mose ; but some of they leave of it until the morning , and it breed worm , and stank : and moses be wroth with they .
and they gather it every morning , every man accord to he eating : and when the sun wax hot , it melt .
and it come to pass , that on the sixth day they gather twice as much bread , two omer for one man : and all the ruler of the congregation come and tell moses .
and he say unto they , this be that which the lord have say , to morrow be the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord : bake that which ye will bake to day , and seethe that ye will seethe ; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be keep until the morning .
and they lay it up till the morning , as moses bid : and it do not stink , neither be there any worm therein .
and moses say , eat that to day ; for to day be a sabbath unto the lord : to day ye shall not find it in the field .
six day ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which be the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
and it come to pass , that there go out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather , and they find none .
and the lord say unto mose , how long refuse ye to keep my commandment and my law ?
see , for that the lord have give you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two day ; abide ye every man in he place , let no man go out of he place on the seventh day .
so the people rest on the seventh day .
and the house of israel call the name thereof manna : and it be like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it be like wafer make with honey .
and moses say , this be the thing which the lord commandeth , fill a omer of it to be keep for you generation ; that they may see the bread wherewith i have feed you in the wilderness , when i bring you forth from the land of egypt .
and moses say unto aaron , take a pot , and put a omer full of manna therein , and lay it up before the lord , to be keep for you generation .
as the lord command moses , so aaron lay it up before the testimony , to be keep .
and the child of israel do eat manna forty year , until they come to a land inhabit ; they do eat manna , until they come unto the border of the land of canaan .
now a omer be the tenth part of a ephah .
and all the congregation of the child of israel journey from the wilderness of sin , after they journey , accord to the commandment of the lord , and pitch in rephidim : and there be no water for the people to drink .
wherefore the people do chide with mose , and say , give we water that we may drink .
and moses say unto they , why chide ye with i ? wherefore do ye tempt the lord ?
and the people thirst there for water ; and the people murmur against moses , and say , wherefore be this that thou hast bring we up out of egypt , to kill we and we child and we cattle with thirst ?
and moses cry unto the lord , say , what shall i do unto this people ? they be almost ready to stone i .
and the lord say unto mose , go on before the people , and take with thee of the elder of israel ; and thy rod , wherewith thou smotest the river , take in thine hand , and go .
behold , i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink .
and moses do so in the sight of the elder of israel .
and he call the name of the place massah , and meribah , because of the chiding of the child of israel , and because they tempt the lord , say , be the lord among we , or not ?
then come amalek , and fight with israel in rephidim .
and moses say unto joshua , choose we out man , and go out , fight with amalek : to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in mine hand .
so joshua do as moses have say to he , and fight with amalek : and moses , aaron , and hur go up to the top of the hill .
and it come to pass , when moses hold up he hand , that israel prevail : and when he let down he hand , amalek prevail .
but moses ' hand be heavy ; and they take a stone , and put it under he , and he sit thereon ; and aaron and hur stay up he hand , the one on the one side , and the other on the other side ; and he hand be steady until the go down of the sun .
and joshua discomfited amalek and he people with the edge of the sword .
and the lord say unto mose , write this for a memorial in a book , and rehearse it in the ear of joshua : for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven .
and moses build a altar , and call the name of it jehovahnissus :
for he say , because the lord have swear that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation .
when jethro , the priest of midian , moses ' father in law , hear of all that god have do for moses , and for israel he people , and that the lord have bring israel out of egypt ;
then jethro , moses ' father in law , take zipporah , moses ' wife , after he have send she back ,
and she two son ; of which the name of the one be gershom ; for he say , i have be a alien in a strange land :
and the name of the other be eliezer ; for the god of my father , say he , be mine help , and deliver i from the sword of pharaoh :
and jethro , moses ' father in law , come with he son and he wife unto mose into the wilderness , where he encamp at the mount of god :
and he say unto mose , i thy father in law jethro be come unto thee , and thy wife , and she two son with she .
and moses go out to meet he father in law , and do obeisance , and kiss he ; and they ask each other of they welfare ; and they come into the tent .
and moses tell he father in law all that the lord have do unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israel 's sake , and all the travail that have come upon they by the way , and how the lord deliver they .
and jethro rejoice for all the goodness which the lord have do to israel , whom he have deliver out of the hand of the egyptians .
and jethro say , blessed be the lord , who have deliver you out of the hand of the egyptians , and out of the hand of pharaoh , who have deliver the people from under the hand of the egyptians .
now i know that the lord be greater than all god : for in the thing wherein they deal proudly he be above they .
and jethro , moses ' father in law , take a burnt offering and sacrifice for god : and aaron come , and all the elder of israel , to eat bread with mose ' father in law before god .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that mose sit to judge the people : and the people stand by mose from the morning unto the evening .
and when moses ' father in law see all that he do to the people , he say , what be this thing that thou doest to the people ? why sittest thou thyself alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ?
and moses say unto he father in law , because the people come unto i to enquire of god :
when they have a matter , they come unto i ; and i judge between one and another , and i do make they know the statute of god , and he law .
and moses ' father in law say unto he , the thing that thou doest be not good .
thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that be with thee : for this thing be too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
hearken now unto my voice , i will give thee counsel , and god shall be with thee : be thou for the people to god-ward , that thou mayest bring the cause unto god :
and thou shalt teach they ordinance and law , and shalt shew they the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able man , such as fear god , man of truth , hate covetousness ; and place such over they , to be ruler of thousand , and ruler of hundred , ruler of fifty , and ruler of ten :
and let they judge the people at all season : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
if thou shalt do this thing , and god command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to they place in peace .
so mose hearken to the voice of he father in law , and do all that he have say .
and moses choose able man out of all israel , and make they head over the people , ruler of thousand , ruler of hundred , ruler of fifty , and ruler of ten .
and they judge the people at all season : the hard cause they bring unto mose , but every small matter they judge themselves .
and moses let he father in law depart ; and he go he way into he own land .
in the third month , when the child of israel be go forth out of the land of egypt , the same day come they into the wilderness of sinai .
for they be depart from rephidim , and be come to the desert of sinai , and have pitch in the wilderness ; and there israel camp before the mount .
and moses go up unto god , and the lord call unto he out of the mountain , say , thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob , and tell the child of israel ;
ye have see what i do unto the egyptians , and how i bare you on eagle ' wing , and bring you unto myself .
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto i above all people : for all the earth be mine :
and ye shall be unto i a kingdom of priest , and a holy nation .
these be the word which thou shalt speak unto the child of israel .
and moses come and call for the elder of the people , and lay before they face all these word which the lord command he .
and all the people answer together , and say , all that the lord have speak we will do .
and moses return the word of the people unto the lord .
and the lord say unto mose , lo , i come unto thee in a thick cloud , that the people may hear when i speak with thee , and believe thee for ever .
and moses tell the word of the people unto the lord .
and the lord say unto mose , go unto the people , and sanctify they to day and to morrow , and let they wash they clothes ,
and be ready against the third day : for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai .
and thou shalt set bound unto the people round about , say , take heed to yourselve , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death :
there shall not a hand touch it , but he shall surely be stone , or shoot through ; whether it be beast or man , it shall not live : when the trumpet soundeth long , they shall come up to the mount .
and moses go down from the mount unto the people , and sanctify the people ; and they wash they clothes .
and he say unto the people , be ready against the third day : come not at you wife .
and it come to pass on the third day in the morning , that there be thunder and lightning , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceed loud ; so that all the people that be in the camp tremble .
and moses bring forth the people out of the camp to meet with god ; and they stand at the nether part of the mount .
and mount sinai be altogether on a smoke , because the lord descend upon it in fire : and the smoke thereof ascend as the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mount quake greatly .
and when the voice of the trumpet sound long , and wax louder and louder , moses spake , and god answer he by a voice .
and the lord come down upon mount sinai , on the top of the mount : and the lord call moses up to the top of the mount ; and moses go up .
and the lord say unto mose , go down , charge the people , lest they break through unto the lord to gaze , and many of they perish .
and let the priest also , which come near to the lord , sanctify themselves , lest the lord break forth upon they .
and moses say unto the lord , the people can not come up to mount sinai : for thou chargedst we , say , set bound about the mount , and sanctify it .
and the lord say unto he , away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and aaron with thee : but let not the priest and the people break through to come up unto the lord , lest he break forth upon they .
so moses go down unto the people , and spake unto they .
and god speak all these word , say ,
i be the lord thy god , which have bring thee out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondage .
thou shalt have no other god before i .
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that be in heaven above , or that be in the earth beneath , or that be in the water under the earth :
thou shalt not bow down thyself to they , nor serve they : for i the lord thy god be a jealous god , visit the iniquity of the father upon the child unto the third and fourth generation of they that hate i ;
and shew mercy unto thousand of they that love i , and keep my commandment .
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain ; for the lord will not hold he guiltless that taketh he name in vain .
remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy .
six day shalt thou labour , and do all thy work :
but the seventh day be the sabbath of the lord thy god : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that be within thy gate :
for in six day the lord make heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in they be , and rest the seventh day : wherefore the lord bless the sabbath day , and hallowed it .
honour thy father and thy mother : that thy day may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
thou shalt not kill .
thou shalt not commit adultery .
thou shalt not steal .
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour .
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's wife , nor he manservant , nor he maidservant , nor he ox , nor he ass , nor any thing that be thy neighbour 's .
and all the people see the thundering , and the lightning , and the noise of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking : and when the people see it , they remove , and stand afar off .
and they say unto mose , speak thou with we , and we will hear : but let not god speak with we , lest we die .
and moses say unto the people , fear not : for god be come to prove you , and that he fear may be before you face , that ye sin not .
and the people stand afar off , and moses draw near unto the thick darkness where god be .
and the lord say unto mose , thus thou shalt say unto the child of israel , ye have see that i have talk with you from heaven .
ye shall not make with i god of silver , neither shall ye make unto you god of gold .
a altar of earth thou shalt make unto i , and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offering , and thy peace offering , thy sheep , and thine ox : in all place where i record my name i will come unto thee , and i will bless thee .
and if thou wilt make i a altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hew stone : for if thou lift up thy tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
neither shalt thou go up by step unto mine altar , that thy nakedness be not discover thereon .
now these be the judgment which thou shalt set before they .
if thou buy a hebrew servant , six year he shall serve : and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing .
if he come in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he be marry , then he wife shall go out with he .
if he master have give he a wife , and she have bear he son or daughter ; the wife and she child shall be she master 's , and he shall go out by himself .
and if the servant shall plainly say , i love my master , my wife , and my child ; i will not go out free :
then he master shall bring he unto the judge ; he shall also bring he to the door , or unto the door post ; and he master shall bear he ear through with a aul ; and he shall serve he for ever .
and if a man sell he daughter to be a maidservant , she shall not go out as the manservant do .
if she please not she master , who have betroth she to himself , then shall he let she be redeem : to sell she unto a strange nation he shall have no power , see he have deal deceitfully with she .
and if he have betroth she unto he son , he shall deal with she after the manner of daughter .
if he take he another wife ; she food , she raiment , and she duty of marriage , shall he not diminish .
and if he do not these three unto she , then shall she go out free without money .
he that smiteth a man , so that he die , shall be surely put to death .
and if a man lie not in wait , but god deliver he into he hand ; then i will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
but if a man come presumptuously upon he neighbour , to slay he with guile ; thou shalt take he from mine altar , that he may die .
and he that smiteth he father , or he mother , shall be surely put to death .
and he that stealeth a man , and selleth he , or if he be find in he hand , he shall surely be put to death .
and he that curseth he father , or he mother , shall surely be put to death .
and if man strive together , and one smite another with a stone , or with he fist , and he die not , but keepeth he bed :
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon he staff , then shall he that smite he be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of he time , and shall cause he to be thoroughly heal .
and if a man smite he servant , or he maid , with a rod , and he die under he hand ; he shall be surely punish .
notwithstanding , if he continue a day or two , he shall not be punish : for he be he money .
if man strive , and hurt a woman with child , so that she fruit depart from she , and yet no mischief follow : he shall be surely punish , accord as the woman 's husband will lay upon he ; and he shall pay as the judge determine .
and if any mischief follow , then thou shalt give life for life ,
eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ,
burning for burning , wound for wound , stripe for stripe .
and if a man smite the eye of he servant , or the eye of he maid , that it perish ; he shall let he go free for he eye 's sake .
and if he smite out he manservant 's tooth , or he maidservant 's tooth ; he shall let he go free for he tooth 's sake .
if a ox gore a man or a woman , that they die : then the ox shall be surely stone , and he flesh shall not be eat ; but the owner of the ox shall be quit .
but if the ox be wont to push with he horn in time past , and it have be testify to he owner , and he have not keep he in , but that he have kill a man or a woman ; the ox shall be stone , and he owner also shall be put to death .
if there be lay on he a sum of money , then he shall give for the ransom of he life whatsoever be lay upon he .
whether he have gore a son , or have gore a daughter , accord to this judgment shall it be do unto he .
if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant ; he shall give unto they master thirty shekel of silver , and the ox shall be stone .
and if a man shall open a pit , or if a man shall dig a pit , and not cover it , and a ox or a ass fall therein ;
the owner of the pit shall make it good , and give money unto the owner of they ; and the dead beast shall be he .
and if one man 's ox hurt another 's , that he die ; then they shall sell the live ox , and divide the money of it ; and the dead ox also they shall divide .
or if it be know that the ox have use to push in time past , and he owner have not keep he in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be he own .
if a man shall steal a ox , or a sheep , and kill it , or sell it ; he shall restore five ox for a ox , and four sheep for a sheep .
if a thief be find break up , and be smite that he die , there shall no blood be shed for he .
if the sun be rise upon he , there shall be blood shed for he ; for he should make full restitution ; if he have nothing , then he shall be sell for he theft .
if the theft be certainly find in he hand alive , whether it be ox , or ass , or sheep ; he shall restore double .
if a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eat , and shall put in he beast , and shall feed in another man 's field ; of the best of he own field , and of the best of he own vineyard , shall he make restitution .
if fire break out , and catch in thorn , so that the stack of corn , or the standing corn , or the field , be consume therewith ; he that kindle the fire shall surely make restitution .
if a man shall deliver unto he neighbour money or stuff to keep , and it be steal out of the man 's house ; if the thief be find , let he pay double .
if the thief be not find , then the master of the house shall be bring unto the judge , to see whether he have put he hand unto he neighbour 's goods .
for all manner of trespass , whether it be for ox , for ass , for sheep , for raiment , or for any manner of lose thing , which another challengeth to be he , the cause of both party shall come before the judge ; and whom the judge shall condemn , he shall pay double unto he neighbour .
if a man deliver unto he neighbour a ass , or a ox , or a sheep , or any beast , to keep ; and it die , or be hurt , or drive away , no man see it :
then shall a oath of the lord be between they both , that he have not put he hand unto he neighbour 's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
and if it be steal from he , he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof .
if it be tear in piece , then let he bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which be tear .
and if a man borrow ought of he neighbour , and it be hurt , or die , the owner thereof be not with it , he shall surely make it good .
but if the owner thereof be with it , he shall not make it good : if it be a hire thing , it come for he hire .
and if a man entice a maid that be not betroth , and lie with she , he shall surely endow she to be he wife .
if she father utterly refuse to give she unto he , he shall pay money accord to the dowry of virgin .

ye shall keep the sabbath therefore ; for it be holy unto you : every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death : for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among he people .
six day may work be do ; but in the seventh be the sabbath of rest , holy to the lord : whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
wherefore the child of israel shall keep the sabbath , to observe the sabbath throughout they generation , for a perpetual covenant .

and he give unto mose , when he have make a end of commune with he upon mount sinai , two table of testimony , table of stone , write with the finger of god .
and when the people see that mose delay to come down out of the mount , the people gather themselves together unto aaron , and say unto he , up , make we god , which shall go before we ; for as for this moses , the man that bring we up out of the land of egypt , we wot not what be become of he .
and aaron say unto they , break off the golden earring , which be in the ear of you wife , of you son , and of you daughter , and bring they unto i .
and all the people brake off the golden earring which be in they ear , and bring they unto aaron .
and he receive they at they hand , and fashion it with a graving tool , after he have make it a molten calf : and they say , these be thy god , o israel , which bring thee up out of the land of egypt .
and when aaron see it , he build a altar before it ; and aaron make proclamation , and say , to morrow be a feast to the lord .
and they rise up early on the morrow , and offer burnt offering , and bring peace offering ; and the people sit down to eat and to drink , and rise up to play .
and the lord say unto mose , go , get thee down ; for thy people , which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt , have corrupt themselves :
they have turn aside quickly out of the way which i command they : they have make they a molten calf , and have worship it , and have sacrifice thereunto , and say , these be thy god , o israel , which have bring thee up out of the land of egypt .
and the lord say unto mose , i have see this people , and , behold , it be a stiffnecked people :
now therefore let i alone , that my wrath may wax hot against they , and that i may consume they : and i will make of thee a great nation .
and moses beseech the lord he god , and say , lord , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people , which thou hast bring forth out of the land of egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
wherefore should the egyptians speak , and say , for mischief do he bring they out , to slay they in the mountain , and to consume they from the face of the earth ?
turn from thy fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against thy people .
remember abraham , isaac , and israel , thy servant , to whom thou swarest by thine own self , and saidst unto they , i will multiply you seed as the star of heaven , and all this land that i have speak of will i give unto you seed , and they shall inherit it for ever .
and the lord repent of the evil which he think to do unto he people .
and moses turn , and go down from the mount , and the two table of the testimony be in he hand : the table be write on both they side ; on the one side and on the other be they write .
and the table be the work of god , and the writing be the writing of god , grave upon the table .
and when joshua hear the noise of the people as they shout , he say unto mose , there be a noise of war in the camp .
and he say , it be not the voice of they that shout for mastery , neither be it the voice of they that cry for be overcome : but the noise of they that sing do i hear .
and it come to pass , as soon as he come nigh unto the camp , that he see the calf , and the dancing : and moses ' anger wax hot , and he cast the table out of he hand , and brake they beneath the mount .
and he take the calf which they have make , and burn it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and straw it upon the water , and make the child of israel drink of it .
and moses say unto aaron , what do this people unto thee , that thou hast bring so great a sin upon they ?
and aaron say , let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they be set on mischief .
for they say unto i , make we god , which shall go before we : for as for this moses , the man that bring we up out of the land of egypt , we wot not what be become of he .
and i say unto they , whosoever have any gold , let they break it off .
so they give it i : then i cast it into the fire , and there come out this calf .
and when moses see that the people be naked ; ( for aaron have make they naked unto they shame among they enemy : )
then moses stand in the gate of the camp , and say , who be on the lord 's side ? let he come unto i .
and all the son of levi gather themselves together unto he .
and he say unto they , thus saith the lord god of israel , put every man he sword by he side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man he brother , and every man he companion , and every man he neighbour .
and the child of levi do accord to the word of moses : and there fall of the people that day about three thousand man .
for mose have say , consecrate yourselve today to the lord , even every man upon he son , and upon he brother ; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that mose say unto the people , ye have sin a great sin : and now i will go up unto the lord ; peradventure i shall make a atonement for you sin .
and moses return unto the lord , and say , oh , this people have sin a great sin , and have make they god of gold .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive they sin ; and if not , blot i , i pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast write .
and the lord say unto mose , whosoever have sin against i , he will i blot out of my book .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which i have speak unto thee : behold , mine angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit they sin upon they .
and the lord plague the people , because they make the calf , which aaron make .
and the lord say unto mose , depart , and go up hence , thou and the people which thou hast bring up out of the land of egypt , unto the land which i sware unto abraham , to isaac , and to jacob , say , unto thy seed will i give it :
and i will send a angel before thee ; and i will drive out the canaanite , the amorite , and the hittite , and the perizzite , the hivite , and the jebusite :
unto a land flow with milk and honey : for i will not go up in the midst of thee ; for thou art a stiffnecked people : lest i consume thee in the way .
and when the people hear these evil tiding , they mourn : and no man do put on he he ornament .
for the lord have say unto mose , say unto the child of israel , ye be a stiffnecked people : i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment , and consume thee : therefore now put off thy ornament from thee , that i may know what to do unto thee .
and the child of israel strip themselves of they ornament by the mount horeb .
and moses take the tabernacle , and pitch it without the camp , afar off from the camp , and call it the tabernacle of the congregation .
and it come to pass , that every one which seek the lord go out unto the tabernacle of the congregation , which be without the camp .
and it come to pass , when moses go out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rise up , and stand every man at he tent door , and look after moses , until he be go into the tabernacle .
and it come to pass , as moses enter into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descend , and stand at the door of the tabernacle , and the lord talk with mose .
and all the people see the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door : and all the people rise up and worship , every man in he tent door .
and the lord speak unto mose face to face , as a man speaketh unto he friend .
and he turn again into the camp : but he servant joshua , the son of nun , a young man , depart not out of the tabernacle .
and moses say unto the lord , see , thou sayest unto i , bring up this people : and thou hast not let i know whom thou wilt send with i .
yet thou hast say , i know thee by name , and thou hast also find grace in my sight .
now therefore , i pray thee , if i have find grace in thy sight , shew i now thy way , that i may know thee , that i may find grace in thy sight : and consider that this nation be thy people .
and he say , my presence shall go with thee , and i will give thee rest .
and he say unto he , if thy presence go not with i , carry we not up hence .
for wherein shall it be know here that i and thy people have find grace in thy sight ? be it not in that thou goest with we ? so shall we be separate , i and thy people , from all the people that be upon the face of the earth .
and the lord say unto mose , i will do this thing also that thou hast speak : for thou hast find grace in my sight , and i know thee by name .
and he say , i beseech thee , shew i thy glory .
and he say , i will make all my goodness pass before thee , and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee ; and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious , and will shew mercy on whom i will shew mercy .
and he say , thou canst not see my face : for there shall no man see i , and live .
and the lord say , behold , there be a place by i , and thou shalt stand upon a rock :
and it shall come to pass , while my glory passeth by , that i will put thee in a clift of the rock , and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by :
and i will take away mine hand , and thou shalt see my back part : but my face shall not be see .
and the lord say unto mose , hew thee two table of stone like unto the first : and i will write upon these table the word that be in the first table , which thou brakest .
and be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount sinai , and present thyself there to i in the top of the mount .
and no man shall come up with thee , neither let any man be see throughout all the mount ; neither let the flock nor herd feed before that mount .
and he hew two table of stone like unto the first ; and moses rise up early in the morning , and go up unto mount sinai , as the lord have command he , and take in he hand the two table of stone .
and the lord descend in the cloud , and stand with he there , and proclaim the name of the lord .
and the lord pass by before he , and proclaim , the lord , the lord god , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness and truth ,
keep mercy for thousand , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visit the iniquity of the father upon the child , and upon the child 's child , unto the third and to the fourth generation .
and moses make haste , and bow he head toward the earth , and worship .
and he say , if now i have find grace in thy sight , o lord , let my lord , i pray thee , go among we ; for it be a stiffnecked people ; and pardon we iniquity and we sin , and take we for thine inheritance .
and he say , behold , i make a covenant : before all thy people i will do marvel , such as have not be do in all the earth , nor in any nation : and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord : for it be a terrible thing that i will do with thee .
observe thou that which i command thee this day : behold , i drive out before thee the amorite , and the canaanite , and the hittite , and the perizzite , and the hivite , and the jebusite .
take heed to thyself , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
but ye shall destroy they altar , break they image , and cut down they grove :
for thou shalt worship no other god : for the lord , whose name be jealous , be a jealous god :
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land , and they go a whoring after they god , and do sacrifice unto they god , and one call thee , and thou eat of he sacrifice ;
and thou take of they daughter unto thy son , and they daughter go a whoring after they god , and make thy son go a whoring after they god .
thou shalt make thee no molten god .
the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep .
seven day thou shalt eat unleavened bread , as i command thee , in the time of the month abib : for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt .
all that openeth the matrix be mine ; and every firstling among thy cattle , whether ox or sheep , that be male .
but the firstling of a ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb : and if thou redeem he not , then shalt thou break he neck .
all the firstborn of thy son thou shalt redeem .
and none shall appear before i empty .
six day thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
and thou shalt observe the feast of week , of the firstfruit of wheat harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the year 's end .
thrice in the year shall all you menchildren appear before the lord god , the god of israel .
for i will cast out the nation before thee , and enlarge thy border : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be leave unto the morning .
the first of the firstfruit of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god .
thou shalt not seethe a kid in he mother 's milk .
and the lord say unto mose , write thou these word : for after the tenor of these word i have make a covenant with thee and with israel .
and he be there with the lord forty day and forty night ; he do neither eat bread , nor drink water .
and he write upon the table the word of the covenant , the ten commandment .
and it come to pass , when moses come down from mount sinai with the two table of testimony in moses ' hand , when he come down from the mount , that mose wist not that the skin of he face shone while he talk with he .
and when aaron and all the child of israel see moses , behold , the skin of he face shone ; and they be afraid to come nigh he .
and moses call unto they ; and aaron and all the ruler of the congregation return unto he : and moses talk with they .
and afterward all the child of israel come nigh : and he give they in commandment all that the lord have speak with he in mount sinai .
and till moses have do speak with they , he put a vail on he face .
but when moses go in before the lord to speak with he , he take the vail off , until he come out .

if the bright spot be white in the skin of he flesh , and in sight be not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turn white ; then the priest shall shut up he that have the plague seven day :
and the priest shall look on he the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague in he sight be at a stay , and the plague spread not in the skin ; then the priest shall shut he up seven day more :
and the priest shall look on he again the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague be somewhat dark , and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pronounce he clean : it be but a scab : and he shall wash he clothes , and be clean .

then the priest shall consider : and , behold , if the leprosy have cover all he flesh , he shall pronounce he clean that have the plague : it be all turn white : he be clean .
but when raw flesh appeareth in he , he shall be unclean .
and the priest shall see the raw flesh , and pronounce he to be unclean : for the raw flesh be unclean : it be a leprosy .
or if the raw flesh turn again , and be change unto white , he shall come unto the priest ;
and the priest shall see he : and , behold , if the plague be turn into white ; then the priest shall pronounce he clean that have the plague : he be clean .

and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the lord .

and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel , or of the stranger that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut he off from among he people .
for the life of the flesh be in the blood : and i have give it to you upon the altar to make a atonement for you soul : for it be the blood that maketh a atonement for the soul .
therefore i say unto the child of israel , no soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood .
and whatsoever man there be of the child of israel , or of the stranger that sojourn among you , which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eat ; he shall even pour out the blood thereof , and cover it with dust .
for it be the life of all flesh ; the blood of it be for the life thereof : therefore i say unto the child of israel , ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh : for the life of all flesh be the blood thereof : whosoever eateth it shall be cut off .
and every soul that eateth that which die of itself , or that which be tear with beast , whether it be one of you own country , or a stranger , he shall both wash he clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even : then shall he be clean .

neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith : neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto : it be confusion .
defile not ye yourselve in any of these thing : for in all these the nation be defile which i cast out before you :

ye shall therefore keep my statute and my judgment , and shall not commit any of these abomination ; neither any of you own nation , nor any stranger that sojourneth among you :
( for all these abomination have the man of the land do , which be before you , and the land be defile ; )

therefore every one that eateth it shall bear he iniquity , because he have profane the hallowed thing of the lord : and that soul shall be cut off from among he people .
and when ye reap the harvest of you land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest .
and thou shalt not glean thy vineyard , neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard ; thou shalt leave they for the poor and stranger : i be the lord you god .

and they put he in ward , that the mind of the lord might be shew they .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,

and he that killeth a beast shall make it good ; beast for beast .

ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger , as for one of you own country : for i be the lord you god .

and the lord speak unto mose in mount sinai , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye come into the land which i give you , then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord .
six year thou shalt sow thy field , and six year thou shalt prune thy vineyard , and gather in the fruit thereof ;
but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the lord : thou shalt neither sow thy field , nor prune thy vineyard .
that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grape of thy vine undress : for it be a year of rest unto the land .
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hire servant , and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee ,
and for thy cattle , and for the beast that be in thy land , shall all the increase thereof be meat .
and thou shalt number seven sabbath of year unto thee , seven time seven year ; and the space of the seven sabbath of year shall be unto thee forty and nine year .
then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all you land .
and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitant thereof : it shall be a jubile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto he possession , and ye shall return every man unto he family .
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grape in it of thy vine undressed .
for it be the jubile ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto he possession .
and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour , or buyest ought of thy neighbour 's hand , ye shall not oppress one another :
accord to the number of year after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour , and accord unto the number of year of the fruit he shall sell unto thee :
accord to the multitude of year thou shalt increase the price thereof , and accord to the fewness of year thou shalt diminish the price of it : for accord to the number of the year of the fruit doth he sell unto thee .
ye shall not therefore oppress one another ; but thou shalt fear thy god : for i be the lord you god .
wherefore ye shall do my statute , and keep my judgment , and do they ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
and the land shall yield she fruit , and ye shall eat you fill , and dwell therein in safety .
and if ye shall say , what shall we eat the seventh year ? behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in we increase :

and ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until she fruit come in ye shall eat of the old store .
the land shall not be sell for ever : for the land be mine ; for ye be stranger and sojourner with i .
and in all the land of you possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land .
if thy brother be waxen poor , and have sell away some of he possession , and if any of he kin come to redeem it , then shall he redeem that which he brother sell .
and if the man have none to redeem it , and himself be able to redeem it ;
then let he count the year of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sell it ; that he may return unto he possession .
but if he be not able to restore it to he , then that which be sell shall remain in the hand of he that have buy it until the year of jubile : and in the jubile it shall go out , and he shall return unto he possession .
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it be sell ; within a full year may he redeem it .
and if it be not redeem within the space of a full year , then the house that be in the walled city shall be establish for ever to he that buy it throughout he generation : it shall not go out in the jubile .
but the house of the village which have no wall round about they shall be count as the field of the country : they may be redeem , and they shall go out in the jubile .
notwithstanding the city of the levites , and the house of the city of they possession , may the levites redeem at any time .
and if a man purchase of the levites , then the house that be sell , and the city of he possession , shall go out in the year of jubile : for the house of the city of the levites be they possession among the child of israel .
but the field of the suburb of they city may not be sell ; for it be they perpetual possession .
and if thy brother be waxen poor , and fall in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve he : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
take thou no usury of he , or increase : but fear thy god ; that thy brother may live with thee .
thou shalt not give he thy money upon usury , nor lend he thy victuals for increase .
i be the lord you god , which bring you forth out of the land of egypt , to give you the land of canaan , and to be you god .
and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor , and be sell unto thee ; thou shalt not compel he to serve as a bondservant :
but as a hire servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile :
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and he child with he , and shall return unto he own family , and unto the possession of he father shall he return .
for they be my servant , which i bring forth out of the land of egypt : they shall not be sell as bondman .
thou shalt not rule over he with rigour ; but shalt fear thy god .
both thy bondmen , and thy bondmaid , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that be round about you ; of they shall ye buy bondman and bondmaid .
moreover of the child of the stranger that do sojourn among you , of they shall ye buy , and of they family that be with you , which they beget in you land : and they shall be you possession .
and ye shall take they as a inheritance for you child after you , to inherit they for a possession ; they shall be you bondman for ever : but over you brethren the child of israel , ye shall not rule one over another with rigour .
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwelleth by he wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger 's family :
after that he be sell he may be redeem again ; one of he brethren may redeem he :
either he uncle , or he uncle 's son , may redeem he , or any that be nigh of kin unto he of he family may redeem he ; or if he be able , he may redeem himself .
and he shall reckon with he that buy he from the year that he be sell to he unto the year of jubile : and the price of he sale shall be accord unto the number of year , accord to the time of a hire servant shall it be with he .
if there be yet many year behind , accord unto they he shall give again the price of he redemption out of the money that he be buy for .
and if there remain but few year unto the year of jubile , then he shall count with he , and accord unto he year shall he give he again the price of he redemption .
and as a yearly hire servant shall he be with he : and the other shall not rule with rigour over he in thy sight .
and if he be not redeem in these year , then he shall go out in the year of jubile , both he , and he child with he .
for unto i the child of israel be servant ; they be my servant whom i bring forth out of the land of egypt : i be the lord you god .
ye shall make you no idol nor graven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in you land , to bow down unto it : for i be the lord you god .
ye shall keep my sabbath , and reverence my sanctuary : i be the lord .
if ye walk in my statute , and keep my commandment , and do they ;
then i will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield she increase , and the tree of the field shall yield they fruit .
and you threshing shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time : and ye shall eat you bread to the full , and dwell in you land safely .
and i will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and i will rid evil beast out of the land , neither shall the sword go through you land .
and ye shall chase you enemy , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
and five of you shall chase a hundred , and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and you enemy shall fall before you by the sword .
for i will have respect unto you , and make you fruitful , and multiply you , and establish my covenant with you .
and ye shall eat old store , and bring forth the old because of the new .
and i will set my tabernacle among you : and my soul shall not abhor you .
and i will walk among you , and will be you god , and ye shall be my people .
i be the lord you god , which bring you forth out of the land of egypt , that ye should not be they bondman ; and i have break the band of you yoke , and make you go upright .
but if ye will not hearken unto i , and will not do all these commandment ;
and if ye shall despise my statute , or if you soul abhor my judgment , so that ye will not do all my commandment , but that ye break my covenant :
i also will do this unto you ; i will even appoint over you terror , consumption , and the burning ague , that shall consume the eye , and cause sorrow of heart : and ye shall sow you seed in vain , for you enemy shall eat it .
and i will set my face against you , and ye shall be slay before you enemy : they that hate you shall reign over you ; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you .
and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto i , then i will punish you seven time more for you sin .
and i will break the pride of you power ; and i will make you heaven as iron , and you earth as brass :
and you strength shall be spend in vain : for you land shall not yield she increase , neither shall the tree of the land yield they fruit .
and if ye walk contrary unto i , and will not hearken unto i ; i will bring seven time more plague upon you accord to you sin .
i will also send wild beast among you , which shall rob you of you child , and destroy you cattle , and make you few in number ; and you high way shall be desolate .
and if ye will not be reform by i by these thing , but will walk contrary unto i ;
then will i also walk contrary unto you , and will punish you yet seven time for you sin .
and i will bring a sword upon you , that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant : and when ye be gather together within you city , i will send the pestilence among you ; and ye shall be deliver into the hand of the enemy .
and when i have break the staff of you bread , ten woman shall bake you bread in one oven , and they shall deliver you you bread again by weight : and ye shall eat , and not be satisfy .
and if ye will not for all this hearken unto i , but walk contrary unto i ;
then i will walk contrary unto you also in fury ; and i , even i , will chastise you seven time for you sin .
and ye shall eat the flesh of you son , and the flesh of you daughter shall ye eat .
and i will destroy you high place , and cut down you image , and cast you carcase upon the carcase of you idol , and my soul shall abhor you .
and i will make you city waste , and bring you sanctuary unto desolation , and i will not smell the savour of you sweet odour .
and i will bring the land into desolation : and you enemy which dwell therein shall be astonish at it .
and i will scatter you among the heathen , and will draw out a sword after you : and you land shall be desolate , and you city waste .
then shall the land enjoy she sabbath , as long as it lieth desolate , and ye be in you enemy ' land ; even then shall the land rest , and enjoy she sabbath .
as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest ; because it do not rest in you sabbath , when ye dwelt upon it .
and upon they that be leave alive of you i will send a faintness into they heart in the land of they enemy ; and the sound of a shake leaf shall chase they ; and they shall flee , as flee from a sword ; and they shall fall when none pursueth .
and they shall fall one upon another , as it be before a sword , when none pursueth : and ye shall have no power to stand before you enemy .
and ye shall perish among the heathen , and the land of you enemy shall eat you up .
and they that be leave of you shall pine away in they iniquity in you enemy ' land ; and also in the iniquity of they father shall they pine away with they .
if they shall confess they iniquity , and the iniquity of they father , with they trespass which they trespass against i , and that also they have walk contrary unto i ;
and that i also have walk contrary unto they , and have bring they into the land of they enemy ; if then they uncircumcised heart be humble , and they then accept of the punishment of they iniquity :
then will i remember my covenant with jacob , and also my covenant with isaac , and also my covenant with abraham will i remember ; and i will remember the land .
the land also shall be leave of they , and shall enjoy she sabbath , while she lieth desolate without they : and they shall accept of the punishment of they iniquity : because , even because they despise my judgment , and because they soul abhor my statute .
and yet for all that , when they be in the land of they enemy , i will not cast they away , neither will i abhor they , to destroy they utterly , and to break my covenant with they : for i be the lord they god .
but i will for they sake remember the covenant of they ancestor , whom i bring forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the heathen , that i might be they god : i be the lord .

both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put they ; that they defile not they camp , in the midst whereof i dwell .
and the child of israel do so , and put they out without the camp : as the lord speak unto mose , so do the child of israel .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , when a man or woman shall commit any sin that man commit , to do a trespass against the lord , and that person be guilty ;
then they shall confess they sin which they have do : and he shall recompense he trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto he against whom he have trespass .
but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto , let the trespass be recompense unto the lord , even to the priest ; beside the ram of the atonement , whereby a atonement shall be make for he .
and every offering of all the holy thing of the child of israel , which they bring unto the priest , shall be he .
and every man 's hallowed thing shall be he : whatsoever any man giveth the priest , it shall be he .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,

and a man lie with she carnally , and it be hide from the eye of she husband , and be keep close , and she be defile , and there be no witness against she , neither she be take with the manner ;
and the spirit of jealousy come upon he , and he be jealous of he wife , and she be defile : or if the spirit of jealousy come upon he , and he be jealous of he wife , and she be not defile :
then shall the man bring he wife unto the priest , and he shall bring she offering for she , the tenth part of a ephah of barley meal ; he shall pour no oil upon it , nor put frankincense thereon ; for it be a offering of jealousy , a offering of memorial , bring iniquity to remembrance .
and the priest shall bring she near , and set she before the lord :
and the priest shall take holy water in a earthen vessel ; and of the dust that be in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put it into the water :
and the priest shall set the woman before the lord , and uncover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in she hand , which be the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in he hand the bitter water that causeth the curse :
and the priest shall charge she by a oath , and say unto the woman , if no man have lie with thee , and if thou hast not go aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse :
but if thou hast go aside to another instead of thy husband , and if thou be defile , and some man have lie with thee beside thine husband :
then the priest shall charge the woman with a oath of cursing , and the priest shall say unto the woman , the lord make thee a curse and a oath among thy people , when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot , and thy belly to swell ;
and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels , to make thy belly to swell , and thy thigh to rot : and the woman shall say , amen , aman .
and the priest shall write these curse in a book , and he shall blot they out with the bitter water :
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into she , and become bitter .
then the priest shall take the jealousy offer out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the lord , and offer it upon the altar :
and the priest shall take a handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .

and if the woman be not defile , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .

this be the law of the nazarite who have vow , and of he offering unto the lord for he separation , beside that that he hand shall get : accord to the vow which he vow , so he must do after the law of he separation .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto aaron and unto he son , say , on this wise ye shall bless the child of israel , say unto they ,
the lord bless thee , and keep thee :
the lord make he face shine upon thee , and be gracious unto thee :
the lord lift up he countenance upon thee , and give thee peace .
and they shall put my name upon the child of israel ; and i will bless they .

and they depart from the mount of the lord three day ' journey : and the ark of the covenant of the lord go before they in the three day ' journey , to search out a rest place for they .
and the cloud of the lord be upon they by day , when they go out of the camp .
and it come to pass , when the ark set forward , that moses say , rise up , lord , and let thine enemy be scatter ; and let they that hate thee flee before thee .
and when it rest , he say , return , o lord , unto the many thousand of israel .
and when the people complain , it displeased the lord : and the lord hear it ; and he anger be kindle ; and the fire of the lord burn among they , and consume they that be in the uttermost part of the camp .
and the people cry unto mose ; and when moses pray unto the lord , the fire be quench .
and he call the name of the place taberah : because the fire of the lord burn among they .
and the mixt multitude that be among they fall a lusting : and the child of israel also weep again , and say , who shall give we flesh to eat ?
we remember the fish , which we do eat in egypt freely ; the cucumber , and the melon , and the leek , and the onion , and the garlick :
but now we soul be dry away : there be nothing at all , beside this manna , before we eye .
and the manna be as coriander seed , and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium .
and the people go about , and gather it , and ground it in mill , or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in pan , and make cake of it : and the taste of it be as the taste of fresh oil .
and when the dew fall upon the camp in the night , the manna fall upon it .
then moses hear the people weep throughout they family , every man in the door of he tent : and the anger of the lord be kindle greatly ; moses also be displeased .
and moses say unto the lord , wherefore hast thou afflict thy servant ? and wherefore have i not find favour in thy sight , that thou layest the burden of all this people upon i ?
have i conceive all this people ? have i beget they , that thou shouldest say unto i , carry they in thy bosom , as a nursing father beareth the suck child , unto the land which thou swarest unto they father ?
whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people ? for they weep unto i , say , give we flesh , that we may eat .
i be not able to bear all this people alone , because it be too heavy for i .
and if thou deal thus with i , kill i , i pray thee , out of hand , if i have find favour in thy sight ; and let i not see my wretchedness .
and the lord say unto mose , gather unto i seventy man of the elder of israel , whom thou knowest to be the elder of the people , and officer over they ; and bring they unto the tabernacle of the congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
and i will come down and talk with thee there : and i will take of the spirit which be upon thee , and will put it upon they ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thyself alone .
and say thou unto the people , sanctify yourselve against to morrow , and ye shall eat flesh : for ye have weep in the ear of the lord , say , who shall give we flesh to eat ? for it be well with we in egypt : therefore the lord will give you flesh , and ye shall eat .
ye shall not eat one day , nor two day , nor five day , neither ten day , nor twenty day ;
but even a whole month , until it come out at you nostril , and it be loathsome unto you : because that ye have despise the lord which be among you , and have weep before he , say , why come we forth out of egypt ?
and moses say , the people , among whom i be , be six hundred thousand footman ; and thou hast say , i will give they flesh , that they may eat a whole month .
shall the flock and the herd be slay for they , to suffice they ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gather together for they , to suffice they ?
and the lord say unto mose , be the lord 's hand wax short ? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not .
and moses go out , and tell the people the word of the lord , and gather the seventy man of the elder of the people , and set they round about the tabernacle .
and the lord come down in a cloud , and spake unto he , and take of the spirit that be upon he , and give it unto the seventy elder : and it come to pass , that , when the spirit rest upon they , they prophesy , and do not cease .
but there remain two of the man in the camp , the name of the one be eldad , and the name of the other medad : and the spirit rest upon they ; and they be of they that be write , but go not out unto the tabernacle : and they prophesy in the camp .
and there run a young man , and tell moses , and say , eldad and medad do prophesy in the camp .
and joshua the son of nun , the servant of moses , one of he young man , answer and say , my lord moses , forbid they .
and moses say unto he , enviest thou for my sake ? would god that all the lord 's people be prophet , and that the lord would put he spirit upon they !
and moses gat he into the camp , he and the elder of israel .
and there go forth a wind from the lord , and bring quail from the sea , and let they fall by the camp , as it be a day 's journey on this side , and as it be a day 's journey on the other side , round about the camp , and as it be two cubit high upon the face of the earth .
and the people stand up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gather the quail : he that gather least gather ten homer : and they spread they all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and while the flesh be yet between they tooth , ere it be chew , the wrath of the lord be kindle against the people , and the lord smite the people with a very great plague .
and he call the name of that place kibrothhattaavah : because there they bury the people that lust .
and the people journey from kibrothhattaavah unto hazeroth ; and abode at hazeroth .
and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he have marry : for he have marry a ethiopian woman .
and they say , have the lord indeed speak only by moses ? have he not speak also by we ?
and the lord hear it .
( now the man moses be very meek , above all the man which be upon the face of the earth . )
and the lord spake suddenly unto moses , and unto aaron , and unto miriam , come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation .
and they three come out .
and the lord come down in the pillar of the cloud , and stand in the door of the tabernacle , and call aaron and miriam : and they both come forth .
and he say , hear now my word : if there be a prophet among you , i the lord will make myself know unto he in a vision , and will speak unto he in a dream .
my servant moses be not so , who be faithful in all mine house .
with he will i speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speech ; and the similitude of the lord shall he behold : wherefore then be ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses ?
and the anger of the lord be kindle against they ; and he depart .
and the cloud depart from off the tabernacle ; and , behold , miriam become leprous , white as snow : and aaron look upon miriam , and , behold , she be leprous .
and aaron say unto mose , alas , my lord , i beseech thee , lay not the sin upon we , wherein we have do foolishly , and wherein we have sin .
let she not be as one dead , of whom the flesh be half consume when he cometh out of he mother 's womb .
and moses cry unto the lord , say , heal she now , o god , i beseech thee .
and the lord say unto mose , if she father have but spit in she face , should she not be ashamed seven day ? let she be shut out from the camp seven day , and after that let she be receive in again .
and miriam be shut out from the camp seven day : and the people journey not till miriam be bring in again .
and afterward the people remove from hazeroth , and pitch in the wilderness of paran .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
send thou man , that they may search the land of canaan , which i give unto the child of israel : of every tribe of they father shall ye send a man , every one a ruler among they .
and moses by the commandment of the lord send they from the wilderness of paran : all those man be head of the child of israel .
and these be they name : of the tribe of reuben , shammua the son of zaccur .
of the tribe of simeon , shaphat the son of hori .
of the tribe of judah , caleb the son of jephunneh .
of the tribe of issachar , igal the son of joseph .
of the tribe of ephraim , oshea the son of nun .
of the tribe of benjamin , palti the son of raphu .
of the tribe of zebulun , gaddiel the son of sodi .
of the tribe of joseph , namely , of the tribe of manasseh , gaddi the son of susi .
of the tribe of dan , ammiel the son of gemalli .
of the tribe of asher , sethur the son of michael .
of the tribe of naphtali , nahbi the son of vophsus .
of the tribe of gad , geuel the son of machi .
these be the name of the man which moses send to spy out the land .
and moses call oshea the son of nun jehoshua .
and moses send they to spy out the land of canaan , and say unto they , get you up this way southward , and go up into the mountain :
and see the land , what it be ; and the people that dwelleth therein , whether they be strong or weak , few or many ;
and what the land be that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad ; and what city they be that they dwell in , whether in tent , or in strong hold ;
and what the land be , whether it be fat or lean , whether there be wood therein , or not .
and be ye of good courage , and bring of the fruit of the land .
now the time be the time of the firstripe grape .
so they go up , and search the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob , as man come to hamath .
and they ascend by the south , and come unto hebron ; where ahiman , sheshai , and talmai , the child of anak , be .
( now hebron be build seven year before zoan in egypt . )
and they come unto the brook of eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grape , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they bring of the pomegranate , and of the fig .
the place be call the brook eshcol , because of the cluster of grape which the child of israel cut down from thence .
and they return from search of the land after forty day .
and they go and come to moses , and to aaron , and to all the congregation of the child of israel , unto the wilderness of paran , to kadesh ; and bring back word unto they , and unto all the congregation , and shew they the fruit of the land .
and they tell he , and say , we come unto the land whither thou sentest we , and surely it floweth with milk and honey ; and this be the fruit of it .
nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land , and the city be wall , and very great : and moreover we see the child of anak there .
the amalekites dwell in the land of the south : and the hittites , and the jebusites , and the amorites , dwell in the mountain : and the canaanites dwell by the sea , and by the coast of jordan .
and caleb still the people before mose , and say , let we go up at once , and possess it ; for we be well able to overcome it .
but the man that go up with he say , we be not able to go up against the people ; for they be stronger than we .
and they bring up a evil report of the land which they have search unto the child of israel , say , the land , through which we have go to search it , be a land that eateth up the inhabitant thereof ; and all the people that we see in it be man of a great stature .
and there we see the giant , the son of anak , which come of the giant : and we be in we own sight as grasshopper , and so we be in they sight .
and all the congregation lift up they voice , and cry ; and the people weep that night .
and all the child of israel murmur against moses and against aaron : and the whole congregation say unto they , would god that we have die in the land of egypt ! or would god we have die in this wilderness !
and wherefore have the lord bring we unto this land , to fall by the sword , that we wife and we child should be a prey ? be it not better for we to return into egypt ?
and they say one to another , let we make a captain , and let we return into egypt .
then moses and aaron fall on they face before all the assembly of the congregation of the child of israel .
and joshua the son of nun , and caleb the son of jephunneh , which be of they that search the land , rent they clothes :
and they speak unto all the company of the child of israel , say , the land , which we pass through to search it , be a exceed good land .
if the lord delight in we , then he will bring we into this land , and give it we ; a land which floweth with milk and honey .
only rebel not ye against the lord , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they be bread for we : they defence be depart from they , and the lord be with we : fear they not .
but all the congregation bid stone they with stone .
and the glory of the lord appear in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the child of israel .
and the lord say unto mose , how long will this people provoke i ? and how long will it be ere they believe i , for all the sign which i have shew among they ?
i will smite they with the pestilence , and disinherit they , and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they .
and moses say unto the lord , then the egyptians shall hear it , ( for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among they ; )
and they will tell it to the inhabitant of this land : for they have hear that thou lord art among this people , that thou lord art see face to face , and that thy cloud standeth over they , and that thou goest before they , by day time in a pillar of a cloud , and in a pillar of fire by night .
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nation which have hear the fame of thee will speak , say ,
because the lord be not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto they , therefore he have slay they in the wilderness .
and now , i beseech thee , let the power of my lord be great , accord as thou hast speak , say ,
the lord be longsuffer , and of great mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression , and by no means clear the guilty , visit the iniquity of the father upon the child unto the third and fourth generation .
pardon , i beseech thee , the iniquity of this people accord unto the greatness of thy mercy , and as thou hast forgive this people , from egypt even until now .
and the lord say , i have pardon accord to thy word :
but as truly as i live , all the earth shall be fill with the glory of the lord .
because all those man which have see my glory , and my miracle , which i do in egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempt i now these ten time , and have not hearken to my voice ;
surely they shall not see the land which i sware unto they father , neither shall any of they that provoke i see it :
but my servant caleb , because he have another spirit with he , and have follow i fully , he will i bring into the land whereinto he go ; and he seed shall possess it .
( now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valley . )
tomorrow turn you , and get you into the wilderness by the way of the red sea .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
how long shall i bear with this evil congregation , which murmur against i ?
i have hear the murmuring of the child of israel , which they murmur against i .
say unto they , as truly as i live , saith the lord , as ye have speak in mine ear , so will i do to you :
you carcase shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that be number of you , accord to you whole number , from twenty year old and upward , which have murmur against i ,
doubtless ye shall not come into the land , concern which i sware to make you dwell therein , save caleb the son of jephunneh , and joshua the son of nun .
but you little one , which ye say should be a prey , they will i bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have despise .
but as for you , you carcase , they shall fall in this wilderness .
and you child shall wander in the wilderness forty year , and bear you whoredom , until you carcase be waste in the wilderness .
after the number of the day in which ye search the land , even forty day , each day for a year , shall ye bear you iniquity , even forty year , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
i the lord have say , i will surely do it unto all this evil congregation , that be gather together against i : in this wilderness they shall be consume , and there they shall die .
and the man , which moses send to search the land , who return , and make all the congregation to murmur against he , by bring up a slander upon the land ,
even those man that do bring up the evil report upon the land , die by the plague before the lord .
but joshua the son of nun , and caleb the son of jephunneh , which be of the man that go to search the land , live still .
and moses tell these saying unto all the child of israel : and the people mourn greatly .
and they rise up early in the morning , and gat they up into the top of the mountain , say , lo , we be here , and will go up unto the place which the lord have promise : for we have sin .
and moses say , wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the lord ? but it shall not prosper .
go not up , for the lord be not among you ; that ye be not smite before you enemy .
for the amalekites and the canaanites be there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword : because ye be turn away from the lord , therefore the lord will not be with you .
but they presume to go up unto the hill top : nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the lord , and moses , depart not out of the camp .
then the amalekites come down , and the canaanites which dwell in that hill , and smite they , and discomfited they , even unto hormah .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye be come into the land of you habitation , which i give unto you ,
and will make a offering by fire unto the lord , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice in perform a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in you solemn feast , to make a sweet savour unto the lord , of the herd , or of the flock :
then shall he that offereth he offering unto the lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingle with the fourth part of a hin of oil .
and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice , for one lamb .
or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offer two tenth deal of flour mingle with the third part of a hin of oil .
and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine , for a sweet savour unto the lord .
and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in perform a vow , or peace offering unto the lord :
then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deal of flour mingle with half a hin of oil .
and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half a hin of wine , for a offering make by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
thus shall it be do for one bullock , or for one ram , or for a lamb , or a kid .
accord to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do to every one accord to they number .
all that be bear of the country shall do these thing after this manner , in offer a offering make by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
and if a stranger sojourn with you , or whosoever be among you in you generation , and will offer a offering make by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord ; as ye do , so he shall do .
one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation , and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you , a ordinance for ever in you generation : as ye be , so shall the stranger be before the lord .
one law and one manner shall be for you , and for the stranger that sojourneth with you .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye come into the land whither i bring you ,
then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up a heave offering unto the lord .
ye shall offer up a cake of the first of you dough for a heave offering : as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor , so shall ye heave it .
of the first of you dough ye shall give unto the lord a heave offering in you generation .
and if ye have err , and not observe all these commandment , which the lord have speak unto mose ,
even all that the lord have command you by the hand of moses , from the day that the lord command moses , and henceforward among you generation ;
then it shall be , if ought be commit by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation , that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour unto the lord , with he meat offering , and he drink offering , accord to the manner , and one kid of the goat for a sin offering .
and the priest shall make a atonement for all the congregation of the child of israel , and it shall be forgive they ; for it be ignorance : and they shall bring they offering , a sacrifice make by fire unto the lord , and they sin offering before the lord , for they ignorance :
and it shall be forgive all the congregation of the child of israel , and the stranger that sojourneth among they ; see all the people be in ignorance .
and if any soul sin through ignorance , then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering .
and the priest shall make a atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord , to make a atonement for he ; and it shall be forgive he .
ye shall have one law for he that sinneth through ignorance , both for he that be bear among the child of israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among they .
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be bear in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from among he people .
because he have despise the word of the lord , and have break he commandment , that soul shall utterly be cut off ; he iniquity shall be upon he .
and while the child of israel be in the wilderness , they find a man that gather stick upon the sabbath day .
and they that find he gather stick bring he unto mose and aaron , and unto all the congregation .
and they put he in ward , because it be not declare what should be do to he .
and the lord say unto mose , the man shall be surely put to death : all the congregation shall stone he with stone without the camp .
and all the congregation bring he without the camp , and stone he with stone , and he die ; as the lord command moses .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and bid they that they make they fringe in the border of they garment throughout they generation , and that they put upon the fringe of the border a ribband of blue :
and it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the commandment of the lord , and do they ; and that ye seek not after you own heart and you own eye , after which ye use to go a whoring :
that ye may remember , and do all my commandment , and be holy unto you god .
i be the lord you god , which bring you out of the land of egypt , to be you god : i be the lord you god .
now korah , the son of izhar , the son of kohath , the son of levi , and dathan and abiram , the son of eliab , and on , the son of peleth , son of reuben , take man :
and they rise up before moses , with certain of the child of israel , two hundred and fifty prince of the assembly , famous in the congregation , man of renown :
and they gather themselves together against moses and against aaron , and say unto they , ye take too much upon you , see all the congregation be holy , every one of they , and the lord be among they : wherefore then lift ye up yourselve above the congregation of the lord ?
and when moses hear it , he fall upon he face :
and he speak unto korah and unto all he company , say , even to morrow the lord will shew who be he , and who be holy ; and will cause he to come near unto he : even he whom he have choose will he cause to come near unto he .
this do ; take you censer , korah , and all he company ;
and put fire therein , and put incense in they before the lord to morrow : and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose , he shall be holy : ye take too much upon you , ye son of levi .
and moses say unto korah , hear , i pray you , ye son of levi :
seemeth it but a small thing unto you , that the god of israel have separate you from the congregation of israel , to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto they ?
and he have bring thee near to he , and all thy brethren the son of levi with thee : and seek ye the priesthood also ?
for which cause both thou and all thy company be gather together against the lord : and what be aaron , that ye murmur against he ?
and moses send to call dathan and abiram , the son of eliab : which say , we will not come up :
be it a small thing that thou hast bring we up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill we in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over we ?
moreover thou hast not bring we into a land that floweth with milk and honey , or give we inheritance of field and vineyard : wilt thou put out the eye of these man ? we will not come up .
and moses be very wroth , and say unto the lord , respect not thou they offering : i have not take one ass from they , neither have i hurt one of they .
and moses say unto korah , be thou and all thy company before the lord , thou , and they , and aaron , to morrow :
and take every man he censer , and put incense in they , and bring ye before the lord every man he censer , two hundred and fifty censer ; thou also , and aaron , each of you he censer .
and they take every man he censer , and put fire in they , and lay incense thereon , and stand in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with mose and aaron .
and korah gather all the congregation against they unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and the glory of the lord appear unto all the congregation .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
separate yourselve from among this congregation , that i may consume they in a moment .
and they fall upon they face , and say , o god , the god of the spirit of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation ?
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the congregation , say , get you up from about the tabernacle of korah , dathan , and abiram .
and moses rise up and go unto dathan and abiram ; and the elder of israel follow he .
and he speak unto the congregation , say , depart , i pray you , from the tent of these wicked man , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consume in all they sin .
so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah , dathan , and abiram , on every side : and dathan and abiram come out , and stand in the door of they tent , and they wife , and they son , and they little child .
and moses say , hereby ye shall know that the lord have send i to do all these work ; for i have not do they of mine own mind .
if these man die the common death of all man , or if they be visit after the visitation of all man ; then the lord have not send i .
but if the lord make a new thing , and the earth open she mouth , and swallow they up , with all that appertain unto they , and they go down quick into the pit ; then ye shall understand that these man have provoke the lord .
and it come to pass , as he have make a end of speak all these word , that the ground clave asunder that be under they :
and the earth open she mouth , and swallow they up , and they house , and all the man that appertain unto korah , and all they goods .
they , and all that appertain to they , go down alive into the pit , and the earth close upon they : and they perish from among the congregation .
and all israel that be round about they flee at the cry of they : for they say , lest the earth swallow we up also .
and there come out a fire from the lord , and consume the two hundred and fifty man that offer incense .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest , that he take up the censer out of the burning , and scatter thou the fire yonder ; for they be hallowed .
the censer of these sinner against they own soul , let they make they broad plate for a covering of the altar : for they offer they before the lord , therefore they be hallowed : and they shall be a sign unto the child of israel .
and eleazar the priest take the brasen censer , wherewith they that be burn have offer ; and they be make broad plate for a covering of the altar :
to be a memorial unto the child of israel , that no stranger , which be not of the seed of aaron , come near to offer incense before the lord ; that he be not as korah , and as he company : as the lord say to he by the hand of moses .
but on the morrow all the congregation of the child of israel murmur against moses and against aaron , say , ye have kill the people of the lord .
and it come to pass , when the congregation be gather against moses and against aaron , that they look toward the tabernacle of the congregation : and , behold , the cloud cover it , and the glory of the lord appear .
and moses and aaron come before the tabernacle of the congregation .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
get you up from among this congregation , that i may consume they as in a moment .
and they fall upon they face .
and moses say unto aaron , take a censer , and put fire therein from off the altar , and put on incense , and go quickly unto the congregation , and make a atonement for they : for there be wrath go out from the lord ; the plague be begin .
and aaron take as moses command , and run into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague be begin among the people : and he put on incense , and make a atonement for the people .
and he stand between the dead and the living ; and the plague be stay .
now they that die in the plague be fourteen thousand and seven hundred , beside they that die about the matter of korah .
and aaron return unto mose unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and the plague be stay .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and take of every one of they a rod accord to the house of they father , of all they prince accord to the house of they father twelve rod : write thou every man 's name upon he rod .
and thou shalt write aaron 's name upon the rod of levi : for one rod shall be for the head of the house of they father .
and thou shalt lay they up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony , where i will meet with you .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's rod , whom i shall choose , shall blossom : and i will make to cease from i the murmuring of the child of israel , whereby they murmur against you .
and moses spake unto the child of israel , and every one of they prince give he a rod apiece , for each prince one , accord to they father ' house , even twelve rod : and the rod of aaron be among they rod .
and moses lay up the rod before the lord in the tabernacle of witness .
and it come to pass , that on the morrow moses go into the tabernacle of witness ; and , behold , the rod of aaron for the house of levi be bud , and bring forth bud , and bloom blossom , and yield almond .
and moses bring out all the rod from before the lord unto all the child of israel : and they look , and take every man he rod .
and the lord say unto mose , bring aaron 's rod again before the testimony , to be keep for a token against the rebel ; and thou shalt quite take away they murmuring from i , that they die not .
and moses do so : as the lord command he , so do he .
and the child of israel spake unto moses , say , behold , we die , we perish , we all perish .
whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord shall die : shall we be consume with die ?
and the lord say unto aaron , thou and thy son and thy father 's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary : and thou and thy son with thee shall bear the iniquity of you priesthood .
and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be join unto thee , and minister unto thee : but thou and thy son with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness .
and they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessel of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and they shall be join unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , for all the service of the tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you .
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary , and the charge of the altar : that there be no wrath any more upon the child of israel .
and i , behold , i have take you brethren the levites from among the child of israel : to you they be give as a gift for the lord , to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
therefore thou and thy son with thee shall keep you priest 's office for everything of the altar , and within the vail ; and ye shall serve : i have give you priest 's office unto you as a service of gift : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
and the lord spake unto aaron , behold , i also have give thee the charge of mine heave offering of all the hallowed thing of the child of israel ; unto thee have i give they by reason of the anointing , and to thy son , by a ordinance for ever .
this shall be thine of the most holy thing , reserve from the fire : every oblation of theirs , every meat offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto i , shall be most holy for thee and for thy son .
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it ; every male shall eat it : it shall be holy unto thee .
and this be thine ; the heave offering of they gift , with all the wave offering of the child of israel : i have give they unto thee , and to thy son and to thy daughter with thee , by a statute for ever : every one that be clean in thy house shall eat of it .
all the best of the oil , and all the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the firstfruit of they which they shall offer unto the lord , they have i give thee .
and whatsoever be first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the lord , shall be thine ; every one that be clean in thine house shall eat of it .
every thing devote in israel shall be thine .
every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh , which they bring unto the lord , whether it be of man or beast , shall be thine : nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem , and the firstling of unclean beast shalt thou redeem .
and those that be to be redeem from a month old shalt thou redeem , accord to thine estimation , for the money of five shekel , after the shekel of the sanctuary , which be twenty gerah .
but the firstling of a cow , or the firstling of a sheep , or the firstling of a goat , thou shalt not redeem ; they be holy : thou shalt sprinkle they blood upon the altar , and shalt burn they fat for a offering make by fire , for a sweet savour unto the lord .
and the flesh of they shall be thine , as the wave breast and as the right shoulder be thine .
all the heave offering of the holy thing , which the child of israel offer unto the lord , have i give thee , and thy son and thy daughter with thee , by a statute for ever : it be a covenant of salt for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee .
and the lord spake unto aaron , thou shalt have no inheritance in they land , neither shalt thou have any part among they : i be thy part and thine inheritance among the child of israel .
and , behold , i have give the child of levi all the tenth in israel for a inheritance , for they service which they serve , even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
neither must the child of israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation , lest they bear sin , and die .
but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they shall bear they iniquity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout you generation , that among the child of israel they have no inheritance .
but the tithe of the child of israel , which they offer as a heave offering unto the lord , i have give to the levites to inherit : therefore i have say unto they , among the child of israel they shall have no inheritance .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
thus speak unto the levites , and say unto they , when ye take of the child of israel the tithe which i have give you from they for you inheritance , then ye shall offer up a heave offering of it for the lord , even a tenth part of the tithe .
and this you heave offering shall be reckon unto you , as though it be the corn of the threshingfloor , and as the fulness of the winepress .
thus ye also shall offer a heave offering unto the lord of all you tithe , which ye receive of the child of israel ; and ye shall give thereof the lord 's heave offering to aaron the priest .
out of all you gift ye shall offer every heave offering of the lord , of all the best thereof , even the hallowed part thereof out of it .
therefore thou shalt say unto they , when ye have heave the best thereof from it , then it shall be count unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor , and as the increase of the winepress .
and ye shall eat it in every place , ye and you household : for it be you reward for you service in the tabernacle of the congregation .
and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it , when ye have heave from it the best of it : neither shall ye pollute the holy thing of the child of israel , lest ye die .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
this be the ordinance of the law which the lord have command , say , speak unto the child of israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without spot , wherein be no blemish , and upon which never come yoke :
and ye shall give she unto eleazar the priest , that he may bring she forth without the camp , and one shall slay she before he face :
and eleazar the priest shall take of she blood with he finger , and sprinkle of she blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven time :
and one shall burn the heifer in he sight ; she skin , and she flesh , and she blood , with she dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash he clothes , and he shall bathe he flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and he that burneth she shall wash he clothes in water , and bathe he flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the even .
and a man that be clean shall gather up the ash of the heifer , and lay they up without the camp in a clean place , and it shall be keep for the congregation of the child of israel for a water of separation : it be a purification for sin .
and he that gathereth the ash of the heifer shall wash he clothes , and be unclean until the even : and it shall be unto the child of israel , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among they , for a statute for ever .
he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven day .
he shall purify himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he purify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that be dead , and purifieth not himself , defileth the tabernacle of the lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from israel : because the water of separation be not sprinkle upon he , he shall be unclean ; he uncleanness be yet upon he .
this be the law , when a man dieth in a tent : all that come into the tent , and all that be in the tent , shall be unclean seven day .
and every open vessel , which have no cover bind upon it , be unclean .
and whosoever toucheth one that be slay with a sword in the open field , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven day .
and for a unclean person they shall take of the ash of the burnt heifer of purification for sin , and run water shall be put thereto in a vessel :
and a clean person shall take hyssop , and dip it in the water , and sprinkle it upon the tent , and upon all the vessel , and upon the person that be there , and upon he that touch a bone , or one slay , or one dead , or a grave :
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify himself , and wash he clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
but the man that shall be unclean , and shall not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation , because he have defile the sanctuary of the lord : the water of separation have not be sprinkle upon he ; he be unclean .
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto they , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash he clothes ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even .
and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean ; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even .
then come the child of israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of zin in the first month : and the people abide in kadesh ; and miriam die there , and be bury there .
and there be no water for the congregation : and they gather themselves together against moses and against aaron .
and the people chode with mose , and spake , say , would god that we have die when we brethren die before the lord !
and why have ye bring up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness , that we and we cattle should die there ?
and wherefore have ye make we to come up out of egypt , to bring we in unto this evil place ? it be no place of seed , or of fig , or of vine , or of pomegranate ; neither be there any water to drink .
and moses and aaron go from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they fall upon they face : and the glory of the lord appear unto they .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
take the rod , and gather thou the assembly together , thou , and aaron thy brother , and speak ye unto the rock before they eye ; and it shall give forth he water , and thou shalt bring forth to they water out of the rock : so thou shalt give the congregation and they beast drink .
and moses take the rod from before the lord , as he command he .
and moses and aaron gather the congregation together before the rock , and he say unto they , hear now , ye rebel ; must we fetch you water out of this rock ?
and mose lift up he hand , and with he rod he smite the rock twice : and the water come out abundantly , and the congregation drink , and they beast also .
and the lord speak unto mose and aaron , because ye believe i not , to sanctify i in the eye of the child of israel , therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have give they .
this be the water of meribah ; because the child of israel strive with the lord , and he be sanctify in they .
and moses send messenger from kadesh unto the king of edom , thus saith thy brother israel , thou knowest all the travail that have befall we :
how we father go down into egypt , and we have dwell in egypt a long time ; and the egyptians vex we , and we father :
and when we cry unto the lord , he hear we voice , and send a angel , and have bring we forth out of egypt : and , behold , we be in kadesh , a city in the uttermost of thy border :
let we pass , i pray thee , through thy country : we will not pass through the field , or through the vineyard , neither will we drink of the water of the well : we will go by the king 's high way , we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left , until we have pass thy border .
and edom say unto he , thou shalt not pass by i , lest i come out against thee with the sword .
and the child of israel say unto he , we will go by the high way : and if i and my cattle drink of thy water , then i will pay for it : i will only , without do anything else , go through on my foot .
and he say , thou shalt not go through .
and edom come out against he with much people , and with a strong hand .
thus edom refuse to give israel passage through he border : wherefore israel turn away from he .
and the child of israel , even the whole congregation , journey from kadesh , and come unto mount hor .
and the lord speak unto mose and aaron in mount hor , by the coast of the land of edom , say ,
aaron shall be gather unto he people : for he shall not enter into the land which i have give unto the child of israel , because ye rebel against my word at the water of meribah .
take aaron and eleazar he son , and bring they up unto mount hor :
and strip aaron of he garment , and put they upon eleazar he son : and aaron shall be gather unto he people , and shall die there .
and moses do as the lord command : and they go up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation .
and moses strip aaron of he garment , and put they upon eleazar he son ; and aaron die there in the top of the mount : and moses and eleazar come down from the mount .
and when all the congregation see that aaron be dead , they mourn for aaron thirty day , even all the house of israel .
and when king arad the canaanite , which dwell in the south , hear tell that israel come by the way of the spy ; then he fight against israel , and take some of they prisoner .
and israel vow a vow unto the lord , and say , if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand , then i will utterly destroy they city .
and the lord hearken to the voice of israel , and deliver up the canaanites ; and they utterly destroy they and they city : and he call the name of the place hormah .
and they journey from mount hor by the way of the red sea , to compass the land of edom : and the soul of the people be much discourage because of the way .
and the people speak against god , and against moses , wherefore have ye bring we up out of egypt to die in the wilderness ? for there be no bread , neither be there any water ; and we soul loatheth this light bread .
and the lord send fiery serpent among the people , and they bite the people ; and much people of israel die .
therefore the people come to moses , and say , we have sin , for we have speak against the lord , and against thee ; pray unto the lord , that he take away the serpent from we .
and moses pray for the people .
and the lord say unto moses , make thee a fiery serpent , and set it upon a pole : and it shall come to pass , that every one that be bite , when he looketh upon it , shall live .
and moses make a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole , and it come to pass , that if a serpent have bite any man , when he behold the serpent of brass , he live .
and the child of israel set forward , and pitch in oboth .
and they journey from oboth , and pitch at ijeabarim , in the wilderness which be before moab , toward the sunrising .
from thence they remove , and pitch in the valley of zared .
from thence they remove , and pitch on the other side of arnon , which be in the wilderness that cometh out of the coast of the amorites : for arnon be the border of moab , between moab and the amorites .
wherefore it be say in the book of the war of the lord , what he do in the red sea , and in the brook of arnon ,
and at the stream of the brook that goeth down to the dwelling of ar , and lieth upon the border of moab .
and from thence they go to beer : that be the well whereof the lord speak unto mose , gather the people together , and i will give they water .
then israel sing this song , spring up , o well ; sing ye unto it :
the prince dig the well , the noble of the people dig it , by the direction of the lawgiver , with they stave .
and from the wilderness they go to mattanah :
and from mattanah to nahaliel : and from nahaliel to bamoth :
and from bamoth in the valley , that be in the country of moab , to the top of pisgah , which looketh toward jeshimon .
and israel send messenger unto sihon king of the amorites , say ,
let i pass through thy land : we will not turn into the field , or into the vineyard ; we will not drink of the water of the well : but we will go along by the king 's high way , until we be past thy border .
and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through he border : but sihon gather all he people together , and go out against israel into the wilderness : and he come to jahaz , and fight against israel .
and israel smite he with the edge of the sword , and possess he land from arnon unto jabbok , even unto the child of ammon : for the border of the child of ammon be strong .
and israel take all these city : and israel dwelt in all the city of the amorites , in heshbon , and in all the village thereof .
for heshbon be the city of sihon the king of the amorites , who have fight against the former king of moab , and take all he land out of he hand , even unto arnon .
wherefore they that speak in proverb say , come into heshbon , let the city of sihon be build and prepare :
for there be a fire go out of heshbon , a flame from the city of sihon : it have consume ar of moab , and the lord of the high place of arnon .
woe to thee , moab ! thou art undo , o people of chemosh : he have give he son that escape , and he daughter , into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites .
we have shoot at they ; heshbon be perish even unto dibon , and we have lay they waste even unto nophah , which reacheth unto medeba .
thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites .
and moses send to spy out jaazer , and they take the village thereof , and drive out the amorites that be there .
and they turn and go up by the way of bashan : and og the king of bashan go out against they , he , and all he people , to the battle at edrei .
and the lord say unto mose , fear he not : for i have deliver he into thy hand , and all he people , and he land ; and thou shalt do to he as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites , which dwell at heshbon .
so they smite he , and he son , and all he people , until there be none leave he alive : and they possess he land .
and the child of israel set forward , and pitch in the plain of moab on this side jordan by jericho .
and balak the son of zippor see all that israel have do to the amorites .
and moab be sore afraid of the people , because they be many : and moab be distressed because of the child of israel .
and moab say unto the elder of midian , now shall this company lick up all that be round about we , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field .
and balak the son of zippor be king of the moabite at that time .
he send messenger therefore unto balaam the son of beor to pethor , which be by the river of the land of the child of he people , to call he , say , behold , there be a people come out from egypt : behold , they cover the face of the earth , and they abide over against i :
come now therefore , i pray thee , curse i this people ; for they be too mighty for i : peradventure i shall prevail , that we may smite they , and that i may drive they out of the land : for i wot that he whom thou blessest be bless , and he whom thou cursest be curse .
and the elder of moab and the elder of midian depart with the reward of divination in they hand ; and they come unto balaam , and spake unto he the word of balak .
and he say unto they , lodge here this night , and i will bring you word again , as the lord shall speak unto i : and the prince of moab abode with balaam .
and god come unto balaam , and say , what man be these with thee ?
and balaam say unto god , balak the son of zippor , king of moab , have send unto i , say ,
behold , there be a people come out of egypt , which covereth the face of the earth : come now , curse i they ; peradventure i shall be able to overcome they , and drive they out .
and god say unto balaam , thou shalt not go with they ; thou shalt not curse the people : for they be bless .
and balaam rise up in the morning , and say unto the prince of balak , get you into you land : for the lord refuseth to give i leave to go with you .
and the prince of moab rise up , and they go unto balak , and say , balaam refuseth to come with we .
and balak send yet again prince , more , and more honourable than they .
and they come to balaam , and say to he , thus saith balak the son of zippor , let nothing , i pray thee , hinder thee from come unto i :
for i will promote thee unto very great honour , and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto i : come therefore , i pray thee , curse i this people .
and balaam answer and say unto the servant of balak , if balak would give i he house full of silver and gold , i can not go beyond the word of the lord my god , to do less or more .
now therefore , i pray you , tarry ye also here this night , that i may know what the lord will say unto i more .
and god come unto balaam at night , and say unto he , if the man come to call thee , rise up , and go with they ; but yet the word which i shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
and balaam rise up in the morning , and saddle he ass , and go with the prince of moab .
and god 's anger be kindle because he go : and the angel of the lord stand in the way for a adversary against he .
now he be ride upon he ass , and he two servant be with he .
and the ass see the angel of the lord standing in the way , and he sword draw in he hand : and the ass turn aside out of the way , and go into the field : and balaam smite the ass , to turn she into the way .
but the angel of the lord stand in a path of the vineyard , a wall be on this side , and a wall on that side .
and when the ass see the angel of the lord , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed balaam 's foot against the wall : and he smite she again .
and the angel of the lord go further , and stand in a narrow place , where be no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass see the angel of the lord , she fall down under balaam : and balaam 's anger be kindle , and he smite the ass with a staff .
and the lord open the mouth of the ass , and she say unto balaam , what have i do unto thee , that thou hast smite i these three time ?
and balaam say unto the ass , because thou hast mock i : i would there be a sword in mine hand , for now would i kill thee .
and the ass say unto balaam , be not i thine ass , upon which thou hast ridden ever since i be thine unto this day ? be i ever wont to do so unto thee ?
and he say , nay .
then the lord open the eye of balaam , and he see the angel of the lord standing in the way , and he sword draw in he hand : and he bow down he head , and fall flat on he face .
and the angel of the lord say unto he , wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three time ? behold , i go out to withstand thee , because thy way be perverse before i :
and the ass see i , and turn from i these three time : unless she have turn from i , surely now also i have slay thee , and save she alive .
and balaam say unto the angel of the lord , i have sin ; for i know not that thou stoodest in the way against i : now therefore , if it displease thee , i will get i back again .
and the angel of the lord say unto balaam , go with the man : but only the word that i shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak .
so balaam go with the prince of balak .
and when balak hear that balaam be come , he go out to meet he unto a city of moab , which be in the border of arnon , which be in the utmost coast .
and balak say unto balaam , do i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee ? wherefore camest thou not unto i ? be i not able indeed to promote thee to honour ?
and balaam say unto balak , lo , i be come unto thee : have i now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that god putteth in my mouth , that shall i speak .
and balaam go with balak , and they come unto kirjathhuzoth .
and balak offer ox and sheep , and send to balaam , and to the prince that be with he .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that balak take balaam , and bring he up into the high place of baal , that thence he might see the utmost part of the people .
and balaam say unto balak , build i here seven altar , and prepare i here seven ox and seven ram .
and balak do as balaam have speak ; and balak and balaam offer on every altar a bullock and a ram .
and balaam say unto balak , stand by thy burnt offering , and i will go : peradventure the lord will come to meet i : and whatsoever he sheweth i i will tell thee .
and he go to a high place .
and god meet balaam : and he say unto he , i have prepare seven altar , and i have offer upon every altar a bullock and a ram .
and the lord put a word in balaam 's mouth , and say , return unto balak , and thus thou shalt speak .
and he return unto he , and , lo , he stand by he burnt sacrifice , he , and all the prince of moab .
and he take up he parable , and say , balak the king of moab have bring i from aram , out of the mountain of the east , say , come , curse i jacob , and come , defy israel .
how shall i curse , whom god have not curse ? or how shall i defy , whom the lord have not defy ?
for from the top of the rock i see he , and from the hill i behold he : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckon among the nation .
who can count the dust of jacob , and the number of the fourth part of israel ?
let i die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like he !
and balak say unto balaam , what hast thou do unto i ?
i take thee to curse mine enemy , and , behold , thou hast bless they altogether .
and he answer and say , must i not take heed to speak that which the lord have put in my mouth ?
and balak say unto he , come , i pray thee , with i unto another place , from whence thou mayest see they : thou shalt see but the utmost part of they , and shalt not see they all : and curse i they from thence .
and he bring he into the field of zophim , to the top of pisgah , and build seven altar , and offer a bullock and a ram on every altar .
and he say unto balak , stand here by thy burnt offering , while i meet the lord yonder .
and the lord meet balaam , and put a word in he mouth , and say , go again unto balak , and say thus .
and when he come to he , behold , he stand by he burnt offering , and the prince of moab with he .
and balak say unto he , what have the lord speak ?
and he take up he parable , and say , rise up , balak , and hear ; hearken unto i , thou son of zippor :
god be not a man , that he should lie ; neither the son of man , that he should repent : have he say , and shall he not do it ? or have he speak , and shall he not make it good ?
behold , i have receive commandment to bless : and he have bless ; and i can not reverse it .
he have not beheld iniquity in jacob , neither have he see perverseness in israel : the lord he god be with he , and the shout of a king be among they .
god bring they out of egypt ; he have as it be the strength of a unicorn .
surely there be no enchantment against jacob , neither be there any divination against israel : accord to this time it shall be say of jacob and of israel , what have god work !
behold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drink the blood of the slay .
and balak say unto balaam , neither curse they at all , nor bless they at all .
but balaam answer and say unto balak , tell not i thee , say , all that the lord speaketh , that i must do ?
and balak say unto balaam , come , i pray thee , i will bring thee unto another place ; peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse i they from thence .
and balak bring balaam unto the top of peor , that looketh toward jeshimon .
and balaam say unto balak , build i here seven altar , and prepare i here seven bullock and seven ram .
and balak do as balaam have say , and offer a bullock and a ram on every altar .
and when balaam see that it please the lord to bless israel , he go not , as at other time , to seek for enchantment , but he set he face toward the wilderness .
and balaam lift up he eye , and he see israel abide in he tent accord to they tribe ; and the spirit of god come upon he .
and he take up he parable , and say , balaam the son of beor have say , and the man whose eye be open have say :
he have say , which hear the word of god , which see the vision of the almighty , fall into a trance , but have he eye open :
how goodly be thy tent , o jacob , and thy tabernacle , o israel !
as the valley be they spread forth , as garden by the river 's side , as the tree of lign aloe which the lord have plant , and as cedar tree beside the water .
he shall pour the water out of he bucket , and he seed shall be in many water , and he king shall be higher than agag , and he kingdom shall be exalt .
god bring he forth out of egypt ; he have as it be the strength of a unicorn : he shall eat up the nation he enemy , and shall break they bone , and pierce they through with he arrow .
he couch , he lay down as a lion , and as a great lion : who shall stir he up ?
bless be he that blesseth thee , and curse be he that curseth thee .
and balak 's anger be kindle against balaam , and he smite he hand together : and balak say unto balaam , i call thee to curse mine enemy , and , behold , thou hast altogether bless they these three time .
therefore now flee thou to thy place : i think to promote thee unto great honour ; but , lo , the lord have keep thee back from honour .
and balaam say unto balak , spake i not also to thy messenger which thou sentest unto i , say ,
if balak would give i he house full of silver and gold , i can not go beyond the commandment of the lord , to do either good or bad of mine own mind ; but what the lord saith , that will i speak ?
and now , behold , i go unto my people : come therefore , and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter day .
and he take up he parable , and say , balaam the son of beor have say , and the man whose eye be open have say :
he have say , which hear the word of god , and know the knowledge of the most high , which see the vision of the almighty , fall into a trance , but have he eye open :
i shall see he , but not now : i shall behold he , but not nigh : there shall come a star out of jacob , and a sceptre shall rise out of israel , and shall smite the corner of moab , and destroy all the child of sheth .
and edom shall be a possession , seir also shall be a possession for he enemy ; and israel shall do valiantly .
out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion , and shall destroy he that remaineth of the city .
and when he look on amalek , he take up he parable , and say , amalek be the first of the nation ; but he latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
and he look on the kenites , and take up he parable , and say , strong be thy dwellingplace , and thou puttest thy nest in a rock .
nevertheless the kenite shall be waste , until asshur shall carry thee away captive .
and he take up he parable , and say , alas , who shall live when god doeth this !
and ship shall come from the coast of chittim , and shall afflict asshur , and shall afflict eber , and he also shall perish for ever .
and balaam rise up , and go and return to he place : and balak also go he way .
and israel abode in shittim , and the people begin to commit whoredom with the daughter of moab .
and they call the people unto the sacrifice of they god : and the people do eat , and bow down to they god .
and israel join himself unto baalpeor : and the anger of the lord be kindle against israel .
and the lord say unto mose , take all the head of the people , and hang they up before the lord against the sun , that the fierce anger of the lord may be turn away from israel .

if a man vow a vow unto the lord , or swear a oath to bind he soul with a bond ; he shall not break he word , he shall do accord to all that proceedeth out of he mouth .
if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord , and bind herself by a bond , be in she father 's house in she youth ;
and she father hear she vow , and she bond wherewith she have bind she soul , and she father shall hold he peace at she : then all she vow shall stand , and every bond wherewith she have bind she soul shall stand .
but if she father disallow she in the day that he heareth ; not any of she vow , or of she bond wherewith she have bind she soul , shall stand : and the lord shall forgive she , because she father disallow she .
and if she have at all a husband , when she vow , or utter ought out of she lip , wherewith she bind she soul ;
and she husband hear it , and hold he peace at she in the day that he hear it : then she vow shall stand , and she bond wherewith she bind she soul shall stand .
but if she husband disallow she on the day that he hear it ; then he shall make she vow which she vow , and that which she utter with she lip , wherewith she bind she soul , of none effect : and the lord shall forgive she .
but every vow of a widow , and of she that be divorce , wherewith they have bind they soul , shall stand against she .
and if she vow in she husband 's house , or bind she soul by a bond with a oath ;
and she husband hear it , and hold he peace at she , and disallow she not : then all she vow shall stand , and every bond wherewith she bind she soul shall stand .
but if she husband have utterly make they void on the day he hear they ; then whatsoever proceed out of she lip concern she vow , or concern the bond of she soul , shall not stand : she husband have make they void ; and the lord shall forgive she .
every vow , and every binding oath to afflict the soul , she husband may establish it , or she husband may make it void .
but if she husband altogether hold he peace at she from day to day ; then he establisheth all she vow , or all she bond , which be upon she : he confirmeth they , because he hold he peace at she in the day that he hear they .
but if he shall any way make they void after that he have hear they ; then he shall bear she iniquity .
these be the statute , which the lord command moses , between a man and he wife , between the father and he daughter , be yet in she youth in she father 's house .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
avenge the child of israel of the midianites : afterward shalt thou be gather unto thy people .
and moses spake unto the people , say , arm some of yourselve unto the war , and let they go against the midianites , and avenge the lord of midian .

and they burn all they city wherein they dwell , and all they goodly castle , with fire .
and they take all the spoil , and all the prey , both of man and of beast .
and they bring the captive , and the prey , and the spoil , unto mose , and eleazar the priest , and unto the congregation of the child of israel , unto the camp at the plain of moab , which be by jordan near jericho .
and moses , and eleazar the priest , and all the prince of the congregation , go forth to meet they without the camp .
and moses be wroth with the officer of the host , with the captain over thousand , and captain over hundred , which come from the battle .
and moses say unto they , have ye save all the woman alive ?
behold , these cause the child of israel , through the counsel of balaam , to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor , and there be a plague among the congregation of the lord .
now therefore kill every male among the little one , and kill every woman that have known man by lie with he .
but all the woman child , that have not know a man by lie with he , keep alive for yourselve .
and do ye abide without the camp seven day : whosoever have kill any person , and whosoever have touch any slay , purify both yourselve and you captive on the third day , and on the seventh day .
and purify all you raiment , and all that be make of skin , and all work of goat ' hair , and all thing make of wood .

every thing that may abide the fire , ye shall make it go through the fire , and it shall be clean : nevertheless it shall be purify with the water of separation : and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water .
and ye shall wash you clothes on the seventh day , and ye shall be clean , and afterward ye shall come into the camp .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
take the sum of the prey that be take , both of man and of beast , thou , and eleazar the priest , and the chief father of the congregation :
and divide the prey into two part ; between they that take the war upon they , who go out to battle , and between all the congregation :
and levy a tribute unto the lord of the man of war which go out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the person , and of the beef , and of the ass , and of the sheep :
take it of they half , and give it unto eleazar the priest , for a heave offering of the lord .
and of the child of israel 's half , thou shalt take one portion of fifty , of the person , of the beef , of the ass , and of the flock , of all manner of beast , and give they unto the levites , which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord .
and moses and eleazar the priest do as the lord command moses .

and the person be sixteen thousand ; of which the lord 's tribute be thirty and two person .
and moses give the tribute , which be the lord 's heave offering , unto eleazar the priest , as the lord command moses .
and of the child of israel 's half , which mose divide from the man that war ,
( now the half that pertain unto the congregation be three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep ,
and thirty and six thousand beef ,
and thirty thousand ass and five hundred ,
and sixteen thousand person ; )
even of the child of israel 's half , moses take one portion of fifty , both of man and of beast , and give they unto the levites , which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord ; as the lord command moses .
and the officer which be over thousand of the host , the captain of thousand , and captain of hundred , come near unto mose :
and they say unto mose , thy servant have take the sum of the man of war which be under we charge , and there lacketh not one man of we .
we have therefore bring a oblation for the lord , what every man have get , of jewel of gold , chain , and bracelet , ring , earring , and tablet , to make a atonement for we soul before the lord .
and moses and eleazar the priest take the gold of they , even all work jewel .
and all the gold of the offering that they offer up to the lord , of the captain of thousand , and of the captain of hundred , be sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekel .
( for the man of war have take spoil , every man for himself . )
and moses and eleazar the priest take the gold of the captain of thousand and of hundred , and bring it into the tabernacle of the congregation , for a memorial for the child of israel before the lord .
now the child of reuben and the child of gad have a very great multitude of cattle : and when they see the land of jazer , and the land of gilead , that , behold , the place be a place for cattle ;
the child of gad and the child of reuben come and speak unto mose , and to eleazar the priest , and unto the prince of the congregation , say ,

even the country which the lord smite before the congregation of israel , be a land for cattle , and thy servant have cattle :
wherefore , say they , if we have find grace in thy sight , let this land be give unto thy servant for a possession , and bring we not over jordan .
and moses say unto the child of gad and to the child of reuben , shall you brethren go to war , and shall ye sit here ?
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the child of israel from go over into the land which the lord have give they ?
thus do you father , when i send they from kadeshbarnea to see the land .
for when they go up unto the valley of eshcol , and see the land , they discourage the heart of the child of israel , that they should not go into the land which the lord have give they .
and the lord 's anger be kindle the same time , and he sware , say ,
surely none of the man that come up out of egypt , from twenty year old and upward , shall see the land which i sware unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob ; because they have not wholly follow i :
save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite , and joshua the son of nun : for they have wholly follow the lord .
and the lord 's anger be kindle against israel , and he make they wander in the wilderness forty year , until all the generation , that have do evil in the sight of the lord , be consume .
and , behold , ye be rise up in you father ' stead , a increase of sinful man , to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel .
for if ye turn away from after he , he will yet again leave they in the wilderness ; and ye shall destroy all this people .
and they come near unto he , and say , we will build sheepfold here for we cattle , and city for we little one :
but we ourselves will go ready arm before the child of israel , until we have bring they unto they place : and we little one shall dwell in the fenced city because of the inhabitant of the land .
we will not return unto we house , until the child of israel have inherit every man he inheritance .
for we will not inherit with they on yonder side jordan , or forward ; because we inheritance be fall to we on this side jordan eastward .
and moses say unto they , if ye will do this thing , if ye will go armed before the lord to war ,
and will go all of you arm over jordan before the lord , until he have drive out he enemy from before he ,
and the land be subdue before the lord : then afterward ye shall return , and be guiltless before the lord , and before israel ; and this land shall be you possession before the lord .
but if ye will not do so , behold , ye have sin against the lord : and be sure you sin will find you out .
build you city for you little one , and fold for you sheep ; and do that which have proceed out of you mouth .
and the child of gad and the child of reuben spake unto moses , say , thy servant will do as my lord commandeth .
we little one , we wife , we flock , and all we cattle , shall be there in the city of gilead :
but thy servant will pass over , every man arm for war , before the lord to battle , as my lord saith .
so concern they moses command eleazar the priest , and joshua the son of nun , and the chief father of the tribe of the child of israel :
and moses say unto they , if the child of gad and the child of reuben will pass with you over jordan , every man arm to battle , before the lord , and the land shall be subdue before you ; then ye shall give they the land of gilead for a possession :
but if they will not pass over with you armed , they shall have possession among you in the land of canaan .
and the child of gad and the child of reuben answer , say , as the lord have say unto thy servant , so will we do .
we will pass over arm before the lord into the land of canaan , that the possession of we inheritance on this side jordan may be ours .
and moses give unto they , even to the child of gad , and to the child of reuben , and unto half the tribe of manasseh the son of joseph , the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites , and the kingdom of og king of bashan , the land , with the city thereof in the coast , even the city of the country round about .
and the child of gad build dibon , and ataroth , and aroer ,
and atroth , shophan , and jaazer , and jogbehah ,
and bethnimrah , and bethharan , fenced city : and fold for sheep .
and the child of reuben build heshbon , and elealeh , and kirjathaim ,
and nebo , and baalmeon , ( they name be change , ) and shibmah : and give other name unto the city which they build .
and the child of machir the son of manasseh go to gilead , and take it , and dispossess the amorite which be in it .
and moses give gilead unto machir the son of manasseh ; and he dwell therein .
and jair the son of manasseh go and take the small town thereof , and call they havothjair .
and nobah go and take kenath , and the village thereof , and call it nobah , after he own name .
these be the journey of the child of israel , which go forth out of the land of egypt with they army under the hand of moses and aaron .
and moses write they going out accord to they journey by the commandment of the lord : and these be they journey accord to they going out .
and they depart from rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the morrow after the passover the child of israel go out with a high hand in the sight of all the egyptians .
for the egyptians bury all they firstborn , which the lord have smite among they : upon they god also the lord execute judgment .
and the child of israel remove from rameses , and pitch in succoth .
