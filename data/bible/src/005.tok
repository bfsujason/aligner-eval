and the earth be without form , and void ; and darkness be upon the face of the deep .
and the spirit of god move upon the face of the water .
and god say , let there be light : and there be light .
and god see the light , that it be good : and god divide the light from the darkness .
and god call the light day , and the darkness he call night .
and the evening and the morning be the first day .
and god say , let there be a firmament in the midst of the water , and let it divide the water from the water .
and god make the firmament , and divide the water which be under the firmament from the water which be above the firmament : and it be so .
and god call the firmament heaven .
and the evening and the morning be the second day .
and god say , let the water under the heaven be gather together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it be so .
and god call the dry land earth ; and the gathering together of the water call he sea : and god see that it be good .
and god say , let the earth bring forth grass , the herb yield seed , and the fruit tree yield fruit after he kind , whose seed be in itself , upon the earth : and it be so .
and the earth bring forth grass , and herb yielding seed after he kind , and the tree yield fruit , whose seed be in itself , after he kind : and god see that it be good .
and the evening and the morning be the third day .
and god say , let there be light in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let they be for sign , and for season , and for day , and year :
and let they be for light in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth : and it be so .
and god make two great light ; the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night : he make the star also .
and god set they in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth ,
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness : and god see that it be good .
and the evening and the morning be the fourth day .
and god say , let the water bring forth abundantly the move creature that have life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
and god create great whale , and every living creature that moveth , which the water bring forth abundantly , after they kind , and every winged fowl after he kind : and god see that it be good .
and god bless they , say , be fruitful , and multiply , and fill the water in the sea , and let fowl multiply in the earth .

and on the seventh day god end he work which he have make ; and he rest on the seventh day from all he work which he have make .
and god bless the seventh day , and sanctify it : because that in it he have rest from all he work which god create and make .
these be the generation of the heaven and of the earth when they be create , in the day that the lord god make the earth and the heaven ,
and every plant of the field before it be in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grow : for the lord god have not cause it to rain upon the earth , and there be not a man to till the ground .
but there go up a mist from the earth , and water the whole face of the ground .
and the lord god form man of the dust of the ground , and breathe into he nostril the breath of life ; and man become a living soul .
and the lord god plant a garden eastward in eden ; and there he put the man whom he have form .
and out of the ground make the lord god to grow every tree that be pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
and a river go out of eden to water the garden ; and from thence it be part , and become into four head .
the name of the first be pison : that be it which compasseth the whole land of havilah , where there be gold ;
and the gold of that land be good : there be bdellium and the onyx stone .
and the name of the second river be gihon : the same be it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia .
and the name of the third river be hiddekel : that be it which goeth toward the east of assyria .
and the fourth river be euphrates .
and the lord god take the man , and put he into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it .
and the lord god command the man , say , of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat :
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die .
and the lord god say , it be not good that the man should be alone ; i will make he a help meet for he .
and out of the ground the lord god form every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air ; and bring they unto adam to see what he would call they : and whatsoever adam call every living creature , that be the name thereof .
and adam give name to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for adam there be not find a help meet for he .
and the lord god cause a deep sleep to fall upon adam , and he sleep : and he take one of he rib , and close up the flesh instead thereof ;
and the rib , which the lord god have take from man , make he a woman , and bring she unto the man .
and adam say , this be now bone of my bone , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be call woman , because she be take out of man .
therefore shall a man leave he father and he mother , and shall cleave unto he wife : and they shall be one flesh .
and they be both naked , the man and he wife , and be not ashamed .
now the serpent be more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god have make .
and he say unto the woman , yea , have god say , ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
and the woman say unto the serpent , we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden :
but of the fruit of the tree which be in the midst of the garden , god have say , ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and the serpent say unto the woman , ye shall not surely die :
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then you eye shall be open , and ye shall be as god , know good and evil .
and when the woman see that the tree be good for food , and that it be pleasant to the eye , and a tree to be desire to make one wise , she take of the fruit thereof , and do eat , and give also unto she husband with she ; and he do eat .
and the eye of they both be open , and they know that they be naked ; and they sew fig leaf together , and make themselves apron .
and they hear the voice of the lord god walk in the garden in the cool of the day : and adam and he wife hide themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the tree of the garden .
and the lord god call unto adam , and say unto he , where art thou ?
and he say , i hear thy voice in the garden , and i be afraid , because i be naked ; and i hide myself .
and he say , who tell thee that thou wast naked ?
hast thou eat of the tree , whereof i command thee that thou shouldest not eat ?
and the man say , the woman whom thou gavest to be with i , she give i of the tree , and i do eat .
and the lord god say unto the woman , what be this that thou hast do ?
and the woman say , the serpent beguile i , and i do eat .
and the lord god say unto the serpent , because thou hast do this , thou art curse above all cattle , and above every beast of the field ; upon thy belly shalt thou go , and dust shalt thou eat all the day of thy life :
and i will put enmity between thee and the woman , and between thy seed and she seed ; it shall bruise thy head , and thou shalt bruise he heel .
unto the woman he say , i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth child ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
and unto adam he say , because thou hast hearken unto the voice of thy wife , and hast eat of the tree , of which i command thee , say , thou shalt not eat of it : curse be the ground for thy sake ; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the day of thy life ;
thorns also and thistle shall it bring forth to thee ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ;
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it be thou take : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
and adam call he wife 's name eve ; because she be the mother of all living .
unto adam also and to he wife do the lord god make coat of skin , and clothe they .
and the lord god say , behold , the man be become as one of we , to know good and evil : and now , lest he put forth he hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever :
therefore the lord god send he forth from the garden of eden , to till the ground from whence he be take .
so he drive out the man ; and he place at the east of the garden of eden cherubims , and a flaming sword which turn every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
and adam know eve he wife ; and she conceive , and bare cain , and say , i have get a man from the lord .
and she again bare he brother abel .
and abel be a keeper of sheep , but cain be a tiller of the ground .
and in process of time it come to pass , that cain bring of the fruit of the ground a offering unto the lord .
and abel , he also bring of the firstling of he flock and of the fat thereof .
and the lord have respect unto abel and to he offering :
but unto cain and to he offering he have not respect .
and cain be very wroth , and he countenance fell .
and the lord say unto cain , why art thou wroth ? and why be thy countenance fall ?
if thou doest well , shalt thou not be accept ? and if thou doest not well , sin lieth at the door .
and unto thee shall be he desire , and thou shalt rule over he .
and cain talk with abel he brother : and it come to pass , when they be in the field , that cain rise up against abel he brother , and slew he .
and the lord say unto cain , where be abel thy brother ?
and he say , i know not : be i my brother 's keeper ?
and he say , what hast thou do ? the voice of thy brother 's blood crieth unto i from the ground .
and now art thou curse from the earth , which have open she mouth to receive thy brother 's blood from thy hand ;
when thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee she strength ; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth .
and cain say unto the lord , my punishment be greater than i can bear .
behold , thou hast drive i out this day from the face of the earth ; and from thy face shall i be hide ; and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth ; and it shall come to pass , that every one that findeth i shall slay i .
and the lord say unto he , therefore whosoever slayeth cain , vengeance shall be take on he sevenfold .
and the lord set a mark upon cain , lest any find he should kill he .
and cain go out from the presence of the lord , and dwelt in the land of nod , on the east of eden .
and cain know he wife ; and she conceive , and bare enoch : and he build a city , and call the name of the city , after the name of he son , enoch .
and unto enoch be bear irad : and irad beget mehujael : and mehujael beget methusael : and methusael beget lamech .
and lamech take unto he two wife : the name of the one be adah , and the name of the other zillah .
and adah bare jabal : he be the father of such as dwell in tent , and of such as have cattle .
and he brother 's name be jubal : he be the father of all such as handle the harp and organ .
and zillah , she also bare tubalcain , a instructer of every artificer in brass and iron : and the sister of tubalcain be naamah .
and lamech say unto he wife , adah and zillah , hear my voice ; ye wife of lamech , hearken unto my speech : for i have slay a man to my wounding , and a young man to my hurt .
if cain shall be avenge sevenfold , truly lamech seventy and sevenfold .
and adam know he wife again ; and she bare a son , and call he name seth : for god , say she , have appoint i another seed instead of abel , whom cain slew .
and to seth , to he also there be bear a son ; and he call he name enos : then begin man to call upon the name of the lord .
this be the book of the generation of adam .
in the day that god create man , in the likeness of god make he he ;
male and female create he they ; and bless they , and call they name adam , in the day when they be create .
and adam live a hundred and thirty year , and beget a son in he own likeness , after he image ; and call he name seth :

and it come to pass , when man begin to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughter be bear unto they ,
that the son of god see the daughter of man that they be fair ; and they take they wife of all which they choose .
and the lord say , my spirit shall not always strive with man , for that he also be flesh : yet he day shall be a hundred and twenty year .
there be giant in the earth in those day ; and also after that , when the son of god come in unto the daughter of man , and they bare child to they , the same become mighty man which be of old , man of renown .
and god see that the wickedness of man be great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thought of he heart be only evil continually .
and it repent the lord that he have make man on the earth , and it grieve he at he heart .
and the lord say , i will destroy man whom i have create from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the creep thing , and the fowl of the air ; for it repenteth i that i have make they .
but noah find grace in the eye of the lord .
these be the generation of noah : noah be a just man and perfect in he generation , and noah walk with god .
and noah beget three son , shem , ham , and japheth .
the earth also be corrupt before god , and the earth be fill with violence .
and god look upon the earth , and , behold , it be corrupt ; for all flesh have corrupt he way upon the earth .
and god say unto noah , the end of all flesh be come before i ; for the earth be fill with violence through they ; and , behold , i will destroy they with the earth .
make thee a ark of gopher wood ; room shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
and this be the fashion which thou shalt make it of : the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubit , the breadth of it fifty cubit , and the height of it thirty cubit .
a window shalt thou make to the ark , and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above ; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof ; with lower , second , and third story shalt thou make it .
and , behold , i , even i , do bring a flood of water upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein be the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that be in the earth shall die .
but with thee will i establish my covenant ; and thou shalt come into the ark , thou , and thy son , and thy wife , and thy son ' wife with thee .
and of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark , to keep they alive with thee ; they shall be male and female .
of fowl after they kind , and of cattle after they kind , of every creep thing of the earth after he kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep they alive .
and take thou unto thee of all food that be eat , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for they .
thus do noah ; accord to all that god command he , so do he .
and the lord say unto noah , come thou and all thy house into the ark ; for thee have i see righteous before i in this generation .
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by seven , the male and he female : and of beast that be not clean by two , the male and he female .

and noah do accord unto all that the lord command he .
and noah be six hundred year old when the flood of water be upon the earth .
and noah go in , and he son , and he wife , and he son ' wife with he , into the ark , because of the water of the flood .
of clean beast , and of beast that be not clean , and of fowl , and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth ,
there go in two and two unto noah into the ark , the male and the female , as god have command noah .
and it come to pass after seven day , that the water of the flood be upon the earth .

and they go in unto noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein be the breath of life .
and they that go in , go in male and female of all flesh , as god have command he : and the lord shut he in .
and the flood be forty day upon the earth ; and the water increase , and bare up the ark , and it be lift up above the earth .
and the water prevail , and be increase greatly upon the earth ; and the ark go upon the face of the water .
and the water prevail exceedingly upon the earth ; and all the high hill , that be under the whole heaven , be cover .
fifteen cubit upward do the water prevail ; and the mountain be cover .
and all flesh die that move upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every creep thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man :
all in whose nostril be the breath of life , of all that be in the dry land , die .
and every living substance be destroy which be upon the face of the ground , both man , and cattle , and the creep thing , and the fowl of the heaven ; and they be destroy from the earth : and noah only remain alive , and they that be with he in the ark .
and the water prevail upon the earth a hundred and fifty day .
and god remember noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that be with he in the ark : and god make a wind to pass over the earth , and the water asswage ;

and it come to pass at the end of forty day , that noah open the window of the ark which he have make :
and he send forth a raven , which go forth to and fro , until the water be dry up from off the earth .
also he send forth a dive from he , to see if the water be abate from off the face of the ground ;
but the dive find no rest for the sole of she foot , and she return unto he into the ark , for the water be on the face of the whole earth : then he put forth he hand , and take she , and pull she in unto he into the ark .
and he stay yet other seven day ; and again he send forth the dive out of the ark ;
and the dive come in to he in the evening ; and , lo , in she mouth be a olive leaf pluckt off : so noah know that the water be abate from off the earth .
and he stay yet other seven day ; and send forth the dive ; which return not again unto he any more .
and it come to pass in the six hundredth and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the water be dry up from off the earth : and noah remove the covering of the ark , and look , and , behold , the face of the ground be dry .
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , be the earth dry .
and god speak unto noah , say ,
go forth of the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy son , and thy son ' wife with thee .
bring forth with thee every living thing that be with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creep thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
and noah go forth , and he son , and he wife , and he son ' wife with he :
every beast , every creep thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after they kind , go forth out of the ark .
and noah build a altar unto the lord ; and take of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offer burnt offering on the altar .
and the lord smell a sweet savour ; and the lord say in he heart , i will not again curse the ground any more for man 's sake ; for the imagination of man 's heart be evil from he youth ; neither will i again smite any more every thing living , as i have do .
while the earth remaineth , seedtime and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease .
and god bless noah and he son , and say unto they , be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth .
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth , and upon every fowl of the air , upon all that moveth upon the earth , and upon all the fish of the sea ; into you hand be they deliver .
every move thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have i give you all thing .
but flesh with the life thereof , which be the blood thereof , shall ye not eat .
and surely you blood of you life will i require ; at the hand of every beast will i require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will i require the life of man .
whoso sheddeth man 's blood , by man shall he blood be shed : for in the image of god make he man .
and you , be ye fruitful , and multiply ; bring forth abundantly in the earth , and multiply therein .
and god speak unto noah , and to he son with he , say ,
and i , behold , i establish my covenant with you , and with you seed after you ;
and with every living creature that be with you , of the fowl , of the cattle , and of every beast of the earth with you ; from all that go out of the ark , to every beast of the earth .
and i will establish my covenant with you ; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the water of a flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth .
and god say , this be the token of the covenant which i make between i and you and every living creature that be with you , for perpetual generation :
i do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between i and the earth .
and it shall come to pass , when i bring a cloud over the earth , that the bow shall be see in the cloud :
and i will remember my covenant , which be between i and you and every living creature of all flesh ; and the water shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
and the bow shall be in the cloud ; and i will look upon it , that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that be upon the earth .
and god say unto noah , this be the token of the covenant , which i have establish between i and all flesh that be upon the earth .

and it come to pass , as they journey from the east , that they find a plain in the land of shinar ; and they dwell there .
and they say one to another , go to , let we make brick , and burn they thoroughly .
and they have brick for stone , and slime have they for morter .
and they say , go to , let we build we a city and a tower , whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let we make we a name , lest we be scatter abroad upon the face of the whole earth .
and the lord come down to see the city and the tower , which the child of man build .
and the lord say , behold , the people be one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrain from they , which they have imagine to do .
go to , let we go down , and there confound they language , that they may not understand one another 's speech .
so the lord scatter they abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth : and they leave off to build the city .
therefore be the name of it call babel ; because the lord do there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence do the lord scatter they abroad upon the face of all the earth .
these be the generation of shem : shem be a hundred year old , and begat arphaxad two year after the flood :
and shem live after he beget arphaxad five hundred year , and begat son and daughter .
and arphaxad live five and thirty year , and beget salah :
and arphaxad live after he beget salah four hundred and three year , and begat son and daughter .
and salah live thirty year , and beget eber :
and salah live after he beget eber four hundred and three year , and begat son and daughter .
and eber live four and thirty year , and beget peleg :
and eber live after he beget peleg four hundred and thirty year , and begat son and daughter .
and peleg live thirty year , and begat reu :
and peleg live after he beget reu two hundred and nine year , and begat son and daughter .
and reu live two and thirty year , and beget serug :
and reu live after he beget serug two hundred and seven year , and begat son and daughter .
and serug live thirty year , and beget nahor :
and serug live after he beget nahor two hundred year , and begat son and daughter .
and nahor live nine and twenty year , and beget terah :
and nahor live after he beget terah a hundred and nineteen year , and begat son and daughter .
and terah live seventy year , and beget abram , nahor , and haran .
now these be the generation of terah : terah beget abram , nahor , and haran ; and haran beget lot .
and haran die before he father terah in the land of he nativity , in ur of the chaldees .
and abram and nahor take they wife : the name of abram 's wife be sarai ; and the name of nahor 's wife , milcah , the daughter of haran , the father of milcah , and the father of iscah .
but sarai be barren ; she have no child .
and terah take abram he son , and lot the son of haran he son 's son , and sarai he daughter in law , he son abram 's wife ; and they go forth with they from ur of the chaldees , to go into the land of canaan ; and they come unto haran , and dwelt there .
and the day of terah be two hundred and five year : and terah die in haran .
now the lord have say unto abram , get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and from thy father 's house , unto a land that i will shew thee :
and i will make of thee a great nation , and i will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and thou shalt be a blessing :
and i will bless they that bless thee , and curse he that curseth thee : and in thee shall all family of the earth be bless .
so abram depart , as the lord have speak unto he ; and lot go with he : and abram be seventy and five year old when he depart out of haran .
and abram take sarai he wife , and lot he brother 's son , and all they substance that they have gather , and the soul that they have get in haran ; and they go forth to go into the land of canaan ; and into the land of canaan they come .
and abram pass through the land unto the place of sichem , unto the plain of moreh .
and the canaanite be then in the land .
and the lord appear unto abram , and say , unto thy seed will i give this land : and there build he a altar unto the lord , who appear unto he .
and he remove from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel , and pitch he tent , have bethel on the west , and hai on the east : and there he build a altar unto the lord , and call upon the name of the lord .
and abram journey , go on still toward the south .
and there be a famine in the land : and abram go down into egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine be grievous in the land .
and it come to pass , when he be come near to enter into egypt , that he say unto sarai he wife , behold now , i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
therefore it shall come to pass , when the egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , this be he wife : and they will kill i , but they will save thee alive .
say , i pray thee , thou art my sister : that it may be well with i for thy sake ; and my soul shall live because of thee .
and it come to pass , that , when abram be come into egypt , the egyptians behold the woman that she be very fair .
the prince also of pharaoh see she , and commend she before pharaoh : and the woman be take into pharaoh 's house .
and he entreat abram well for she sake : and he have sheep , and ox , and he ass , and manservant , and maidservant , and she ass , and camel .
and the lord plague pharaoh and he house with great plague because of sarai abram 's wife .
and pharaoh call abram , and say , what be this that thou hast do unto i ? why didst thou not tell i that she be thy wife ?
why saidst thou , she be my sister ? so i might have take she to i to wife : now therefore behold thy wife , take she , and go thy way .
and pharaoh command he man concern he : and they send he away , and he wife , and all that he have .
and abram go up out of egypt , he , and he wife , and all that he have , and lot with he , into the south .
and abram be very rich in cattle , in silver , and in gold .
and he go on he journey from the south even to bethel , unto the place where he tent have be at the beginning , between bethel and hai ;
unto the place of the altar , which he have make there at the first : and there abram call on the name of the lord .
and lot also , which go with abram , have flock , and herd , and tent .
and the land be not able to bear they , that they might dwell together : for they substance be great , so that they could not dwell together .
and there be a strife between the herdman of abram 's cattle and the herdman of lot 's cattle : and the canaanite and the perizzite dwell then in the land .
and abram say unto lot , let there be no strife , i pray thee , between i and thee , and between my herdman and thy herdman ; for we be brethren .
be not the whole land before thee ? separate thyself , i pray thee , from i : if thou wilt take the left hand , then i will go to the right ; or if thou depart to the right hand , then i will go to the left .
and lot lift up he eye , and behold all the plain of jordan , that it be well water every where , before the lord destroy sodom and gomorrah , even as the garden of the lord , like the land of egypt , as thou comest unto zoar .
then lot choose he all the plain of jordan ; and lot journey east : and they separate themselves the one from the other .
abram dwell in the land of canaan , and lot dwell in the city of the plain , and pitch he tent toward sodom .
but the man of sodom be wicked and sinner before the lord exceedingly .
and the lord say unto abram , after that lot be separate from he , lift up now thine eye , and look from the place where thou art northward , and southward , and eastward , and westward :
for all the land which thou seest , to thee will i give it , and to thy seed for ever .
and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be number .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for i will give it unto thee .
then abram remove he tent , and come and dwelt in the plain of mamre , which be in hebron , and build there a altar unto the lord .
and it come to pass in the day of amraphel king of shinar , arioch king of ellasar , chedorlaomer king of elam , and tidal king of nation ;
that these make war with bera king of sodom , and with birsha king of gomorrah , shinab king of admah , and shemeber king of zeboiim , and the king of bela , which be zoar .
all these be join together in the vale of siddim , which be the salt sea .
twelve year they serve chedorlaomer , and in the thirteenth year they rebel .
and in the fourteenth year come chedorlaomer , and the king that be with he , and smite the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim , and the zuzims in ham , and the emim in shaveh kiriathaim ,
and the horites in they mount seir , unto elparan , which be by the wilderness .
and they return , and come to enmishpat , which be kadesh , and smite all the country of the amalekites , and also the amorites , that dwelt in hazezontamar .
and there go out the king of sodom , and the king of gomorrah , and the king of admah , and the king of zeboiim , and the king of bela ( the same be zoar ; ) and they join battle with they in the vale of siddim ;
with chedorlaomer the king of elam , and with tidal king of nation , and amraphel king of shinar , and arioch king of ellasar ; four king with five .
and the vale of siddim be full of slimepit ; and the king of sodom and gomorrah flee , and fall there ; and they that remain flee to the mountain .
and they take all the goods of sodom and gomorrah , and all they victuals , and go they way .
and they take lot , abram 's brother 's son , who dwell in sodom , and he goods , and depart .
and there come one that have escape , and tell abram the hebrew ; for he dwell in the plain of mamre the amorite , brother of eshcol , and brother of aner : and these be confederate with abram .
and when abram hear that he brother be take captive , he arm he trained servant , bear in he own house , three hundred and eighteen , and pursue they unto dan .
and he divide himself against they , he and he servant , by night , and smite they , and pursue they unto hobah , which be on the left hand of damascus .
and he bring back all the goods , and also bring again he brother lot , and he goods , and the woman also , and the people .
and the king of sodom go out to meet he after he return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer , and of the king that be with he , at the valley of shaveh , which be the king 's dale .
and melchizedek king of salem bring forth bread and wine : and he be the priest of the most high god .
and he bless he , and say , blessed be abram of the most high god , possessor of heaven and earth :
and bless be the most high god , which have deliver thine enemy into thy hand .
and he give he tithe of all .
and the king of sodom say unto abram , give i the person , and take the goods to thyself .
and abram say to the king of sodom , i have lift up mine hand unto the lord , the most high god , the possessor of heaven and earth ,
that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet , and that i will not take any thing that be thine , lest thou shouldest say , i have make abram rich :
save only that which the young man have eat , and the portion of the man which go with i , aner , eshcol , and mamre ; let they take they portion .
after these thing the word of the lord come unto abram in a vision , say , fear not , abram : i be thy shield , and thy exceed great reward .
and abram say , lord god , what wilt thou give i , see i go childless , and the steward of my house be this eliezer of damascus ?
and abram say , behold , to i thou hast give no seed : and , lo , one bear in my house be mine heir .
and , behold , the word of the lord come unto he , say , this shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
and he bring he forth abroad , and say , look now toward heaven , and tell the star , if thou be able to number they : and he say unto he , so shall thy seed be .
and he believe in the lord ; and he count it to he for righteousness .
and he say unto he , i be the lord that bring thee out of ur of the chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it .
and he say , lord god , whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it ?
and he say unto he , take i a heifer of three year old , and a she goat of three year old , and a ram of three year old , and a turtledove , and a young pigeon .
and he take unto he all these , and divide they in the midst , and lay each piece one against another : but the bird divide he not .
and when the fowl come down upon the carcase , abram drive they away .
and when the sun be go down , a deep sleep fall upon abram ; and , lo , a horror of great darkness fall upon he .
and he say unto abram , know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that be not theirs , and shall serve they ; and they shall afflict they four hundred year ;
and also that nation , whom they shall serve , will i judge : and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
and thou shalt go to thy father in peace ; thou shalt be bury in a good old age .
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again : for the iniquity of the amorites be not yet full .
and it come to pass , that , when the sun go down , and it be dark , behold a smoking furnace , and a burning lamp that pass between those piece .
in the same day the lord make a covenant with abram , say , unto thy seed have i give this land , from the river of egypt unto the great river , the river euphrates :
the kenites , and the kenizzites , and the kadmonites ,
and the hittites , and the perizzites , and the rephaims ,
and the amorites , and the canaanites , and the girgashites , and the jebusites .
now sarai abram 's wife bare he no child : and she have a handmaid , a egyptian , whose name be hagar .
and sarai say unto abram , behold now , the lord have restrain i from bearing : i pray thee , go in unto my maid ; it may be that i may obtain child by she .
and abram hearken to the voice of sarai .
and sarai abram 's wife take hagar she maid the egyptian , after abram have dwell ten year in the land of canaan , and give she to she husband abram to be he wife .
and he go in unto hagar , and she conceive : and when she see that she have conceive , she mistress be despise in she eye .
and sarai say unto abram , my wrong be upon thee : i have give my maid into thy bosom ; and when she see that she have conceive , i be despise in she eye : the lord judge between i and thee .
but abram say unto sarai , behold , thy maid be in thy hand ; do to she as it pleaseth thee .
and when sarai deal hardly with she , she flee from she face .
and the angel of the lord find she by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to shur .
and he say , hagar , sarai 's maid , whence camest thou ? and whither wilt thou go ?
and she say , i flee from the face of my mistress sarai .
and the angel of the lord say unto she , return to thy mistress , and submit thyself under she hand .
and the angel of the lord say unto she , i will multiply thy seed exceedingly , that it shall not be number for multitude .
and the angel of the lord say unto she , behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call he name ishmael ; because the lord have hear thy affliction .
and he will be a wild man ; he hand will be against every man , and every man 's hand against he ; and he shall dwell in the presence of all he brethren .
and she call the name of the lord that speak unto she , thou god seest i : for she say , have i also here look after he that seeth i ?
wherefore the well be call beerlahairoi ; behold , it be between kadesh and bered .
and hagar bare abram a son : and abram call he son 's name , which hagar bare , ishmael .
and abram be fourscore and six year old , when hagar bare ishmael to abram .
and when abram be ninety year old and nine , the lord appear to abram , and say unto he , i be the almighty god ; walk before i , and be thou perfect .
and i will make my covenant between i and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly .
and abram fall on he face : and god talk with he , say ,
as for i , behold , my covenant be with thee , and thou shalt be a father of many nation .
neither shall thy name any more be call abram , but thy name shall be abraham ; for a father of many nation have i make thee .
and i will make thee exceed fruitful , and i will make nation of thee , and king shall come out of thee .
and i will establish my covenant between i and thee and thy seed after thee in they generation for a everlasting covenant , to be a god unto thee , and to thy seed after thee .
and i will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of canaan , for a everlasting possession ; and i will be they god .
and god say unto abraham , thou shalt keep my covenant therefore , thou , and thy seed after thee in they generation .
this be my covenant , which ye shall keep , between i and you and thy seed after thee ; every man child among you shall be circumcise .
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of you foreskin ; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt i and you .
and he that be eight day old shall be circumcise among you , every man child in you generation , he that be bear in the house , or buy with money of any stranger , which be not of thy seed .
he that be bear in thy house , and he that be buy with thy money , must need be circumcise : and my covenant shall be in you flesh for a everlasting covenant .
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of he foreskin be not circumcise , that soul shall be cut off from he people ; he have broken my covenant .
and god say unto abraham , as for sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call she name sarai , but sarah shall she name be .
and i will bless she , and give thee a son also of she : yea , i will bless she , and she shall be a mother of nation ; king of people shall be of she .
then abraham fall upon he face , and laugh , and say in he heart , shall a child be bear unto he that be a hundred year old ? and shall sarah , that be ninety year old , bear ?
and abraham say unto god , o that ishmael might live before thee !
and god say , sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed ; and thou shalt call he name isaac : and i will establish my covenant with he for a everlasting covenant , and with he seed after he .
and as for ishmael , i have hear thee : behold , i have bless he , and will make he fruitful , and will multiply he exceedingly ; twelve prince shall he beget , and i will make he a great nation .
but my covenant will i establish with isaac , which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year .
and he leave off talk with he , and god go up from abraham .
and abraham take ishmael he son , and all that be bear in he house , and all that be buy with he money , every male among the man of abraham 's house ; and circumcise the flesh of they foreskin in the selfsame day , as god have say unto he .
and abraham be ninety year old and nine , when he be circumcise in the flesh of he foreskin .
and ishmael he son be thirteen year old , when he be circumcise in the flesh of he foreskin .
in the selfsame day be abraham circumcise , and ishmael he son .
and all the man of he house , bear in the house , and buy with money of the stranger , be circumcise with he .
and the lord appear unto he in the plain of mamre : and he sit in the tent door in the heat of the day ;
and he lift up he eye and look , and , lo , three man stand by he : and when he see they , he run to meet they from the tent door , and bow himself toward the ground ,
and say , my lord , if now i have find favour in thy sight , pass not away , i pray thee , from thy servant :
let a little water , i pray you , be fetch , and wash you foot , and rest yourselve under the tree :
and i will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye you heart ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore be ye come to you servant .
and they say , so do , as thou hast say .
and abraham hasten into the tent unto sarah , and say , make ready quickly three measure of fine meal , knead it , and make cake upon the hearth .
and abraham run unto the herd , and fetcht a calf tender and good , and give it unto a young man ; and he hast to dress it .
and he take butter , and milk , and the calf which he have dress , and set it before they ; and he stand by they under the tree , and they do eat .
and they say unto he , where be sarah thy wife ?
and he say , behold , in the tent .
and he say , i will certainly return unto thee accord to the time of life ; and , lo , sarah thy wife shall have a son .
and sarah hear it in the tent door , which be behind he .
now abraham and sarah be old and well stricken in age ; and it cease to be with sarah after the manner of woman .
therefore sarah laugh within herself , say , after i be wax old shall i have pleasure , my lord be old also ?
and the lord say unto abraham , wherefore do sarah laugh , say , shall i of a surety bear a child , which be old ?
be any thing too hard for the lord ?
at the time appoint i will return unto thee , accord to the time of life , and sarah shall have a son .
then sarah deny , say , i laugh not ; for she be afraid .
and he say , nay ; but thou didst laugh .
and the man rise up from thence , and look toward sodom : and abraham go with they to bring they on the way .
and the lord say , shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do ;
see that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nation of the earth shall be bless in he ?
for i know he , that he will command he child and he household after he , and they shall keep the way of the lord , to do justice and judgment ; that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he have speak of he .
and the lord say , because the cry of sodom and gomorrah be great , and because they sin be very grievous ;
i will go down now , and see whether they have do altogether accord to the cry of it , which be come unto i ; and if not , i will know .
and the man turn they face from thence , and go toward sodom : but abraham stand yet before the lord .
and abraham draw near , and say , wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked ?
peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city : wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that be therein ?
that be far from thee to do after this manner , to slay the righteous with the wicked : and that the righteous should be as the wicked , that be far from thee : shall not the judge of all the earth do right ?
and the lord say , if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city , then i will spare all the place for they sake .
and abraham answer and say , behold now , i have take upon i to speak unto the lord , which be but dust and ash :
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous : wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five ?
and he say , if i find there forty and five , i will not destroy it .
and he speak unto he yet again , and say , peradventure there shall be forty find there .
and he say , i will not do it for forty 's sake .
and he say unto he , oh let not the lord be angry , and i will speak : peradventure there shall thirty be find there .
and he say , i will not do it , if i find thirty there .
and he say , behold now , i have take upon i to speak unto the lord : peradventure there shall be twenty find there .
and he say , i will not destroy it for twenty 's sake .
and he say , oh let not the lord be angry , and i will speak yet but this once : peradventure ten shall be find there .
and he say , i will not destroy it for ten 's sake .
and the lord go he way , as soon as he have leave commune with abraham : and abraham return unto he place .
and there come two angel to sodom at even ; and lot sit in the gate of sodom : and lot see they rise up to meet they ; and he bow himself with he face toward the ground ;
and he say , behold now , my lord , turn in , i pray you , into you servant 's house , and tarry all night , and wash you foot , and ye shall rise up early , and go on you way .
and they say , nay ; but we will abide in the street all night .
and he press upon they greatly ; and they turn in unto he , and enter into he house ; and he make they a feast , and do bake unleavened bread , and they do eat .
but before they lay down , the man of the city , even the man of sodom , compass the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and they call unto lot , and say unto he , where be the man which come in to thee this night ? bring they out unto we , that we may know they .
and lot go out at the door unto they , and shut the door after he ,
and say , i pray you , brethren , do not so wickedly .
behold now , i have two daughter which have not know man ; let i , i pray you , bring they out unto you , and do ye to they as be good in you eye : only unto these man do nothing ; for therefore come they under the shadow of my roof .
and they say , stand back .
and they say again , this one fellow come in to sojourn , and he will need be a judge : now will we deal worse with thee , than with they .
and they press sore upon the man , even lot , and come near to break the door .
but the man put forth they hand , and pull lot into the house to they , and shut to the door .
and they smite the man that be at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they weary themselves to find the door .
and the man say unto lot , hast thou here any besides ? son in law , and thy son , and thy daughter , and whatsoever thou hast in the city , bring they out of this place :
for we will destroy this place , because the cry of they be waxen great before the face of the lord ; and the lord have send we to destroy it .
and lot go out , and spake unto he son in law , which marry he daughter , and say , up , get you out of this place ; for the lord will destroy this city .
but he seem as one that mock unto he son in law .
and when the morning arise , then the angel hasten lot , say , arise , take thy wife , and thy two daughter , which be here ; lest thou be consume in the iniquity of the city .
and while he linger , the man lay hold upon he hand , and upon the hand of he wife , and upon the hand of he two daughter ; the lord be merciful unto he : and they bring he forth , and set he without the city .
and it come to pass , when they have bring they forth abroad , that he say , escape for thy life ; look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain , lest thou be consume .
and lot say unto they , oh , not so , my lord :
behold now , thy servant have find grace in thy sight , and thou hast magnify thy mercy , which thou hast shew unto i in save my life ; and i can not escape to the mountain , lest some evil take i , and i die :
behold now , this city be near to flee unto , and it be a little one : oh , let i escape thither , ( be it not a little one ? ) and my soul shall live .
and he say unto he , see , i have accept thee concern this thing also , that i will not overthrow this city , for the which thou hast speak .
haste thee , escape thither ; for i can not do anything till thou be come thither .
therefore the name of the city be call zoar .
the sun be rise upon the earth when lot enter into zoar .
then the lord rain upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven ;
and he overthrow those city , and all the plain , and all the inhabitant of the city , and that which grow upon the ground .
but he wife look back from behind he , and she become a pillar of salt .
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stand before the lord :
and he look toward sodom and gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country go up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it come to pass , when god destroy the city of the plain , that god remember abraham , and send lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrow the city in the which lot dwelt .
and lot go up out of zoar , and dwelt in the mountain , and he two daughter with he ; for he fear to dwell in zoar : and he dwell in a cave , he and he two daughter .
and the firstborn say unto the younger , we father be old , and there be not a man in the earth to come in unto we after the manner of all the earth :
come , let we make we father drink wine , and we will lie with he , that we may preserve seed of we father .
and they make they father drink wine that night : and the firstborn go in , and lay with she father ; and he perceive not when she lay down , nor when she arise .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that the firstborn say unto the younger , behold , i lay yesternight with my father : let we make he drink wine this night also ; and go thou in , and lie with he , that we may preserve seed of we father .
and they make they father drink wine that night also : and the younger arise , and lay with he ; and he perceive not when she lay down , nor when she arise .
thus be both the daughter of lot with child by they father .
and the first bear bare a son , and call he name moab : the same be the father of the moabites unto this day .
and the younger , she also bare a son , and call he name benammi : the same be the father of the child of ammon unto this day .
and abraham journey from thence toward the south country , and dwell between kadesh and shur , and sojourn in gerar .
and abraham say of sarah he wife , she be my sister : and abimelech king of gerar send , and take sarah .
but god come to abimelech in a dream by night , and say to he , behold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast take ; for she be a man 's wife .
but abimelech have not come near she : and he say , lord , wilt thou slay also a righteous nation ?
said he not unto i , she be my sister ? and she , even she herself say , he be my brother : in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hand have i do this .
and god say unto he in a dream , yea , i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart ; for i also withhold thee from sin against i : therefore suffer i thee not to touch she .
now therefore restore the man he wife ; for he be a prophet , and he shall pray for thee , and thou shalt live : and if thou restore she not , know thou that thou shalt surely die , thou , and all that be thine .
therefore abimelech rise early in the morning , and call all he servant , and tell all these thing in they ear : and the man be sore afraid .
then abimelech call abraham , and say unto he , what hast thou do unto we ? and what have i offend thee , that thou hast bring on i and on my kingdom a great sin ? thou hast do deed unto i that ought not to be do .
and abimelech say unto abraham , what sawest thou , that thou hast do this thing ?
and abraham say , because i think , surely the fear of god be not in this place ; and they will slay i for my wife 's sake .
and yet indeed she be my sister ; she be the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she become my wife .
and it come to pass , when god cause i to wander from my father 's house , that i say unto she , this be thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto i ; at every place whither we shall come , say of i , he be my brother .
and abimelech take sheep , and ox , and manservant , and womenservant , and give they unto abraham , and restore he sarah he wife .
and abimelech say , behold , my land be before thee : dwell where it pleaseth thee .
and unto sarah he say , behold , i have give thy brother a thousand piece of silver : behold , he be to thee a covering of the eye , unto all that be with thee , and with all other : thus she be reprove .
so abraham pray unto god : and god heal abimelech , and he wife , and he maidservant ; and they bare child .
for the lord have fast close up all the womb of the house of abimelech , because of sarah abraham 's wife .
and the lord visit sarah as he have say , and the lord do unto sarah as he have speak .
for sarah conceive , and bare abraham a son in he old age , at the set time of which god have speak to he .
and abraham call the name of he son that be bear unto he , whom sarah bare to he , isaac .
and abraham circumcise he son isaac be eight day old , as god have command he .
and abraham be a hundred year old , when he son isaac be bear unto he .
and sarah say , god have make i to laugh , so that all that hear will laugh with i .
and she say , who would have say unto abraham , that sarah should have give child suck ? for i have bear he a son in he old age .
and the child grow , and be wean : and abraham make a great feast the same day that isaac be wean .
and sarah see the son of hagar the egyptian , which she have bear unto abraham , mock .
wherefore she say unto abraham , cast out this bondwoman and she son : for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with isaac .
and the thing be very grievous in abraham 's sight because of he son .
and god say unto abraham , let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad , and because of thy bondwoman ; in all that sarah have say unto thee , hearken unto she voice ; for in isaac shall thy seed be call .
and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation , because he be thy seed .
and abraham rise up early in the morning , and take bread , and a bottle of water , and give it unto hagar , put it on she shoulder , and the child , and send she away : and she depart , and wander in the wilderness of beersheba .
and the water be spend in the bottle , and she cast the child under one of the shrub .
and she go , and sit she down over against he a good way off , as it be a bow shot : for she say , let i not see the death of the child .
and she sit over against he , and lift up she voice , and weep .
and god hear the voice of the lad ; and the angel of god call to hagar out of heaven , and say unto she , what aileth thee , hagar ? fear not ; for god have hear the voice of the lad where he be .
arise , lift up the lad , and hold he in thine hand ; for i will make he a great nation .
and god open she eye , and she see a well of water ; and she go , and fill the bottle with water , and give the lad drink .
and god be with the lad ; and he grow , and dwelt in the wilderness , and become a archer .
and he dwell in the wilderness of paran : and he mother take he a wife out of the land of egypt .
and it come to pass at that time , that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of he host spake unto abraham , say , god be with thee in all that thou doest :
now therefore swear unto i here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with i , nor with my son , nor with my son 's son : but accord to the kindness that i have do unto thee , thou shalt do unto i , and to the land wherein thou hast sojourn .
and abraham say , i will swear .
and abraham reprove abimelech because of a well of water , which abimelech 's servant have violently take away .
and abimelech say , i wot not who have do this thing : neither do thou tell i , neither yet hear i of it , but to day .
and abraham take sheep and ox , and give they unto abimelech ; and both of they make a covenant .
and abraham set seven ewe lamb of the flock by themselves .
and abimelech say unto abraham , what mean these seven ewe lamb which thou hast set by themselves ?
and he say , for these seven ewe lamb shalt thou take of my hand , that they may be a witness unto i , that i have dig this well .
wherefore he call that place beersheba ; because there they sware both of they .
thus they make a covenant at beersheba : then abimelech rise up , and phichol the chief captain of he host , and they return into the land of the philistines .
and abraham plant a grove in beersheba , and call there on the name of the lord , the everlasting god .
and abraham sojourn in the philistine ' land many day .
and it come to pass after these thing , that god do tempt abraham , and say unto he , abraham : and he say , behold , here i be .
and he say , take now thy son , thine only son isaac , whom thou lovest , and get thee into the land of moriah ; and offer he there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountain which i will tell thee of .
and abraham rise up early in the morning , and saddle he ass , and take two of he young man with he , and isaac he son , and cleave the wood for the burnt offering , and rise up , and go unto the place of which god have tell he .
then on the third day abraham lift up he eye , and see the place afar off .
and abraham say unto he young man , abide ye here with the ass ; and i and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you .
and abraham take the wood of the burnt offering , and lay it upon isaac he son ; and he take the fire in he hand , and a knife ; and they go both of they together .
and isaac spake unto abraham he father , and say , my father : and he say , here be i , my son .
and he say , behold the fire and the wood : but where be the lamb for a burnt offering ?
and abraham say , my son , god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering : so they go both of they together .
and they come to the place which god have tell he of ; and abraham build a altar there , and lay the wood in order , and bind isaac he son , and lay he on the altar upon the wood .
and abraham stretch forth he hand , and take the knife to slay he son .
and the angel of the lord call unto he out of heaven , and say , abraham , abraham : and he say , here be i.
and he say , lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto he : for now i know that thou fearest god , see thou hast not withhold thy son , thine only son from i .
and abraham lift up he eye , and look , and behold behind he a ram catch in a thicket by he horn : and abraham go and take the ram , and offer he up for a burnt offering in the stead of he son .
and abraham call the name of that place jehovahjireh : as it be say to this day , in the mount of the lord it shall be see .
and the angel of the lord call unto abraham out of heaven the second time ,
and say , by myself have i swear , saith the lord , for because thou hast do this thing , and hast not withhold thy son , thine only son :
that in blessing i will bless thee , and in multiply i will multiply thy seed as the star of the heaven , and as the sand which be upon the sea shore ; and thy seed shall possess the gate of he enemy ;
and in thy seed shall all the nation of the earth be bless ; because thou hast obey my voice .
so abraham return unto he young man , and they rise up and go together to beersheba ; and abraham dwelt at beersheba .
and it come to pass after these thing , that it be tell abraham , say , behold , milcah , she have also bear child unto thy brother nahor ;
huz he firstborn , and buz he brother , and kemuel the father of aram ,
and chesed , and hazo , and pildash , and jidlaph , and bethuel .
and bethuel beget rebekah : these eight milcah do bear to nahor , abraham 's brother .
and he concubine , whose name be reumah , she bare also tebah , and gaham , and thahash , and maachah .
and sarah be a hundred and seven and twenty year old : these be the year of the life of sarah .
and sarah die in kirjatharba ; the same be hebron in the land of canaan : and abraham come to mourn for sarah , and to weep for she .
and abraham stand up from before he dead , and spake unto the son of heth , say ,
i be a stranger and a sojourner with you : give i a possession of a buryingplace with you , that i may bury my dead out of my sight .
and the child of heth answer abraham , say unto he ,
hear we , my lord : thou art a mighty prince among we : in the choice of we sepulchre bury thy dead ; none of we shall withhold from thee he sepulchre , but that thou mayest bury thy dead .
and abraham stand up , and bow himself to the people of the land , even to the child of heth .
and he commune with they , say , if it be you mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear i , and intreat for i to ephron the son of zohar ,
that he may give i the cave of machpelah , which he have , which be in the end of he field ; for as much money as it be worth he shall give it i for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you .
and ephron dwelt among the child of heth : and ephron the hittite answer abraham in the audience of the child of heth , even of all that go in at the gate of he city , say ,
nay , my lord , hear i : the field give i thee , and the cave that be therein , i give it thee ; in the presence of the son of my people give i it thee : bury thy dead .
and abraham bow down himself before the people of the land .
and he speak unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land , say , but if thou wilt give it , i pray thee , hear i : i will give thee money for the field ; take it of i , and i will bury my dead there .
and ephron answer abraham , say unto he ,
my lord , hearken unto i : the land be worth four hundred shekel of silver ; what be that betwixt i and thee ? bury therefore thy dead .
and abraham hearken unto ephron ; and abraham weigh to ephron the silver , which he have name in the audience of the son of heth , four hundred shekel of silver , current money with the merchant .
and the field of ephron , which be in machpelah , which be before mamre , the field , and the cave which be therein , and all the tree that be in the field , that be in all the border round about , be make sure
unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the child of heth , before all that go in at the gate of he city .
and after this , abraham bury sarah he wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre : the same be hebron in the land of canaan .
and the field , and the cave that be therein , be make sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the son of heth .
and abraham be old , and well stricken in age : and the lord have bless abraham in all thing .
and abraham say unto he eldest servant of he house , that rule over all that he have , put , i pray thee , thy hand under my thigh :
and i will make thee swear by the lord , the god of heaven , and the god of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughter of the canaanites , among whom i dwell :
but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son isaac .
and the servant say unto he , peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow i unto this land : must i need bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest ?
and abraham say unto he , beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again .
the lord god of heaven , which take i from my father 's house , and from the land of my kindred , and which speak unto i , and that sware unto i , say , unto thy seed will i give this land ; he shall send he angel before thee , and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence .
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again .
and the servant put he hand under the thigh of abraham he master , and sware to he concern that matter .
and the servant take ten camel of the camel of he master , and depart ; for all the goods of he master be in he hand : and he arise , and go to mesopotamia , unto the city of nahor .
and he make he camel to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that woman go out to draw water .
and he say , o lord god of my master abraham , i pray thee , send i good speed this day , and shew kindness unto my master abraham .
behold , i stand here by the well of water ; and the daughter of the man of the city come out to draw water :
and let it come to pass , that the damsel to whom i shall say , let down thy pitcher , i pray thee , that i may drink ; and she shall say , drink , and i will give thy camel drink also : let the same be she that thou hast appoint for thy servant isaac ; and thereby shall i know that thou hast shew kindness unto my master .
and it come to pass , before he have do speaking , that , behold , rebekah come out , who be bear to bethuel , son of milcah , the wife of nahor , abraham 's brother , with she pitcher upon she shoulder .
and the damsel be very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither have any man know she : and she go down to the well , and fill she pitcher , and come up .
and the servant run to meet she , and say , let i , i pray thee , drink a little water of thy pitcher .
and she say , drink , my lord : and she hast , and let down she pitcher upon she hand , and give he drink .
and when she have do give he drink , she say , i will draw water for thy camel also , until they have do drinking .
and she hast , and empty she pitcher into the trough , and run again unto the well to draw water , and draw for all he camel .
and the man wonder at she hold he peace , to wit whether the lord have make he journey prosperous or not .
and it come to pass , as the camel have do drinking , that the man take a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelet for she hand of ten shekel weight of gold ;
and say , whose daughter art thou ? tell i , i pray thee : be there room in thy father 's house for we to lodge in ?
and she say unto he , i be the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah , which she bare unto nahor .
she say moreover unto he , we have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in .
and the man bow down he head , and worship the lord .
and he say , blessed be the lord god of my master abraham , who have not leave destitute my master of he mercy and he truth : i be in the way , the lord lead i to the house of my master 's brethren .
and the damsel run , and tell they of she mother 's house these thing .
and rebekah have a brother , and he name be laban : and laban run out unto the man , unto the well .
and it come to pass , when he see the earring and bracelet upon he sister 's hand , and when he hear the word of rebekah he sister , say , thus speak the man unto i ; that he come unto the man ; and , behold , he stand by the camel at the well .
and he say , come in , thou bless of the lord ; wherefore standest thou without ? for i have prepare the house , and room for the camel .
and the man come into the house : and he ungird he camel , and give straw and provender for the camel , and water to wash he foot , and the man 's foot that be with he .
and there be set meat before he to eat : but he say , i will not eat , until i have tell mine errand .
and he say , speak on .
and he say , i be abraham 's servant .
and the lord have bless my master greatly ; and he be become great : and he have give he flock , and herd , and silver , and gold , and manservant , and maidservant , and camel , and ass .
and sarah my master 's wife bare a son to my master when she be old : and unto he have he give all that he have .
and my master make i swear , say , thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughter of the canaanites , in whose land i dwell :
but thou shalt go unto my father 's house , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son .
and i say unto my master , peradventure the woman will not follow i .
and he say unto i , the lord , before whom i walk , will send he angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father 's house :
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath , when thou comest to my kindred ; and if they give not thee one , thou shalt be clear from my oath .
and i come this day unto the well , and say , o lord god of my master abraham , if now thou do prosper my way which i go :
behold , i stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water , and i say to she , give i , i pray thee , a little water of thy pitcher to drink ;
and she say to i , both drink thou , and i will also draw for thy camel : let the same be the woman whom the lord have appoint out for my master 's son .
and before i have do speaking in mine heart , behold , rebekah come forth with she pitcher on she shoulder ; and she go down unto the well , and draw water : and i say unto she , let i drink , i pray thee .
and she make haste , and let down she pitcher from she shoulder , and say , drink , and i will give thy camel drink also : so i drink , and she make the camel drink also .
and i ask she , and say , whose daughter art thou ?
and she say , the daughter of bethuel , nahor 's son , whom milcah bare unto he : and i put the earring upon she face , and the bracelet upon she hand .
and i bow down my head , and worship the lord , and bless the lord god of my master abraham , which have lead i in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter unto he son .
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell i : and if not , tell i ; that i may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
then laban and bethuel answer and say , the thing proceedeth from the lord : we can not speak unto thee bad or good .
behold , rebekah be before thee , take she , and go , and let she be thy master 's son 's wife , as the lord have speak .
and it come to pass , that , when abraham 's servant hear they word , he worship the lord , bow himself to the earth .
and the servant bring forth jewel of silver , and jewel of gold , and raiment , and give they to rebekah : he give also to she brother and to she mother precious thing .
and they do eat and drink , he and the man that be with he , and tarry all night ; and they rise up in the morning , and he say , send i away unto my master .
and she brother and she mother say , let the damsel abide with we a few day , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
and he say unto they , hinder i not , see the lord have prosper my way ; send i away that i may go to my master .
and they say , we will call the damsel , and enquire at she mouth .
and they call rebekah , and say unto she , wilt thou go with this man ?
and she say , i will go .
and they send away rebekah they sister , and she nurse , and abraham 's servant , and he man .
and they bless rebekah , and say unto she , thou art we sister , be thou the mother of thousand of million , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate they .
and rebekah arise , and she damsel , and they ride upon the camel , and follow the man : and the servant take rebekah , and go he way .
and isaac come from the way of the well lahairous ; for he dwell in the south country .
and isaac go out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lift up he eye , and see , and , behold , the camel be come .
and rebekah lift up she eye , and when she see isaac , she light off the camel .
for she have say unto the servant , what man be this that walketh in the field to meet we ?
and the servant have say , it be my master : therefore she take a vail , and cover herself .
and the servant tell isaac all thing that he have do .
and isaac bring she into he mother sarah 's tent , and take rebekah , and she become he wife ; and he love she : and isaac be comfort after he mother 's death .
then again abraham take a wife , and she name be keturah .
and she bare he zimran , and jokshan , and medan , and midian , and ishbak , and shuah .
and jokshan beget sheba , and dedan .
and the son of dedan be asshurim , and letushim , and leummim .
and the son of midian ; ephah , and epher , and hanoch , and abidah , and eldaah .
all these be the child of keturah .
and abraham give all that he have unto isaac .
but unto the son of the concubine , which abraham have , abraham give gift , and send they away from isaac he son , while he yet live , eastward , unto the east country .
and these be the day of the year of abraham 's life which he live , a hundred threescore and fifteen year .
then abraham give up the ghost , and die in a good old age , a old man , and full of year ; and be gather to he people .
and he son isaac and ishmael bury he in the cave of machpelah , in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite , which be before mamre ;
the field which abraham purchase of the son of heth : there be abraham bury , and sarah he wife .
and it come to pass after the death of abraham , that god bless he son isaac ; and isaac dwelt by the well lahairous .
now these be the generation of ishmael , abraham 's son , whom hagar the egyptian , sarah 's handmaid , bare unto abraham :
and these be the name of the son of ishmael , by they name , accord to they generation : the firstborn of ishmael , nebajoth ; and kedar , and adbeel , and mibsam ,
and mishma , and dumah , and massa ,
hadar , and tema , jetur , naphish , and kedemah :
these be the son of ishmael , and these be they name , by they town , and by they castle ; twelve prince accord to they nation .
and these be the year of the life of ishmael , a hundred and thirty and seven year : and he give up the ghost and die ; and be gather unto he people .
and they dwell from havilah unto shur , that be before egypt , as thou goest toward assyria : and he die in the presence of all he brethren .
and these be the generation of isaac , abraham 's son : abraham beget isaac :
and isaac be forty year old when he take rebekah to wife , the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram , the sister to laban the syrian .
and isaac intreat the lord for he wife , because she be barren : and the lord be intreat of he , and rebekah he wife conceive .
and the child struggle together within she ; and she say , if it be so , why be i thus ?
and she go to enquire of the lord .
and the lord say unto she , two nation be in thy womb , and two manner of people shall be separate from thy bowels ; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people ; and the elder shall serve the younger .
and when she day to be deliver be fulfil , behold , there be twin in she womb .
and the first come out red , all over like a hairy garment ; and they call he name esau .
and after that come he brother out , and he hand take hold on esau 's heel ; and he name be call jacob : and isaac be threescore year old when she bare they .
and the boy grow : and esau be a cunning hunter , a man of the field ; and jacob be a plain man , dwelling in tent .
and isaac love esau , because he do eat of he venison : but rebekah love jacob .
and jacob sod pottage : and esau come from the field , and he be faint :
and esau say to jacob , feed i , i pray thee , with that same red pottage ; for i be faint : therefore be he name call edom .
and jacob say , sell i this day thy birthright .
and esau say , behold , i be at the point to die : and what profit shall this birthright do to i ?
and jacob say , swear to i this day ; and he sware unto he : and he sell he birthright unto jacob .
then jacob give esau bread and pottage of lentile ; and he do eat and drink , and rise up , and go he way : thus esau despise he birthright .
and there be a famine in the land , beside the first famine that be in the day of abraham .
and isaac go unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar .
and the lord appear unto he , and say , go not down into egypt ; dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of :
sojourn in this land , and i will be with thee , and will bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto thy seed , i will give all these country , and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father ;
and i will make thy seed to multiply as the star of heaven , and will give unto thy seed all these country ; and in thy seed shall all the nation of the earth be bless ;
because that abraham obey my voice , and keep my charge , my commandment , my statute , and my law .
and isaac dwelt in gerar :
and the man of the place ask he of he wife ; and he say , she be my sister : for he fear to say , she be my wife ; lest , say he , the man of the place should kill i for rebekah ; because she be fair to look upon .
and it come to pass , when he have be there a long time , that abimelech king of the philistines look out at a window , and see , and , behold , isaac be sport with rebekah he wife .
and abimelech call isaac , and say , behold , of a surety she be thy wife : and how saidst thou , she be my sister ?
and isaac say unto he , because i say , lest i die for she .
and abimelech say , what be this thou hast do unto we ? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife , and thou shouldest have bring guiltiness upon we .
and abimelech charge all he people , say , he that toucheth this man or he wife shall surely be put to death .
then isaac sow in that land , and receive in the same year a hundredfold : and the lord bless he .
and the man wax great , and go forward , and grow until he become very great :
for he have possession of flock , and possession of herd , and great store of servant : and the philistines envy he .
for all the well which he father 's servant have dig in the day of abraham he father , the philistines have stop they , and fill they with earth .
and abimelech say unto isaac , go from we ; for thou art much mightier than we .
and isaac depart thence , and pitch he tent in the valley of gerar , and dwelt there .
and isaac dig again the well of water , which they have dig in the day of abraham he father ; for the philistines have stop they after the death of abraham : and he call they name after the name by which he father have call they .
and isaac 's servant dig in the valley , and find there a well of spring water .
and the herdman of gerar do strive with isaac 's herdman , say , the water be ours : and he call the name of the well esek ; because they strive with he .
and they dig another well , and strove for that also : and he call the name of it sitnah .
and he remove from thence , and dig another well ; and for that they strive not : and he call the name of it rehoboth ; and he say , for now the lord have make room for we , and we shall be fruitful in the land .
and he go up from thence to beersheba .
and the lord appear unto he the same night , and say , i be the god of abraham thy father : fear not , for i be with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant abraham 's sake .
and he build a altar there , and call upon the name of the lord , and pitch he tent there : and there isaac 's servant dig a well .
then abimelech go to he from gerar , and ahuzzath one of he friend , and phichol the chief captain of he army .
and isaac say unto they , wherefore come ye to i , see ye hate i , and have send i away from you ?
and they say , we see certainly that the lord be with thee : and we say , let there be now a oath betwixt we , even betwixt we and thee , and let we make a covenant with thee ;
that thou wilt do we no hurt , as we have not touch thee , and as we have do unto thee nothing but good , and have send thee away in peace : thou art now the bless of the lord .
and he make they a feast , and they do eat and drink .
and they rise up betime in the morning , and sware one to another : and isaac send they away , and they depart from he in peace .
and it come to pass the same day , that isaac 's servant come , and tell he concern the well which they have dig , and say unto he , we have find water .
and he call it shebah : therefore the name of the city be beersheba unto this day .
and esau be forty year old when he take to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite , and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite :
which be a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah .
and it come to pass , that when isaac be old , and he eye be dim , so that he could not see , he call esau he eldest son , and say unto he , my son : and he say unto he , behold , here be i.
and he say , behold now , i be old , i know not the day of my death :
now therefore take , i pray thee , thy weapon , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take i some venison ;
and make i savoury meat , such as i love , and bring it to i , that i may eat ; that my soul may bless thee before i die .
and rebekah hear when isaac spake to esau he son .
and esau go to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
and rebekah spake unto jacob she son , say , behold , i hear thy father speak unto esau thy brother , say ,
bring i venison , and make i savoury meat , that i may eat , and bless thee before the lord before my death .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice accord to that which i command thee .
go now to the flock , and fetch i from thence two good kid of the goat ; and i will make they savoury meat for thy father , such as he loveth :
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before he death .
and jacob say to rebekah he mother , behold , esau my brother be a hairy man , and i be a smooth man :
my father peradventure will feel i , and i shall seem to he as a deceiver ; and i shall bring a curse upon i , and not a blessing .
and he mother say unto he , upon i be thy curse , my son : only obey my voice , and go fetch i they .
and he go , and fetch , and bring they to he mother : and he mother make savoury meat , such as he father love .
and rebekah take goodly raiment of she eldest son esau , which be with she in the house , and put they upon jacob she younger son :
and she put the skin of the kid of the goat upon he hand , and upon the smooth of he neck :
and she give the savoury meat and the bread , which she have prepare , into the hand of she son jacob .
and he come unto he father , and say , my father : and he say , here be i ; who art thou , my son ?
and jacob say unto he father , i be esau thy first bear ; i have do accord as thou badest i : arise , i pray thee , sit and eat of my venison , that thy soul may bless i .
and isaac say unto he son , how be it that thou hast find it so quickly , my son ?
and he say , because the lord thy god bring it to i .
and isaac say unto jacob , come near , i pray thee , that i may feel thee , my son , whether thou be my very son esau or not .
and jacob go near unto isaac he father ; and he feel he , and say , the voice be jacob 's voice , but the hand be the hand of esau .
and he discern he not , because he hand be hairy , as he brother esau 's hand : so he bless he .
and he say , art thou my very son esau ?
and he say , i be .
and he say , bring it near to i , and i will eat of my son 's venison , that my soul may bless thee .
and he bring it near to he , and he do eat : and he bring he wine , and he drink .
and he father isaac say unto he , come near now , and kiss i , my son .
and he come near , and kiss he : and he smell the smell of he raiment , and bless he , and say , see , the smell of my son be as the smell of a field which the lord have bless :
therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven , and the fatness of the earth , and plenty of corn and wine :
let people serve thee , and nation bow down to thee : be lord over thy brethren , and let thy mother 's son bow down to thee : curse be every one that curseth thee , and bless be he that blesseth thee .
and it come to pass , as soon as isaac have make a end of blessing jacob , and jacob be yet scarce go out from the presence of isaac he father , that esau he brother come in from he hunting .
and he also have make savoury meat , and bring it unto he father , and say unto he father , let my father arise , and eat of he son 's venison , that thy soul may bless i .
and isaac he father say unto he , who art thou ?
and he say , i be thy son , thy firstborn esau .
and isaac tremble very exceedingly , and say , who ? where be he that have take venison , and bring it i , and i have eat of all before thou camest , and have bless he ? yea , and he shall be bless .
and when esau hear the word of he father , he cry with a great and exceed bitter cry , and say unto he father , bless i , even i also , o my father .
and he say , thy brother come with subtilty , and have take away thy blessing .
and he say , be not he rightly name jacob ? for he have supplant i these two time : he take away my birthright ; and , behold , now he have take away my blessing .
and he say , hast thou not reserve a blessing for i ?
and isaac answer and say unto esau , behold , i have make he thy lord , and all he brethren have i give to he for servant ; and with corn and wine have i sustain he : and what shall i do now unto thee , my son ?
and esau say unto he father , hast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless i , even i also , o my father .
and esau lift up he voice , and weep .
and isaac he father answer and say unto he , behold , thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break he yoke from off thy neck .
and esau hate jacob because of the blessing wherewith he father bless he : and esau say in he heart , the day of mourning for my father be at hand ; then will i slay my brother jacob .
and these word of esau she elder son be tell to rebekah : and she send and call jacob she younger son , and say unto he , behold , thy brother esau , as touching thee , doth comfort himself , purpose to kill thee .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to laban my brother to haran ;
and tarry with he a few day , until thy brother 's fury turn away ;
until thy brother 's anger turn away from thee , and he forget that which thou hast do to he : then i will send , and fetch thee from thence : why should i be deprive also of you both in one day ?
and rebekah say to isaac , i be weary of my life because of the daughter of heth : if jacob take a wife of the daughter of heth , such as these which be of the daughter of the land , what good shall my life do i ?
and isaac call jacob , and bless he , and charge he , and say unto he , thou shalt not take a wife of the daughter of canaan .
arise , go to padanaram , to the house of bethuel thy mother 's father ; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughter of laban thy mother 's brother .
and god almighty bless thee , and make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a multitude of people ;
and give thee the blessing of abraham , to thee , and to thy seed with thee ; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger , which god give unto abraham .
and isaac send away jacob : and he go to padanaram unto laban , son of bethuel the syrian , the brother of rebekah , jacob 's and esau 's mother .
when esau see that isaac have bless jacob , and send he away to padanaram , to take he a wife from thence ; and that as he bless he he give he a charge , say , thou shalt not take a wife of the daughter of canaan ;
and that jacob obey he father and he mother , and be go to padanaram ;
and esau see that the daughter of canaan please not isaac he father ;
then go esau unto ishmael , and take unto the wife which he have mahalath the daughter of ishmael abraham 's son , the sister of nebajoth , to be he wife .
and jacob go out from beersheba , and go toward haran .
and he light upon a certain place , and tarry there all night , because the sun be set ; and he take of the stone of that place , and put they for he pillow , and lay down in that place to sleep .
and he dream , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reach to heaven : and behold the angel of god ascend and descend on it .
and , behold , the lord stand above it , and say , i be the lord god of abraham thy father , and the god of isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will i give it , and to thy seed ;
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in thee and in thy seed shall all the family of the earth be bless .
and , behold , i be with thee , and will keep thee in all place whither thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for i will not leave thee , until i have do that which i have speak to thee of .
and jacob awake out of he sleep , and he say , surely the lord be in this place ; and i know it not .
and he be afraid , and say , how dreadful be this place ! this be none other but the house of god , and this be the gate of heaven .
and jacob rise up early in the morning , and take the stone that he have put for he pillow , and set it up for a pillar , and pour oil upon the top of it .
and he call the name of that place bethel : but the name of that city be call luz at the first .
and jacob vow a vow , say , if god will be with i , and will keep i in this way that i go , and will give i bread to eat , and raiment to put on ,
so that i come again to my father 's house in peace ; then shall the lord be my god :
and this stone , which i have set for a pillar , shall be god 's house : and of all that thou shalt give i i will surely give the tenth unto thee .
then jacob go on he journey , and come into the land of the people of the east .
and he look , and behold a well in the field , and , lo , there be three flock of sheep lie by it ; for out of that well they water the flock : and a great stone be upon the well 's mouth .
and thither be all the flock gather : and they roll the stone from the well 's mouth , and water the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in he place .
and jacob say unto they , my brethren , whence be ye ?
and they say , of haran be we .
and he say unto they , know ye laban the son of nahor ?
and they say , we know he .
and he say unto they , be he well ?
and they say , he be well : and , behold , rachel he daughter cometh with the sheep .
and he say , lo , it be yet high day , neither be it time that the cattle should be gather together : water ye the sheep , and go and feed they .
and they say , we can not , until all the flock be gather together , and till they roll the stone from the well 's mouth ; then we water the sheep .
and while he yet speak with they , rachel come with she father 's sheep : for she keep they .
and it come to pass , when jacob see rachel the daughter of laban he mother 's brother , and the sheep of laban he mother 's brother , that jacob go near , and roll the stone from the well 's mouth , and water the flock of laban he mother 's brother .
and jacob kiss rachel , and lift up he voice , and weep .
and jacob tell rachel that he be she father 's brother , and that he be rebekah 's son : and she run and tell she father .
and it come to pass , when laban hear the tiding of jacob he sister 's son , that he run to meet he , and embrace he , and kiss he , and bring he to he house .
and he tell laban all these thing .
and laban say to he , surely thou art my bone and my flesh .
and he abode with he the space of a month .
and laban say unto jacob , because thou art my brother , shouldest thou therefore serve i for nought ? tell i , what shall thy wages be ?
and laban have two daughter : the name of the elder be leah , and the name of the younger be rachel .
leah be tender eye ; but rachel be beautiful and well favoured .
and jacob love rachel ; and say , i will serve thee seven year for rachel thy younger daughter .
and laban say , it be better that i give she to thee , than that i should give she to another man : abide with i .
and jacob serve seven year for rachel ; and they seem unto he but a few day , for the love he have to she .
and jacob say unto laban , give i my wife , for my day be fulfil , that i may go in unto she .
and laban gather together all the man of the place , and make a feast .
and it come to pass in the evening , that he take leah he daughter , and bring she to he ; and he go in unto she .
and laban give unto he daughter leah zilpah he maid for a handmaid .
and it come to pass , that in the morning , behold , it be leah : and he say to laban , what be this thou hast do unto i ? do not i serve with thee for rachel ? wherefore then hast thou beguile i ?
and laban say , it must not be so do in we country , to give the younger before the firstborn .
fulfil she week , and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with i yet seven other year .
and jacob do so , and fulfil she week : and he give he rachel he daughter to wife also .
and laban give to rachel he daughter bilhah he handmaid to be she maid .
and he go in also unto rachel , and he love also rachel more than leah , and serve with he yet seven other year .
and when the lord see that leah be hate , he open she womb : but rachel be barren .
and leah conceive , and bare a son , and she call he name reuben : for she say , surely the lord have look upon my affliction ; now therefore my husband will love i .
and she conceive again , and bare a son ; and say , because the lord have hear that i be hate , he have therefore give i this son also : and she call he name simeon .
and she conceive again , and bare a son ; and say , now this time will my husband be join unto i , because i have bear he three son : therefore be he name call levi .
and she conceive again , and bare a son : and she say , now will i praise the lord : therefore she call he name judah ; and leave bearing .
and when rachel see that she bare jacob no child , rachel envy she sister ; and say unto jacob , give i child , or else i die .
and jacob 's anger be kindle against rachel : and he say , be i in god 's stead , who have withhold from thee the fruit of the womb ?
and she say , behold my maid bilhah , go in unto she ; and she shall bear upon my knee , that i may also have child by she .
and she give he bilhah she handmaid to wife : and jacob go in unto she .
and bilhah conceive , and bare jacob a son .
and rachel say , god have judge i , and have also hear my voice , and have give i a son : therefore call she he name dan .

and zilpah leah 's maid bare jacob a son .
and leah say , a troop cometh : and she call he name gad .
and zilpah leah 's maid bare jacob a second son .
and leah say , happy be i , for the daughter will call i bless : and she call he name asher .
and reuben go in the day of wheat harvest , and find mandrake in the field , and bring they unto he mother leah .
then rachel say to leah , give i , i pray thee , of thy son 's mandrake .
and she say unto she , be it a small matter that thou hast take my husband ? and wouldest thou take away my son 's mandrake also ?
and rachel say , therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son 's mandrake .
and jacob come out of the field in the evening , and leah go out to meet he , and say , thou must come in unto i ; for surely i have hire thee with my son 's mandrake .
and he lay with she that night .
and god hearken unto leah , and she conceive , and bare jacob the fifth son .
and leah say , god have give i my hire , because i have give my maiden to my husband : and she call he name issachar .
and leah conceive again , and bare jacob the sixth son .

and afterwards she bare a daughter , and call she name dinah .
and god remember rachel , and god hearken to she , and open she womb .
and she conceive , and bare a son ; and say , god have take away my reproach :
and she call he name joseph ; and say , the lord shall add to i another son .
and it come to pass , when rachel have bear joseph , that jacob say unto laban , send i away , that i may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
give i my wife and my child , for whom i have serve thee , and let i go : for thou knowest my service which i have do thee .
and laban say unto he , i pray thee , if i have find favour in thine eye , tarry : for i have learn by experience that the lord have bless i for thy sake .
and he say , appoint i thy wages , and i will give it .
and he say unto he , thou knowest how i have serve thee , and how thy cattle be with i .
for it be little which thou hadst before i come , and it be now increase unto a multitude ; and the lord have bless thee since my come : and now when shall i provide for mine own house also ?
and he say , what shall i give thee ?
and jacob say , thou shalt not give i any thing : if thou wilt do this thing for i , i will again feed and keep thy flock .
i will pass through all thy flock to day , remove from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle , and all the brown cattle among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goat : and of such shall be my hire .
so shall my righteousness answer for i in time to come , when it shall come for my hire before thy face : every one that be not speckled and spot among the goat , and brown among the sheep , that shall be count steal with i .
and laban say , behold , i would it might be accord to thy word .
and he remove that day the he goat that be ringstraked and spotted , and all the she goat that be speckled and spotted , and every one that have some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and give they into the hand of he son .
and he set three day ' journey betwixt himself and jacob : and jacob feed the rest of laban 's flock .
and jacob take he rod of green poplar , and of the hazel and chestnut tree ; and pill white strake in they , and make the white appear which be in the rod .
and he set the rod which he have pill before the flock in the gutter in the water trough when the flock come to drink , that they should conceive when they come to drink .
and the flock conceive before the rod , and bring forth cattle ringstrake , speckled , and spot .
and jacob do separate the lamb , and set the face of the flock toward the ringstraked , and all the brown in the flock of laban ; and he put he own flock by themselves , and put they not unto laban 's cattle .
and it come to pass , whensoever the stronger cattle do conceive , that jacob lay the rod before the eye of the cattle in the gutter , that they might conceive among the rod .
but when the cattle be feeble , he put they not in : so the feebler be laban 's , and the stronger jacob 's .
and the man increase exceedingly , and have much cattle , and maidservant , and manservant , and camel , and ass .
and he hear the word of laban 's son , say , jacob have take away all that be we father 's ; and of that which be we father 's have he get all this glory .
and jacob behold the countenance of laban , and , behold , it be not toward he as before .
and the lord say unto jacob , return unto the land of thy father , and to thy kindred ; and i will be with thee .
and jacob send and call rachel and leah to the field unto he flock ,
and say unto they , i see you father 's countenance , that it be not toward i as before ; but the god of my father have be with i .
and ye know that with all my power i have serve you father .
and you father have deceive i , and change my wages ten time ; but god suffer he not to hurt i .
if he say thus , the speckled shall be thy wages ; then all the cattle bare speckled : and if he say thus , the ringstraked shall be thy hire ; then bare all the cattle ringstrake .
thus god have take away the cattle of you father , and give they to i .
and it come to pass at the time that the cattle conceive , that i lift up mine eye , and see in a dream , and , behold , the ram which leap upon the cattle be ringstraked , speckled , and grisle .
and the angel of god speak unto i in a dream , say , jacob : and i say , here be i.
and he say , lift up now thine eye , and see , all the ram which leap upon the cattle be ringstraked , speckled , and grisle : for i have see all that laban doeth unto thee .
i be the god of bethel , where thou anointedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow unto i : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kindred .
and rachel and leah answer and say unto he , be there yet any portion or inheritance for we in we father 's house ?
be we not count of he stranger ? for he have sell we , and have quite devour also we money .
for all the riches which god have take from we father , that be ours , and we child 's : now then , whatsoever god have say unto thee , do .
then jacob rise up , and set he son and he wife upon camel ;
and he carry away all he cattle , and all he goods which he have get , the cattle of he get , which he have get in padanaram , for to go to isaac he father in the land of canaan .
and laban go to shear he sheep : and rachel have steal the image that be she father 's .
and jacob steal away unawares to laban the syrian , in that he tell he not that he flee .
so he flee with all that he have ; and he rise up , and pass over the river , and set he face toward the mount gilead .
and it be tell laban on the third day that jacob be flee .
and he take he brethren with he , and pursue after he seven day ' journey ; and they overtake he in the mount gilead .
and god come to laban the syrian in a dream by night , and say unto he , take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad .
then laban overtook jacob .
now jacob have pitch he tent in the mount : and laban with he brethren pitch in the mount of gilead .
and laban say to jacob , what hast thou do , that thou hast steal away unaware to i , and carry away my daughter , as captive take with the sword ?
wherefore didst thou flee away secretly , and steal away from i ; and do not tell i , that i might have send thee away with mirth , and with song , with tabret , and with harp ?
and hast not suffer i to kiss my son and my daughter ? thou hast now do foolishly in so do .
it be in the power of my hand to do you hurt : but the god of you father speak unto i yesternight , say , take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad .
and now , though thou wouldest need be go , because thou sore longedst after thy father 's house , yet wherefore hast thou steal my god ?
and jacob answer and say to laban , because i be afraid : for i say , peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughter from i .
with whomsoever thou findest thy god , let he not live : before we brethren discern thou what be thine with i , and take it to thee .
for jacob know not that rachel have steal they .
and laban go into jacob 's tent , and into leah 's tent , and into the two maidservant ' tent ; but he find they not .
then go he out of leah 's tent , and enter into rachel 's tent .
now rachel have take the image , and put they in the camel 's furniture , and sit upon they .
and laban search all the tent , but find they not .
and she say to she father , let it not displease my lord that i can not rise up before thee ; for the custom of woman be upon i .
and he search , but find not the image .
and jacob be wroth , and chode with laban : and jacob answer and say to laban , what be my trespass ? what be my sin , that thou hast so hotly pursue after i ?
whereas thou hast search all my stuff , what hast thou find of all thy household stuff ? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren , that they may judge betwixt we both .
this twenty year have i be with thee ; thy ewe and thy she goat have not cast they young , and the ram of thy flock have i not eat .
that which be tear of beast i bring not unto thee ; i bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether steal by day , or steal by night .
thus i be ; in the day the drought consume i , and the frost by night ; and my sleep depart from mine eye .
thus have i be twenty year in thy house ; i serve thee fourteen year for thy two daughter , and six year for thy cattle : and thou hast change my wages ten time .
except the god of my father , the god of abraham , and the fear of isaac , have be with i , surely thou hadst send i away now empty .
god have see mine affliction and the labour of my hand , and rebuke thee yesternight .
and laban answer and say unto jacob , these daughter be my daughter , and these child be my child , and these cattle be my cattle , and all that thou seest be mine : and what can i do this day unto these my daughter , or unto they child which they have bear ?
now therefore come thou , let we make a covenant , i and thou ; and let it be for a witness between i and thee .
and jacob take a stone , and set it up for a pillar .
and jacob say unto he brethren , gather stone ; and they take stone , and make a heap : and they do eat there upon the heap .
and laban call it jegarsahadutha : but jacob call it galeed .
and laban say , this heap be a witness between i and thee this day .
therefore be the name of it call galeed ;
and mizpah ; for he say , the lord watch between i and thee , when we be absent one from another .
if thou shalt afflict my daughter , or if thou shalt take other wife beside my daughter , no man be with we ; see , god be witness betwixt i and thee .
and laban say to jacob , behold this heap , and behold this pillar , which i have cast betwixt i and thee :
this heap be witness , and this pillar be witness , that i will not pass over this heap to thee , and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto i , for harm .
the god of abraham , and the god of nahor , the god of they father , judge betwixt we .
and jacob sware by the fear of he father isaac .
then jacob offer sacrifice upon the mount , and call he brethren to eat bread : and they do eat bread , and tarry all night in the mount .
and early in the morning laban rise up , and kiss he son and he daughter , and bless they : and laban depart , and return unto he place .
and jacob go on he way , and the angel of god meet he .
and when jacob see they , he say , this be god 's host : and he call the name of that place mahanaim .
and jacob send messenger before he to esau he brother unto the land of seir , the country of edom .
and he command they , say , thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau ; thy servant jacob saith thus , i have sojourn with laban , and stay there until now :
and i have oxen , and ass , flock , and manservant , and womenservant : and i have send to tell my lord , that i may find grace in thy sight .
and the messenger return to jacob , say , we come to thy brother esau , and also he cometh to meet thee , and four hundred man with he .
then jacob be greatly afraid and distressed : and he divide the people that be with he , and the flock , and herd , and the camel , into two band ;
and say , if esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the other company which be leave shall escape .
and jacob say , o god of my father abraham , and god of my father isaac , the lord which saidst unto i , return unto thy country , and to thy kindred , and i will deal well with thee :
i be not worthy of the least of all the mercy , and of all the truth , which thou hast shew unto thy servant ; for with my staff i pass over this jordan ; and now i be become two band .
deliver i , i pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of esau : for i fear he , lest he will come and smite i , and the mother with the child .
and thou saidst , i will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which can not be number for multitude .
and he lodge there that same night ; and take of that which come to he hand a present for esau he brother ;
two hundred she goat , and twenty he goat , two hundred ewe , and twenty ram ,
thirty milch camel with they colt , forty kine , and ten bull , twenty she ass , and ten foal .
and he deliver they into the hand of he servant , every drive by themselves ; and say unto he servant , pass over before i , and put a space betwixt drive and drive .
and he command the foremost , say , when esau my brother meeteth thee , and asketh thee , say , whose art thou ? and whither goest thou ? and whose be these before thee ?
then thou shalt say , they be thy servant jacob 's ; it be a present send unto my lord esau : and , behold , also he be behind we .
and so command he the second , and the third , and all that follow the drove , say , on this manner shall ye speak unto esau , when ye find he .
and say ye moreover , behold , thy servant jacob be behind we .
for he say , i will appease he with the present that goeth before i , and afterward i will see he face ; peradventure he will accept of i .
so go the present over before he : and himself lodge that night in the company .
and he rise up that night , and take he two wife , and he two womenservant , and he eleven son , and pass over the ford jabbok .
and he take they , and send they over the brook , and send over that he have .
and jacob be leave alone ; and there wrestle a man with he until the breaking of the day .
and when he see that he prevail not against he , he touch the hollow of he thigh ; and the hollow of jacob 's thigh be out of joint , as he wrestle with he .
and he say , let i go , for the day breaketh .
and he say , i will not let thee go , except thou bless i .
and he say unto he , what be thy name ?
and he say , jacob .
and he say , thy name shall be call no more jacob , but israel : for as a prince hast thou power with god and with man , and hast prevail .
and jacob ask he , and say , tell i , i pray thee , thy name .
and he say , wherefore be it that thou dost ask after my name ?
and he bless he there .
and jacob call the name of the place peniel : for i have see god face to face , and my life be preserve .
and as he pass over penuel the sun rise upon he , and he halt upon he thigh .
therefore the child of israel eat not of the sinew which shrink , which be upon the hollow of the thigh , unto this day : because he touch the hollow of jacob 's thigh in the sinew that shrink .
and jacob lift up he eye , and look , and , behold , esau come , and with he four hundred man .
and he divide the child unto leah , and unto rachel , and unto the two handmaid .
and he put the handmaid and they child foremost , and leah and she child after , and rachel and joseph hindermost .
and he pass over before they , and bow himself to the ground seven time , until he come near to he brother .
and esau run to meet he , and embrace he , and fall on he neck , and kiss he : and they weep .
and he lift up he eye , and see the woman and the child ; and say , who be those with thee ?
and he say , the child which god have graciously give thy servant .
then the handmaiden come near , they and they child , and they bow themselves .
and leah also with she child come near , and bow themselves : and after come joseph near and rachel , and they bow themselves .
and he say , what meanest thou by all this drive which i meet ?
and he say , these be to find grace in the sight of my lord .
and esau say , i have enough , my brother ; keep that thou hast unto thyself .
and jacob say , nay , i pray thee , if now i have find grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore i have see thy face , as though i have see the face of god , and thou wast please with i .
take , i pray thee , my blessing that be bring to thee ; because god have deal graciously with i , and because i have enough .
and he urge he , and he take it .
and he say , let we take we journey , and let we go , and i will go before thee .
and he say unto he , my lord knoweth that the child be tender , and the flock and herd with young be with i : and if man should overdrive they one day , all the flock will die .
let my lord , i pray thee , pass over before he servant : and i will lead on softly , accord as the cattle that goeth before i and the child be able to endure , until i come unto my lord unto seir .
and esau say , let i now leave with thee some of the folk that be with i .
and he say , what needeth it ? let i find grace in the sight of my lord .
so esau return that day on he way unto seir .
and jacob journey to succoth , and build he a house , and make booth for he cattle : therefore the name of the place be call succoth .
and jacob come to shalem , a city of shechem , which be in the land of canaan , when he come from padanaram ; and pitch he tent before the city .
and he buy a parcel of a field , where he have spread he tent , at the hand of the child of hamor , shechem 's father , for a hundred piece of money .
and he erect there a altar , and call it eleloheisrael .
and dinah the daughter of leah , which she bare unto jacob , go out to see the daughter of the land .
and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite , prince of the country , see she , he take she , and lay with she , and defile she .
and he soul cleave unto dinah the daughter of jacob , and he love the damsel , and spake kindly unto the damsel .
and shechem speak unto he father hamor , say , get i this damsel to wife .
and jacob hear that he have defile dinah he daughter : now he son be with he cattle in the field : and jacob hold he peace until they be come .
and hamor the father of shechem go out unto jacob to commune with he .
and the son of jacob come out of the field when they hear it : and the man be grieve , and they be very wroth , because he have work folly in israel in lie with jacob 's daughter ; which thing ought not to be do .
and hamor commune with they , say , the soul of my son shechem longeth for you daughter : i pray you give she he to wife .
and make ye marriage with we , and give you daughter unto we , and take we daughter unto you .
and ye shall dwell with we : and the land shall be before you ; dwell and trade ye therein , and get you possession therein .
and shechem say unto she father and unto she brethren , let i find grace in you eye , and what ye shall say unto i i will give .
ask i never so much dowry and gift , and i will give accord as ye shall say unto i : but give i the damsel to wife .
and the son of jacob answer shechem and hamor he father deceitfully , and say , because he have defile dinah they sister :
and they say unto they , we can not do this thing , to give we sister to one that be uncircumcised ; for that be a reproach unto we :
but in this will we consent unto you : if ye will be as we be , that every male of you be circumcise ;
then will we give we daughter unto you , and we will take you daughter to we , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if ye will not hearken unto we , to be circumcise ; then will we take we daughter , and we will be go .
and they word pleased hamor , and shechem hamor 's son .
and the young man defer not to do the thing , because he have delight in jacob 's daughter : and he be more honourable than all the house of he father .
and hamor and shechem he son come unto the gate of they city , and commune with the man of they city , say ,
these man be peaceable with we ; therefore let they dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it be large enough for they ; let we take they daughter to we for wife , and let we give they we daughter .
only herein will the man consent unto we for to dwell with we , to be one people , if every male among we be circumcise , as they be circumcise .
shall not they cattle and they substance and every beast of theirs be ours ? only let we consent unto they , and they will dwell with we .
and unto hamor and unto shechem he son hearken all that go out of the gate of he city ; and every male be circumcise , all that go out of the gate of he city .
and it come to pass on the third day , when they be sore , that two of the son of jacob , simeon and levi , dinah 's brethren , take each man he sword , and come upon the city boldly , and slew all the male .
and they slew hamor and shechem he son with the edge of the sword , and take dinah out of shechem 's house , and go out .
the son of jacob come upon the slay , and spoil the city , because they have defile they sister .
they take they sheep , and they ox , and they ass , and that which be in the city , and that which be in the field ,
and all they wealth , and all they little one , and they wife take they captive , and spoil even all that be in the house .
and jacob say to simeon and levi , ye have trouble i to make i to stink among the inhabitant of the land , among the canaanites and the perizzites : and i be few in number , they shall gather themselves together against i , and slay i ; and i shall be destroy , i and my house .
and they say , should he deal with we sister as with a harlot ?
and god say unto jacob , arise , go up to bethel , and dwell there : and make there a altar unto god , that appear unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother .
then jacob say unto he household , and to all that be with he , put away the strange god that be among you , and be clean , and change you garment :
and let we arise , and go up to bethel ; and i will make there a altar unto god , who answer i in the day of my distress , and be with i in the way which i go .
and they give unto jacob all the strange god which be in they hand , and all they earring which be in they ear ; and jacob hide they under the oak which be by shechem .
and they journey : and the terror of god be upon the city that be round about they , and they do not pursue after the son of jacob .
so jacob come to luz , which be in the land of canaan , that be , bethel , he and all the people that be with he .
and he build there a altar , and call the place elbethel : because there god appear unto he , when he flee from the face of he brother .
but deborah rebekah 's nurse die , and she be bury beneath bethel under a oak : and the name of it be call allonbachuth .
and god appear unto jacob again , when he come out of padanaram , and bless he .
and god say unto he , thy name be jacob : thy name shall not be call any more jacob , but israel shall be thy name : and he call he name israel .
and god say unto he , i be god almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nation shall be of thee , and king shall come out of thy loin ;
and the land which i give abraham and isaac , to thee i will give it , and to thy seed after thee will i give the land .
and god go up from he in the place where he talk with he .
and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talk with he , even a pillar of stone : and he pour a drink offering thereon , and he pour oil thereon .
and jacob call the name of the place where god spake with he , bethel .
and they journey from bethel ; and there be but a little way to come to ephrath : and rachel travail , and she have hard labour .
and it come to pass , when she be in hard labour , that the midwife say unto she , fear not ; thou shalt have this son also .
and it come to pass , as she soul be in depart , ( for she die ) that she call he name benoni : but he father call he benjamin .
and rachel die , and be bury in the way to ephrath , which be bethlehem .
and jacob set a pillar upon she grave : that be the pillar of rachel 's grave unto this day .
and israel journey , and spread he tent beyond the tower of edar .
and it come to pass , when israel dwelt in that land , that reuben go and lay with bilhah he father 's concubine : and israel hear it .

joseph , be seventeen year old , be feed the flock with he brethren ; and the lad be with the son of bilhah , and with the son of zilpah , he father 's wife : and joseph bring unto he father they evil report .
now israel love joseph more than all he child , because he be the son of he old age : and he make he a coat of many colour .
and when he brethren see that they father love he more than all he brethren , they hate he , and could not speak peaceably unto he .
and joseph dream a dream , and he tell it he brethren : and they hate he yet the more .
and he say unto they , hear , i pray you , this dream which i have dream :
for , behold , we be bind sheaf in the field , and , lo , my sheaf arise , and also stand upright ; and , behold , you sheaf stand round about , and make obeisance to my sheaf .
and he brethren say to he , shalt thou indeed reign over we ? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over we ?
and they hate he yet the more for he dream , and for he word .
and he dream yet another dream , and tell it he brethren , and say , behold , i have dream a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven star make obeisance to i .
and he tell it to he father , and to he brethren : and he father rebuke he , and say unto he , what be this dream that thou hast dream ?
shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth ?
and he brethren envy he ; but he father observe the say .
and he brethren go to feed they father 's flock in shechem .
and israel say unto joseph , do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem ? come , and i will send thee unto they .
and he say to he , here be i.
and he say to he , go , i pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren , and well with the flock ; and bring i word again .
so he send he out of the vale of hebron , and he come to shechem .
and a certain man find he , and , behold , he be wander in the field : and the man ask he , say , what seekest thou ?
and he say , i seek my brethren : tell i , i pray thee , where they feed they flock .
and the man say , they be depart hence ; for i hear they say , let we go to dothan .
and joseph go after he brethren , and find they in dothan .
and when they see he afar off , even before he come near unto they , they conspire against he to slay he .
and they say one to another , behold , this dreamer cometh .
come now therefore , and let we slay he , and cast he into some pit , and we will say , some evil beast have devour he : and we shall see what will become of he dream .
and reuben hear it , and he deliver he out of they hand ; and say , let we not kill he .
and reuben say unto they , shed no blood , but cast he into this pit that be in the wilderness , and lay no hand upon he ; that he might rid he out of they hand , to deliver he to he father again .
and it come to pass , when joseph be come unto he brethren , that they stript joseph out of he coat , he coat of many colour that be on he ;
and they take he , and cast he into a pit : and the pit be empty , there be no water in it .
and they sit down to eat bread : and they lift up they eye and look , and , behold , a company of ishmeelites come from gilead with they camel bear spicery and balm and myrrh , go to carry it down to egypt .
and judah say unto he brethren , what profit be it if we slay we brother , and conceal he blood ?
come , and let we sell he to the ishmeelites , and let not we hand be upon he ; for he be we brother and we flesh .
and he brethren be content .
then there pass by midianites merchantman ; and they draw and lift up joseph out of the pit , and sell joseph to the ishmeelites for twenty piece of silver : and they bring joseph into egypt .
and reuben return unto the pit ; and , behold , joseph be not in the pit ; and he rent he clothes .
and he return unto he brethren , and say , the child be not ; and i , whither shall i go ?
and they take joseph 's coat , and kill a kid of the goat , and dip the coat in the blood ;
and they send the coat of many colour , and they bring it to they father ; and say , this have we find : know now whether it be thy son 's coat or no. .
and he know it , and say , it be my son 's coat ; a evil beast have devour he ; joseph be without doubt rent in piece .
and jacob rent he clothes , and put sackcloth upon he loin , and mourn for he son many day .
and all he son and all he daughter rise up to comfort he ; but he refuse to be comfort ; and he say , for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning .
thus he father weep for he .
and the midianites sell he into egypt unto potiphar , a officer of pharaoh 's , and captain of the guard .
and it come to pass at that time , that judah go down from he brethren , and turn in to a certain adullamite , whose name be hirah .
and judah see there a daughter of a certain canaanite , whose name be shuah ; and he take she , and go in unto she .
and she conceive , and bare a son ; and he call he name er .
and she conceive again , and bare a son ; and she call he name onan .
and she yet again conceive , and bare a son ; and call he name shelah : and he be at chezib , when she bare he .
and judah take a wife for er he firstborn , whose name be tamar .
and er , judah 's firstborn , be wicked in the sight of the lord ; and the lord slew he .
and judah say unto onan , go in unto thy brother 's wife , and marry she , and raise up seed to thy brother .
and onan know that the seed should not be he ; and it come to pass , when he go in unto he brother 's wife , that he spill it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to he brother .
and the thing which he do displeased the lord : wherefore he slew he also .
then say judah to tamar he daughter in law , remain a widow at thy father 's house , till shelah my son be grow : for he say , lest peradventure he die also , as he brethren do .
and tamar go and dwelt in she father 's house .
and in process of time the daughter of shuah judah 's wife die ; and judah be comfort , and go up unto he sheepshearer to timnath , he and he friend hirah the adullamite .
and it be tell tamar , say , behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear he sheep .
and she put she widow 's garment off from she , and cover she with a vail , and wrap herself , and sit in a open place , which be by the way to timnath ; for she see that shelah be grow , and she be not give unto he to wife .
when judah see she , he think she to be a harlot ; because she have cover she face .
and he turn unto she by the way , and say , go to , i pray thee , let i come in unto thee ; ( for he know not that she be he daughter in law . )
and she say , what wilt thou give i , that thou mayest come in unto i ?
and he say , i will send thee a kid from the flock .
and she say , wilt thou give i a pledge , till thou send it ?
and he say , what pledge shall i give thee ?
and she say , thy signet , and thy bracelet , and thy staff that be in thine hand .
and he give it she , and come in unto she , and she conceive by he .
and she arise , and go away , and lay by she vail from she , and put on the garment of she widowhood .
and judah send the kid by the hand of he friend the adullamite , to receive he pledge from the woman 's hand : but he find she not .
then he ask the man of that place , say , where be the harlot , that be openly by the way side ?
and they say , there be no harlot in this place .
and he return to judah , and say , i can not find she ; and also the man of the place say , that there be no harlot in this place .
and judah say , let she take it to she , lest we be shame : behold , i send this kid , and thou hast not find she .
and it come to pass about three month after , that it be tell judah , say , tamar thy daughter in law have play the harlot ; and also , behold , she be with child by whoredom .
and judah say , bring she forth , and let she be burn .
when she be bring forth , she send to she father in law , say , by the man , whose these be , be i with child : and she say , discern , i pray thee , whose be these , the signet , and bracelet , and staff .
and judah acknowledge they , and say , she have be more righteous than i ; because that i give she not to shelah my son .
and he know she again no more .
and it come to pass in the time of she travail , that , behold , twin be in she womb .
and it come to pass , when she travail , that the one put out he hand : and the midwife take and bind upon he hand a scarlet thread , say , this come out first .
and it come to pass , as he draw back he hand , that , behold , he brother come out : and she say , how hast thou break forth ? this breach be upon thee : therefore he name be call pharez .
and afterward come out he brother , that have the scarlet thread upon he hand : and he name be call zarah .
and joseph be bring down to egypt ; and potiphar , a officer of pharaoh , captain of the guard , a egyptian , buy he of the hand of the ishmeelites , which have bring he down thither .
and the lord be with joseph , and he be a prosperous man ; and he be in the house of he master the egyptian .
and he master see that the lord be with he , and that the lord make all that he do to prosper in he hand .
and joseph find grace in he sight , and he serve he : and he make he overseer over he house , and all that he have he put into he hand .
and it come to pass from the time that he have make he overseer in he house , and over all that he have , that the lord bless the egyptian 's house for joseph 's sake ; and the blessing of the lord be upon all that he have in the house , and in the field .
and he leave all that he have in joseph 's hand ; and he know not ought he have , save the bread which he do eat .
and joseph be a goodly person , and well favoured .
and it come to pass after these thing , that he master 's wife cast she eye upon joseph ; and she say , lie with i .
but he refuse , and say unto he master 's wife , behold , my master wotteth not what be with i in the house , and he have commit all that he have to my hand ;
there be none greater in this house than i ; neither have he keep back any thing from i but thee , because thou art he wife : how then can i do this great wickedness , and sin against god ?
and it come to pass , as she speak to joseph day by day , that he hearken not unto she , to lie by she , or to be with she .
and it come to pass about this time , that joseph go into the house to do he business ; and there be none of the man of the house there within .
and she catch he by he garment , say , lie with i : and he leave he garment in she hand , and flee , and get he out .
and it come to pass , when she see that he have leave he garment in she hand , and be flee forth ,
that she call unto the man of she house , and spake unto they , say , see , he have bring in a hebrew unto we to mock we ; he come in unto i to lie with i , and i cry with a loud voice :
and it come to pass , when he hear that i lift up my voice and cry , that he leave he garment with i , and flee , and get he out .
and she lay up he garment by she , until he lord come home .
and she speak unto he accord to these word , say , the hebrew servant , which thou hast bring unto we , come in unto i to mock i :
and it come to pass , as i lift up my voice and cry , that he leave he garment with i , and flee out .
and it come to pass , when he master hear the word of he wife , which she speak unto he , say , after this manner do thy servant to i ; that he wrath be kindle .
and joseph 's master take he , and put he into the prison , a place where the king 's prisoner be bind : and he be there in the prison .
but the lord be with joseph , and shew he mercy , and give he favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
and the keeper of the prison commit to joseph 's hand all the prisoner that be in the prison ; and whatsoever they do there , he be the doer of it .
the keeper of the prison look not to any thing that be under he hand ; because the lord be with he , and that which he do , the lord make it to prosper .
and it come to pass after these thing , that the butler of the king of egypt and he baker have offend they lord the king of egypt .
and pharaoh be wroth against two of he officer , against the chief of the butler , and against the chief of the baker .
and he put they in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where joseph be bind .
and the captain of the guard charge joseph with they , and he serve they : and they continue a season in ward .
and they dream a dream both of they , each man he dream in one night , each man accord to the interpretation of he dream , the butler and the baker of the king of egypt , which be bind in the prison .
and joseph come in unto they in the morning , and look upon they , and , behold , they be sad .
and he ask pharaoh 's officer that be with he in the ward of he lord 's house , say , wherefore look ye so sadly to day ?
and they say unto he , we have dream a dream , and there be no interpreter of it .
and joseph say unto they , do not interpretation belong to god ? tell i they , i pray you .
and the chief butler tell he dream to joseph , and say to he , in my dream , behold , a vine be before i ;
and in the vine be three branch : and it be as though it bud , and she blossom shoot forth ; and the cluster thereof bring forth ripe grape :
and pharaoh 's cup be in my hand : and i take the grape , and press they into pharaoh 's cup , and i give the cup into pharaoh 's hand .
and joseph say unto he , this be the interpretation of it : the three branch be three day :
yet within three day shall pharaoh lift up thine head , and restore thee unto thy place : and thou shalt deliver pharaoh 's cup into he hand , after the former manner when thou wast he butler .
but think on i when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , i pray thee , unto i , and make mention of i unto pharaoh , and bring i out of this house :
for indeed i be steal away out of the land of the hebrews : and here also have i do nothing that they should put i into the dungeon .
when the chief baker see that the interpretation be good , he say unto joseph , i also be in my dream , and , behold , i have three white basket on my head :
and in the uppermost basket there be of all manner of bakemeat for pharaoh ; and the bird do eat they out of the basket upon my head .
and joseph answer and say , this be the interpretation thereof : the three basket be three day :
yet within three day shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the bird shall eat thy flesh from off thee .
and it come to pass the third day , which be pharaoh 's birthday , that he make a feast unto all he servant : and he lift up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among he servant .
and he restore the chief butler unto he butlership again ; and he give the cup into pharaoh 's hand :
but he hang the chief baker : as joseph have interpret to they .
yet do not the chief butler remember joseph , but forgat he .
and it come to pass at the end of two full year , that pharaoh dream : and , behold , he stand by the river .
and , behold , there come up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatflesh ; and they feed in a meadow .
and , behold , seven other kine come up after they out of the river , ill favoured and leanflesh ; and stand by the other kine upon the brink of the river .
and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine do eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine .
so pharaoh awake .
and he sleep and dream the second time : and , behold , seven ear of corn come up upon one stalk , rank and good .
and , behold , seven thin ear and blast with the east wind spring up after they .
and the seven thin ear devour the seven rank and full ear .
and pharaoh awake , and , behold , it be a dream .
and it come to pass in the morning that he spirit be trouble ; and he send and call for all the magician of egypt , and all the wise man thereof : and pharaoh tell they he dream ; but there be none that could interpret they unto pharaoh .
then speak the chief butler unto pharaoh , say , i do remember my fault this day :
pharaoh be wroth with he servant , and put i in ward in the captain of the guard 's house , both i and the chief baker :
and we dream a dream in one night , i and he ; we dream each man accord to the interpretation of he dream .
and there be there with we a young man , a hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard ; and we tell he , and he interpret to we we dream ; to each man accord to he dream he do interpret .
and it come to pass , as he interpret to we , so it be ; i he restore unto mine office , and he he hang .
then pharaoh send and call joseph , and they bring he hastily out of the dungeon : and he shave himself , and change he raiment , and come in unto pharaoh .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , i have dream a dream , and there be none that can interpret it : and i have hear say of thee , that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it .
and joseph answer pharaoh , say , it be not in i : god shall give pharaoh a answer of peace .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , in my dream , behold , i stand upon the bank of the river :
and , behold , there come up out of the river seven kine , fatfleshed and well favour ; and they feed in a meadow :
and , behold , seven other kine come up after they , poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed , such as i never see in all the land of egypt for badness :
and the lean and the ill favoured kine do eat up the first seven fat kine :
and when they have eat they up , it could not be know that they have eat they ; but they be still ill favoured , as at the beginning .
so i awake .
and i see in my dream , and , behold , seven ear come up in one stalk , full and good :
and , behold , seven ear , wither , thin , and blast with the east wind , spring up after they :
and the thin ear devour the seven good ear : and i tell this unto the magician ; but there be none that could declare it to i .
and joseph say unto pharaoh , the dream of pharaoh be one : god have shewed pharaoh what he be about to do .
the seven good kine be seven year ; and the seven good ear be seven year : the dream be one .
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that come up after they be seven year ; and the seven empty ear blast with the east wind shall be seven year of famine .
this be the thing which i have speak unto pharaoh : what god be about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh .
behold , there come seven year of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt :
and there shall arise after they seven year of famine ; and all the plenty shall be forget in the land of egypt ; and the famine shall consume the land ;
and the plenty shall not be know in the land by reason of that famine follow ; for it shall be very grievous .
and for that the dream be double unto pharaoh twice ; it be because the thing be establish by god , and god will shortly bring it to pass .
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise , and set he over the land of egypt .
let pharaoh do this , and let he appoint officer over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous year .
and let they gather all the food of those good year that come , and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh , and let they keep food in the city .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven year of famine , which shall be in the land of egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
and the thing be good in the eye of pharaoh , and in the eye of all he servant .
and pharaoh say unto he servant , can we find such a one as this be , a man in whom the spirit of god be ?
and pharaoh say unto joseph , forasmuch as god have shewed thee all this , there be none so discreet and wise as thou art :
thou shalt be over my house , and accord unto thy word shall all my people be rule : only in the throne will i be greater than thou .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , see , i have set thee over all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh take off he ring from he hand , and put it upon joseph 's hand , and array he in vesture of fine linen , and put a gold chain about he neck ;
and he make he to ride in the second chariot which he have ; and they cry before he , bow the knee : and he make he ruler over all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , i be pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift up he hand or foot in all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh call joseph 's name zaphnathpaaneah ; and he give he to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on .
and joseph go out over all the land of egypt .
and joseph be thirty year old when he stand before pharaoh king of egypt .
and joseph go out from the presence of pharaoh , and go throughout all the land of egypt .
and in the seven plenteous year the earth bring forth by handful .
and he gather up all the food of the seven year , which be in the land of egypt , and lay up the food in the city : the food of the field , which be round about every city , lay he up in the same .
and joseph gather corn as the sand of the sea , very much , until he leave numbering ; for it be without number .
and unto joseph be bear two son before the year of famine come , which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto he .
and joseph call the name of the firstborn manasseh : for god , say he , have make i forget all my toil , and all my father 's house .
and the name of the second call he ephraim : for god have cause i to be fruitful in the land of my affliction .
and the seven year of plenteousness , that be in the land of egypt , be end .
and the seven year of dearth begin to come , accord as joseph have say : and the dearth be in all land ; but in all the land of egypt there be bread .
and when all the land of egypt be famish , the people cry to pharaoh for bread : and pharaoh say unto all the egyptians , go unto joseph ; what he saith to you , do .
and the famine be over all the face of the earth : and joseph open all the storehouse , and sell unto the egyptians ; and the famine wax sore in the land of egypt .
and all country come into egypt to joseph for to buy corn ; because that the famine be so sore in all land .
now when jacob see that there be corn in egypt , jacob say unto he son , why do ye look one upon another ?
and he say , behold , i have hear that there be corn in egypt : get you down thither , and buy for we from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
and joseph 's ten brethren go down to buy corn in egypt .
but benjamin , joseph 's brother , jacob send not with he brethren ; for he say , lest peradventure mischief befall he .
and the son of israel come to buy corn among those that come : for the famine be in the land of canaan .
and joseph be the governor over the land , and he it be that sell to all the people of the land : and joseph 's brethren come , and bow down themselves before he with they face to the earth .
and joseph see he brethren , and he know they , but make himself strange unto they , and spake roughly unto they ; and he say unto they , whence come ye ?
and they say , from the land of canaan to buy food .
and joseph know he brethren , but they know not he .
and joseph remember the dream which he dream of they , and say unto they , ye be spy ; to see the nakedness of the land ye be come .
and they say unto he , nay , my lord , but to buy food be thy servant come .
we be all one man 's son ; we be true man , thy servant be no spy .
and he say unto they , nay , but to see the nakedness of the land ye be come .
and they say , thy servant be twelve brethren , the son of one man in the land of canaan ; and , behold , the youngest be this day with we father , and one be not .
and joseph say unto they , that be it that i speak unto you , say , ye be spy :
hereby ye shall be prove : by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence , except you youngest brother come hither .
send one of you , and let he fetch you brother , and ye shall be keep in prison , that you word may be prove , whether there be any truth in you : or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye be spy .
and he put they all together into ward three day .
and joseph say unto they the third day , this do , and live ; for i fear god :
if ye be true man , let one of you brethren be bind in the house of you prison : go ye , carry corn for the famine of you house :
but bring you youngest brother unto i ; so shall you word be verify , and ye shall not die .
and they do so .
and they say one to another , we be verily guilty concern we brother , in that we see the anguish of he soul , when he beseech we , and we would not hear ; therefore be this distress come upon we .
and reuben answer they , say , spake i not unto you , say , do not sin against the child ; and ye would not hear ? therefore , behold , also he blood be require .
and they know not that joseph understand they ; for he speak unto they by a interpreter .
and he turn himself about from they , and weep ; and return to they again , and commune with they , and take from they simeon , and bind he before they eye .
then joseph command to fill they sack with corn , and to restore every man 's money into he sack , and to give they provision for the way : and thus do he unto they .
and they lade they ass with the corn , and depart thence .
and as one of they open he sack to give he ass provender in the inn , he espy he money ; for , behold , it be in he sack 's mouth .
and he say unto he brethren , my money be restore ; and , lo , it be even in my sack : and they heart fail they , and they be afraid , say one to another , what be this that god have do unto we ?
and they come unto jacob they father unto the land of canaan , and tell he all that befall unto they ; say ,
the man , who be the lord of the land , spake roughly to we , and take we for spy of the country .
and we say unto he , we be true man ; we be no spy :
we be twelve brethren , son of we father ; one be not , and the youngest be this day with we father in the land of canaan .
and the man , the lord of the country , say unto we , hereby shall i know that ye be true man ; leave one of you brethren here with i , and take food for the famine of you household , and be go :
and bring you youngest brother unto i : then shall i know that ye be no spy , but that ye be true man : so will i deliver you you brother , and ye shall traffick in the land .
and it come to pass as they empty they sack , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money be in he sack : and when both they and they father see the bundle of money , they be afraid .
and jacob they father say unto they , i have ye bereaved of my child : joseph be not , and simeon be not , and ye will take benjamin away : all these thing be against i .
and reuben spake unto he father , say , slay my two son , if i bring he not to thee : deliver he into my hand , and i will bring he to thee again .
and he say , my son shall not go down with you ; for he brother be dead , and he be leave alone : if mischief befall he by the way in the which ye go , then shall ye bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave .
and the famine be sore in the land .
and it come to pass , when they have eat up the corn which they have bring out of egypt , they father say unto they , go again , buy we a little food .
and judah spake unto he , say , the man do solemnly protest unto we , say , ye shall not see my face , except you brother be with you .
if thou wilt send we brother with we , we will go down and buy thee food :
but if thou wilt not send he , we will not go down : for the man say unto we , ye shall not see my face , except you brother be with you .
and israel say , wherefore deal ye so ill with i , as to tell the man whether ye have yet a brother ?
and they say , the man ask we straitly of we state , and of we kindred , say , be you father yet alive ? have ye another brother ? and we tell he accord to the tenor of these word : could we certainly know that he would say , bring you brother down ?
and judah say unto israel he father , send the lad with i , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and thou , and also we little one .
i will be surety for he ; of my hand shalt thou require he : if i bring he not unto thee , and set he before thee , then let i bear the blame for ever :
for except we have linger , surely now we have return this second time .
and they father israel say unto they , if it must be so now , do this ; take of the best fruit in the land in you vessel , and carry down the man a present , a little balm , and a little honey , spice , and myrrh , nut , and almond :
and take double money in you hand ; and the money that be bring again in the mouth of you sack , carry it again in you hand ; peradventure it be a oversight :
take also you brother , and arise , go again unto the man :
and god almighty give you mercy before the man , that he may send away you other brother , and benjamin .
if i be bereave of my child , i be bereaved .
and the man take that present , and they take double money in they hand , and benjamin ; and rise up , and go down to egypt , and stand before joseph .
and when joseph see benjamin with they , he say to the ruler of he house , bring these man home , and slay , and make ready ; for these man shall dine with i at noon .
and the man do as joseph bid ; and the man bring the man into joseph 's house .
and the man be afraid , because they be bring into joseph 's house ; and they say , because of the money that be return in we sack at the first time be we bring in ; that he may seek occasion against we , and fall upon we , and take we for bondman , and we ass .
and they come near to the steward of joseph 's house , and they commune with he at the door of the house ,
and say , o sir , we come indeed down at the first time to buy food :
and it come to pass , when we come to the inn , that we open we sack , and , behold , every man 's money be in the mouth of he sack , we money in full weight : and we have bring it again in we hand .
and other money have we bring down in we hand to buy food : we can not tell who put we money in we sack .
and he say , peace be to you , fear not : you god , and the god of you father , have give you treasure in you sack : i have you money .
and he bring simeon out unto they .
and the man bring the man into joseph 's house , and give they water , and they wash they foot ; and he give they ass provender .
and they make ready the present against joseph come at noon : for they hear that they should eat bread there .
and when joseph come home , they bring he the present which be in they hand into the house , and bow themselves to he to the earth .
and he ask they of they welfare , and say , be you father well , the old man of whom ye spake ?
be he yet alive ?
and they answer , thy servant we father be in good health , he be yet alive .
and they bow down they head , and make obeisance .
and he lift up he eye , and see he brother benjamin , he mother 's son , and say , be this you younger brother , of whom ye spake unto i ?
and he say , god be gracious unto thee , my son .
and joseph make haste ; for he bowels do yearn upon he brother : and he seek where to weep ; and he enter into he chamber , and weep there .
and he wash he face , and go out , and refrain himself , and say , set on bread .
and they set on for he by himself , and for they by themselves , and for the egyptians , which do eat with he , by themselves : because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews ; for that be a abomination unto the egyptians .
and they sit before he , the firstborn accord to he birthright , and the youngest accord to he youth : and the man marvel one at another .
and he take and send mess unto they from before he : but benjamin 's mess be five time so much as any of theirs .
and they drink , and be merry with he .
and he command the steward of he house , say , fill the man 's sack with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man 's money in he sack 's mouth .
and put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack 's mouth of the youngest , and he corn money .
and he do accord to the word that joseph have speak .
as soon as the morning be light , the man be send away , they and they ass .
and when they be go out of the city , and not yet far off , joseph say unto he steward , up , follow after the man ; and when thou dost overtake they , say unto they , wherefore have ye reward evil for good ?
be not this it in which my lord drinketh , and whereby indeed he divineth ? ye have do evil in so do .
and he overtake they , and he speak unto they these same word .
and they say unto he , wherefore saith my lord these word ?
god forbid that thy servant should do accord to this thing :
behold , the money , which we find in we sack ' mouth , we bring again unto thee out of the land of canaan : how then should we steal out of thy lord 's house silver or gold ?
with whomsoever of thy servant it be find , both let he die , and we also will be my lord 's bondman .
and he say , now also let it be accord unto you word : he with whom it be find shall be my servant ; and ye shall be blameless .
then they speedily take down every man he sack to the ground , and open every man he sack .
and he search , and begin at the eldest , and leave at the youngest : and the cup be find in benjamin 's sack .
then they rent they clothes , and laded every man he ass , and return to the city .
and judah and he brethren come to joseph 's house ; for he be yet there : and they fall before he on the ground .
and joseph say unto they , what deed be this that ye have do ? wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine ?
and judah say , what shall we say unto my lord ? what shall we speak ? or how shall we clear ourselves ?
god have find out the iniquity of thy servant : behold , we be my lord 's servant , both we , and he also with whom the cup be find .
and he say , god forbid that i should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup be find , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto you father .
then judah come near unto he , and say , oh my lord , let thy servant , i pray thee , speak a word in my lord 's ear , and let not thine anger burn against thy servant : for thou art even as pharaoh .
my lord ask he servant , say , have ye a father , or a brother ?
and we say unto my lord , we have a father , a old man , and a child of he old age , a little one ; and he brother be dead , and he alone be leave of he mother , and he father loveth he .
and thou saidst unto thy servant , bring he down unto i , that i may set mine eye upon he .
and we say unto my lord , the lad can not leave he father : for if he should leave he father , he father would die .
and thou saidst unto thy servant , except you youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more .
and it come to pass when we come up unto thy servant my father , we tell he the word of my lord .
and we father say , go again , and buy we a little food .
and we say , we can not go down : if we youngest brother be with we , then will we go down : for we may not see the man 's face , except we youngest brother be with we .
and thy servant my father say unto we , ye know that my wife bare i two son :
and the one go out from i , and i say , surely he be tear in piece ; and i see he not since :
and if ye take this also from i , and mischief befall he , ye shall bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave .
now therefore when i come to thy servant my father , and the lad be not with we ; see that he life be bind up in the lad 's life ;
it shall come to pass , when he seeth that the lad be not with we , that he will die : and thy servant shall bring down the gray hair of thy servant we father with sorrow to the grave .
for thy servant become surety for the lad unto my father , say , if i bring he not unto thee , then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever .
now therefore , i pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with he brethren .
for how shall i go up to my father , and the lad be not with i ? lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father .
then joseph could not refrain himself before all they that stand by he ; and he cry , cause every man to go out from i .
and there stand no man with he , while joseph make himself known unto he brethren .
and he weep aloud : and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh hear .
and joseph say unto he brethren , i be joseph ; doth my father yet live ?
and he brethren could not answer he ; for they be trouble at he presence .
and joseph say unto he brethren , come near to i , i pray you .
and they come near .
and he say , i be joseph you brother , whom ye sell into egypt .
now therefore be not grieve , nor angry with yourselve , that ye sell i hither : for god do send i before you to preserve life .
for these two year have the famine be in the land : and yet there be five year , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
and god send i before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth , and to save you life by a great deliverance .
so now it be not you that send i hither , but god : and he have make i a father to pharaoh , and lord of all he house , and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt .
haste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto he , thus saith thy son joseph , god have make i lord of all egypt : come down unto i , tarry not :
and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen , and thou shalt be near unto i , thou , and thy child , and thy child 's child , and thy flock , and thy herd , and all that thou hast :
and there will i nourish thee ; for yet there be five year of famine ; lest thou , and thy household , and all that thou hast , come to poverty .
and , behold , you eye see , and the eye of my brother benjamin , that it be my mouth that speaketh unto you .
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt , and of all that ye have see ; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither .
and he fall upon he brother benjamin 's neck , and weep ; and benjamin weep upon he neck .
moreover he kiss all he brethren , and weep upon they : and after that he brethren talk with he .
and the fame thereof be hear in pharaoh 's house , say , joseph 's brethren be come : and it pleased pharaoh well , and he servant .
and pharaoh say unto joseph , say unto thy brethren , this do ye ; lade you beast , and go , get you unto the land of canaan ;
and take you father and you household , and come unto i : and i will give you the good of the land of egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
now thou art command , this do ye ; take you wagon out of the land of egypt for you little one , and for you wife , and bring you father , and come .
also regard not you stuff ; for the good of all the land of egypt be yours .
and the child of israel do so : and joseph give they wagon , accord to the commandment of pharaoh , and give they provision for the way .
to all of they he give each man change of raiment ; but to benjamin he give three hundred piece of silver , and five change of raiment .
and to he father he send after this manner ; ten ass laden with the good thing of egypt , and ten she ass laden with corn and bread and meat for he father by the way .
so he send he brethren away , and they depart : and he say unto they , see that ye fall not out by the way .
and they go up out of egypt , and come into the land of canaan unto jacob they father ,
and tell he , say , joseph be yet alive , and he be governor over all the land of egypt .
and jacob 's heart faint , for he believe they not .
and they tell he all the word of joseph , which he have say unto they : and when he see the wagon which joseph have send to carry he , the spirit of jacob they father revive :
and israel say , it be enough ; joseph my son be yet alive : i will go and see he before i die .
and israel take he journey with all that he have , and come to beersheba , and offer sacrifice unto the god of he father isaac .
and god speak unto israel in the vision of the night , and say , jacob , jacob .
and he say , here be i.
and he say , i be god , the god of thy father : fear not to go down into egypt ; for i will there make of thee a great nation :
i will go down with thee into egypt ; and i will also surely bring thee up again : and joseph shall put he hand upon thine eye .
and jacob rise up from beersheba : and the son of israel carry jacob they father , and they little one , and they wife , in the wagon which pharaoh have send to carry he .
and they take they cattle , and they goods , which they have get in the land of canaan , and come into egypt , jacob , and all he seed with he :
he son , and he son ' son with he , he daughter , and he son ' daughter , and all he seed bring he with he into egypt .
and these be the name of the child of israel , which come into egypt , jacob and he son : reuben , jacob 's firstborn .

and the son of issachar ; tola , and phuvah , and job , and shimron .
and the son of zebulun ; sered , and elon , and jahleel .
these be the son of leah , which she bare unto jacob in padanaram , with he daughter dinah : all the soul of he son and he daughter be thirty and three .
and the son of gad ; ziphion , and haggi , shuni , and ezbon , eri , and arodi , and areli .
and the son of asher ; jimnah , and ishuah , and isui , and beriah , and serah they sister : and the son of beriah ; heber , and malchiel .
these be the son of zilpah , whom laban give to leah he daughter , and these she bare unto jacob , even sixteen soul .

and the son of joseph , which be bear he in egypt , be two soul : all the soul of the house of jacob , which come into egypt , be threescore and ten .
and he send judah before he unto joseph , to direct he face unto goshen ; and they come into the land of goshen .
and joseph make ready he chariot , and go up to meet israel he father , to goshen , and present himself unto he ; and he fall on he neck , and weep on he neck a good while .
and israel say unto joseph , now let i die , since i have see thy face , because thou art yet alive .
and joseph say unto he brethren , and unto he father 's house , i will go up , and shew pharaoh , and say unto he , my brethren , and my father 's house , which be in the land of canaan , be come unto i ;
and the man be shepherd , for they trade have be to feed cattle ; and they have bring they flock , and they herd , and all that they have .
and it shall come to pass , when pharaoh shall call you , and shall say , what be you occupation ?
that ye shall say , thy servant ' trade have be about cattle from we youth even until now , both we , and also we father : that ye may dwell in the land of goshen ; for every shepherd be a abomination unto the egyptians .
then joseph come and tell pharaoh , and say , my father and my brethren , and they flock , and they herd , and all that they have , be come out of the land of canaan ; and , behold , they be in the land of goshen .
and he take some of he brethren , even five man , and present they unto pharaoh .
and pharaoh say unto he brethren , what be you occupation ?
and they say unto pharaoh , thy servant be shepherd , both we , and also we father .
they say moreover unto pharaoh , for to sojourn in the land be we come ; for thy servant have no pasture for they flock ; for the famine be sore in the land of canaan : now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servant dwell in the land of goshen .
and pharaoh speak unto joseph , say , thy father and thy brethren be come unto thee :
the land of egypt be before thee ; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell ; in the land of goshen let they dwell : and if thou knowest any man of activity among they , then make they ruler over my cattle .
and joseph bring in jacob he father , and set he before pharaoh : and jacob bless pharaoh .
and pharaoh say unto jacob , how old art thou ?
and jacob say unto pharaoh , the day of the year of my pilgrimage be a hundred and thirty year : few and evil have the day of the year of my life be , and have not attain unto the day of the year of the life of my father in the day of they pilgrimage .
and jacob bless pharaoh , and go out from before pharaoh .
and joseph place he father and he brethren , and give they a possession in the land of egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of rameses , as pharaoh have command .
and joseph nourish he father , and he brethren , and all he father 's household , with bread , accord to they family .
and there be no bread in all the land ; for the famine be very sore , so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan faint by reason of the famine .
and joseph gather up all the money that be find in the land of egypt , and in the land of canaan , for the corn which they buy : and joseph bring the money into pharaoh 's house .
and when money fail in the land of egypt , and in the land of canaan , all the egyptians come unto joseph , and say , give we bread : for why should we die in thy presence ? for the money faileth .
and joseph say , give you cattle ; and i will give you for you cattle , if money fail .
and they bring they cattle unto joseph : and joseph give they bread in exchange for horse , and for the flock , and for the cattle of the herd , and for the ass : and he feed they with bread for all they cattle for that year .
when that year be end , they come unto he the second year , and say unto he , we will not hide it from my lord , how that we money be spend ; my lord also have we herd of cattle ; there be not ought left in the sight of my lord , but we body , and we land :
wherefore shall we die before thine eye , both we and we land ? buy we and we land for bread , and we and we land will be servant unto pharaoh : and give we seed , that we may live , and not die , that the land be not desolate .
and joseph buy all the land of egypt for pharaoh ; for the egyptians sell every man he field , because the famine prevail over they : so the land become pharaoh 's .
and as for the people , he remove they to city from one end of the border of egypt even to the other end thereof .
only the land of the priest buy he not ; for the priest have a portion assign they of pharaoh , and do eat they portion which pharaoh give they : wherefore they sell not they land .
then joseph say unto the people , behold , i have buy you this day and you land for pharaoh : lo , here be seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
and it shall come to pass in the increase , that ye shall give the fifth part unto pharaoh , and four part shall be you own , for seed of the field , and for you food , and for they of you household , and for food for you little one .
and they say , thou hast save we life : let we find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be pharaoh 's servant .
and joseph make it a law over the land of egypt unto this day , that pharaoh should have the fifth part ; except the land of the priest only , which become not pharaoh 's .
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt , in the country of goshen ; and they have possession therein , and grow , and multiply exceedingly .
and jacob live in the land of egypt seventeen year : so the whole age of jacob be a hundred forty and seven year .
and the time draw nigh that israel must die : and he call he son joseph , and say unto he , if now i have find grace in thy sight , put , i pray thee , thy hand under my thigh , and deal kindly and truly with i ; bury i not , i pray thee , in egypt :
but i will lie with my father , and thou shalt carry i out of egypt , and bury i in they buryingplace .
and he say , i will do as thou hast say .
and he say , swear unto i .
and he sware unto he .
and israel bow himself upon the bed 's head .
and it come to pass after these thing , that one tell joseph , behold , thy father be sick : and he take with he he two son , manasseh and ephraim .
and one tell jacob , and say , behold , thy son joseph cometh unto thee : and israel strengthen himself , and sit upon the bed .
and jacob say unto joseph , god almighty appear unto i at luz in the land of canaan , and bless i ,
and say unto i , behold , i will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and i will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for a everlasting possession .
and now thy two son , ephraim and manasseh , which be bear unto thee in the land of egypt before i come unto thee into egypt , be mine ; as reuben and simeon , they shall be mine .
and thy issue , which thou begettest after they , shall be thine , and shall be call after the name of they brethren in they inheritance .
and as for i , when i come from padan , rachel die by i in the land of canaan in the way , when yet there be but a little way to come unto ephrath : and i bury she there in the way of ephrath ; the same be bethlehem .
and israel behold joseph 's son , and say , who be these ?
and joseph say unto he father , they be my son , whom god have give i in this place .
and he say , bring they , i pray thee , unto i , and i will bless they .
now the eye of israel be dim for age , so that he could not see .
and he bring they near unto he ; and he kiss they , and embrace they .
and israel say unto joseph , i have not think to see thy face : and , lo , god have shew i also thy seed .
and joseph bring they out from between he knee , and he bow himself with he face to the earth .
and joseph take they both , ephraim in he right hand toward israel 's left hand , and manasseh in he left hand toward israel 's right hand , and bring they near unto he .
and israel stretch out he right hand , and lay it upon ephraim 's head , who be the younger , and he left hand upon manasseh 's head , guide he hand wittingly ; for manasseh be the firstborn .
and he bless joseph , and say , god , before whom my father abraham and isaac do walk , the god which feed i all my life long unto this day ,
the angel which redeem i from all evil , bless the lad ; and let my name be name on they , and the name of my father abraham and isaac ; and let they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
and when joseph see that he father lay he right hand upon the head of ephraim , it displeased he : and he hold up he father 's hand , to remove it from ephraim 's head unto manasseh 's head .
and joseph say unto he father , not so , my father : for this be the firstborn ; put thy right hand upon he head .
and he father refuse , and say , i know it , my son , i know it : he also shall become a people , and he also shall be great : but truly he younger brother shall be greater than he , and he seed shall become a multitude of nation .
and he bless they that day , say , in thee shall israel bless , say , god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh : and he set ephraim before manasseh .
and israel say unto joseph , behold , i die : but god shall be with you , and bring you again unto the land of you father .
moreover i have give to thee one portion above thy brethren , which i take out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow .
and jacob call unto he son , and say , gather yourselve together , that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last day .
gather yourselve together , and hear , ye son of jacob ; and hearken unto israel you father .
reuben , thou art my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity , and the excellency of power :
unstable as water , thou shalt not excel ; because thou wentest up to thy father 's bed ; then defiledst thou it : he go up to my couch .
simeon and levi be brethren ; instrument of cruelty be in they habitation .
o my soul , come not thou into they secret ; unto they assembly , mine honour , be not thou unite : for in they anger they slew a man , and in they selfwill they dig down a wall .
curse be they anger , for it be fierce ; and they wrath , for it be cruel : i will divide they in jacob , and scatter they in israel .
judah , thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise : thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemy ; thy father 's child shall bow down before thee .
judah be a lion 's whelp : from the prey , my son , thou art go up : he stoop down , he couch as a lion , and as a old lion ; who shall rouse he up ?
the sceptre shall not depart from judah , nor a lawgiver from between he foot , until shiloh come ; and unto he shall the gathering of the people be .
bind he foal unto the vine , and he ass 's colt unto the choice vine ; he wash he garment in wine , and he clothes in the blood of grape :
he eye shall be red with wine , and he tooth white with milk .
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ; and he shall be for a haven of ship ; and he border shall be unto zidon .
issachar be a strong ass couch down between two burden :
and he see that rest be good , and the land that it be pleasant ; and bow he shoulder to bear , and become a servant unto tribute .
dan shall judge he people , as one of the tribe of israel .
dan shall be a serpent by the way , a adder in the path , that biteth the horse heel , so that he rider shall fall backward .
i have wait for thy salvation , o lord .
gad , a troop shall overcome he : but he shall overcome at the last .
out of asher he bread shall be fat , and he shall yield royal dainty .
naphtali be a hind let loose : he giveth goodly word .
joseph be a fruitful bough , even a fruitful bough by a well ; whose branch run over the wall :
the archer have sorely grieve he , and shot at he , and hate he :
but he bow abode in strength , and the arm of he hand be make strong by the hand of the mighty god of jacob ; ( from thence be the shepherd , the stone of israel : )
even by the god of thy father , who shall help thee ; and by the almighty , who shall bless thee with blessing of heaven above , blessing of the deep that lieth under , blessing of the breast , and of the womb :
the blessing of thy father have prevail above the blessing of my progenitor unto the utmost bind of the everlasting hill : they shall be on the head of joseph , and on the crown of the head of he that be separate from he brethren .
benjamin shall ravin as a wolf : in the morning he shall devour the prey , and at night he shall divide the spoil .
all these be the twelve tribe of israel : and this be it that they father spake unto they , and bless they ; every one accord to he blessing he bless they .
and he charge they , and say unto they , i be to be gather unto my people : bury i with my father in the cave that be in the field of ephron the hittite ,
in the cave that be in the field of machpelah , which be before mamre , in the land of canaan , which abraham buy with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace .
there they bury abraham and sarah he wife ; there they bury isaac and rebekah he wife ; and there i bury leah .
the purchase of the field and of the cave that be therein be from the child of heth .
and when jacob have make a end of command he son , he gather up he foot into the bed , and yield up the ghost , and be gather unto he people .
and joseph fall upon he father 's face , and weep upon he , and kiss he .
and joseph command he servant the physician to embalm he father : and the physician embalm israel .
and forty day be fulfil for he ; for so be fulfil the day of those which be embalm : and the egyptians mourn for he threescore and ten day .
and when the day of he mourning be past , joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh , say , if now i have find grace in you eye , speak , i pray you , in the ear of pharaoh , say ,
my father make i swear , say , lo , i die : in my grave which i have dig for i in the land of canaan , there shalt thou bury i .
now therefore let i go up , i pray thee , and bury my father , and i will come again .
and pharaoh say , go up , and bury thy father , accord as he make thee swear .
and joseph go up to bury he father : and with he go up all the servant of pharaoh , the elder of he house , and all the elder of the land of egypt ,
and all the house of joseph , and he brethren , and he father 's house : only they little one , and they flock , and they herd , they leave in the land of goshen .
and there go up with he both chariot and horseman : and it be a very great company .
and they come to the threshingfloor of atad , which be beyond jordan , and there they mourn with a great and very sore lamentation : and he make a mourning for he father seven day .
and when the inhabitant of the land , the canaanites , see the mourning in the floor of atad , they say , this be a grievous mourning to the egyptians : wherefore the name of it be call abelmizraim , which be beyond jordan .
and he son do unto he accord as he command they :
for he son carry he into the land of canaan , and bury he in the cave of the field of machpelah , which abraham buy with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite , before mamre .
and joseph return into egypt , he , and he brethren , and all that go up with he to bury he father , after he have bury he father .
and when joseph 's brethren see that they father be dead , they say , joseph will peradventure hate we , and will certainly requite we all the evil which we do unto he .
and they send a messenger unto joseph , say , thy father do command before he die , say ,
so shall ye say unto joseph , forgive , i pray thee now , the trespass of thy brethren , and they sin ; for they do unto thee evil : and now , we pray thee , forgive the trespass of the servant of the god of thy father .
and joseph weep when they speak unto he .
and he brethren also go and fall down before he face ; and they say , behold , we be thy servant .
and joseph say unto they , fear not : for be i in the place of god ?
but as for you , ye think evil against i ; but god mean it unto good , to bring to pass , as it be this day , to save much people alive .
now therefore fear ye not : i will nourish you , and you little one .
and he comfort they , and spake kindly unto they .
and joseph dwelt in egypt , he , and he father 's house : and joseph live a hundred and ten year .
and joseph see ephraim 's child of the third generation : the child also of machir the son of manasseh be bring up upon joseph 's knee .
and joseph say unto he brethren , i die : and god will surely visit you , and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob .
and joseph take a oath of the child of israel , say , god will surely visit you , and ye shall carry up my bone from hence .
so joseph die , be a hundred and ten year old : and they embalm he , and he be put in a coffin in egypt .
now these be the name of the child of israel , which come into egypt ; every man and he household come with jacob .
reuben , simeon , levi , and judah ,
issachar , zebulun , and benjamin ,
dan , and naphtali , gad , and asher .
and all the soul that come out of the loin of jacob be seventy soul : for joseph be in egypt already .
and joseph die , and all he brethren , and all that generation .
and the child of israel be fruitful , and increase abundantly , and multiply , and wax exceed mighty ; and the land be fill with they .
now there arise up a new king over egypt , which know not joseph .
and he say unto he people , behold , the people of the child of israel be more and mightier than we :
come on , let we deal wisely with they ; lest they multiply , and it come to pass , that , when there falleth out any war , they join also unto we enemy , and fight against we , and so get they up out of the land .
therefore they do set over they taskmaster to afflict they with they burden .
and they build for pharaoh treasure city , pithom and raamses .
but the more they afflict they , the more they multiply and grow .
and they be grieve because of the child of israel .
and the egyptians make the child of israel to serve with rigour :
and they make they life bitter with hard bondage , in morter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all they service , wherein they make they serve , be with rigour .
and the king of egypt speak to the hebrew midwife , of which the name of the one be shiphrah , and the name of the other puah :
and he say , when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew woman , and see they upon the stool ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill he : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
but the midwife fear god , and do not as the king of egypt command they , but save the man child alive .
and the king of egypt call for the midwife , and say unto they , why have ye do this thing , and have save the man child alive ?
and the midwife say unto pharaoh , because the hebrew woman be not as the egyptian woman ; for they be lively , and be deliver ere the midwife come in unto they .
therefore god deal well with the midwife : and the people multiply , and wax very mighty .
and it come to pass , because the midwife fear god , that he make they house .
and pharaoh charge all he people , say , every son that be bear ye shall cast into the river , and every daughter ye shall save alive .
and there go a man of the house of levi , and take to wife a daughter of levi .
and the woman conceive , and bare a son : and when she see he that he be a goodly child , she hide he three month .
and when she could not longer hide he , she take for he a ark of bulrush , and daub it with slime and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she lay it in the flag by the river 's brink .
and he sister stand afar off , to wit what would be do to he .
and the daughter of pharaoh come down to wash herself at the river ; and she maiden walk along by the river 's side ; and when she see the ark among the flag , she send she maid to fetch it .
and when she have open it , she see the child : and , behold , the babe weep .
and she have compassion on he , and say , this be one of the hebrews ' child .
then say he sister to pharaoh 's daughter , shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew woman , that she may nurse the child for thee ?
and pharaoh 's daughter say to she , go .
and the maid go and call the child 's mother .
and pharaoh 's daughter say unto she , take this child away , and nurse it for i , and i will give thee thy wages .
and the woman take the child , and nurse it .
and the child grow , and she bring he unto pharaoh 's daughter , and he become she son .
and she call he name mose : and she say , because i draw he out of the water .
and it come to pass in those day , when moses be grow , that he go out unto he brethren , and look on they burden : and he spy a egyptian smite a hebrew , one of he brethren .
and he look this way and that way , and when he see that there be no man , he slew the egyptian , and hide he in the sand .
and when he go out the second day , behold , two man of the hebrews strive together : and he say to he that do the wrong , wherefore smitest thou thy fellow ?
and he say , who make thee a prince and a judge over we ? intendest thou to kill i , as thou killedst the egyptian ?
and moses fear , and say , surely this thing be know .
now when pharaoh hear this thing , he seek to slay moses .
but moses flee from the face of pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of midian : and he sit down by a well .
now the priest of midian have seven daughter : and they come and draw water , and fill the trough to water they father 's flock .
and the shepherd come and drive they away : but moses stand up and help they , and water they flock .
and when they come to reuel they father , he say , how be it that ye be come so soon to day ?
and they say , a egyptian deliver we out of the hand of the shepherd , and also draw water enough for we , and water the flock .
and he say unto he daughter , and where be he ? why be it that ye have leave the man ? call he , that he may eat bread .
and moses be content to dwell with the man : and he give moses zipporah he daughter .
and she bare he a son , and he call he name gershom : for he say , i have be a stranger in a strange land .
and it come to pass in process of time , that the king of egypt die : and the child of israel sigh by reason of the bondage , and they cry , and they cry come up unto god by reason of the bondage .
and god hear they groaning , and god remember he covenant with abraham , with isaac , and with jacob .
and god look upon the child of israel , and god have respect unto they .
now mose keep the flock of jethro he father in law , the priest of midian : and he lead the flock to the backside of the desert , and come to the mountain of god , even to horeb .
and the angel of the lord appear unto he in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he look , and , behold , the bush burn with fire , and the bush be not consume .
and moses say , i will now turn aside , and see this great sight , why the bush be not burnt .
and when the lord see that he turn aside to see , god call unto he out of the midst of the bush , and say , moses , moses .
and he say , here be i.
and he say , draw not nigh hither : put off thy shoe from off thy foot , for the place whereon thou standest be holy ground .
moreover he say , i be the god of thy father , the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob .
and moses hide he face ; for he be afraid to look upon god .
and the lord say , i have surely see the affliction of my people which be in egypt , and have hear they cry by reason of they taskmaster ; for i know they sorrow ;
and i be come down to deliver they out of the hand of the egyptians , and to bring they up out of that land unto a good land and a large , unto a land flow with milk and honey ; unto the place of the canaanites , and the hittites , and the amorites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites .
now therefore , behold , the cry of the child of israel be come unto i : and i have also see the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress they .
come now therefore , and i will send thee unto pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the child of israel out of egypt .
and moses say unto god , who be i , that i should go unto pharaoh , and that i should bring forth the child of israel out of egypt ?
and he say , certainly i will be with thee ; and this shall be a token unto thee , that i have send thee : when thou hast bring forth the people out of egypt , ye shall serve god upon this mountain .
and moses say unto god , behold , when i come unto the child of israel , and shall say unto they , the god of you father have send i unto you ; and they shall say to i , what be he name ? what shall i say unto they ?
and god say unto mose , i be that i be : and he say , thus shalt thou say unto the child of israel , i be have send i unto you .
and god say moreover unto mose , thus shalt thou say unto the child of israel , the lord god of you father , the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob , have send i unto you : this be my name for ever , and this be my memorial unto all generation .
go , and gather the elder of israel together , and say unto they , the lord god of you father , the god of abraham , of isaac , and of jacob , appear unto i , say , i have surely visit you , and see that which be do to you in egypt :
and i have say , i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites , and the hittites , and the amorites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , unto a land flow with milk and honey .
and they shall hearken to thy voice : and thou shalt come , thou and the elder of israel , unto the king of egypt , and ye shall say unto he , the lord god of the hebrews have meet with we : and now let we go , we beseech thee , three day ' journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to the lord we god .
and i be sure that the king of egypt will not let you go , no , not by a mighty hand .
and i will stretch out my hand , and smite egypt with all my wonder which i will do in the midst thereof : and after that he will let you go .
and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
but every woman shall borrow of she neighbour , and of she that sojourneth in she house , jewel of silver , and jewel of gold , and raiment : and ye shall put they upon you son , and upon you daughter ; and ye shall spoil the egyptians .
and mose answer and say , but , behold , they will not believe i , nor hearken unto my voice : for they will say , the lord have not appear unto thee .
and the lord say unto he , what be that in thine hand ?
and he say , a rod .
and he say , cast it on the ground .
and he cast it on the ground , and it become a serpent ; and moses flee from before it .
and the lord say unto moses , put forth thine hand , and take it by the tail .
and he put forth he hand , and catch it , and it become a rod in he hand :
that they may believe that the lord god of they father , the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob , have appear unto thee .
and the lord say furthermore unto he , put now thine hand into thy bosom .
and he put he hand into he bosom : and when he take it out , behold , he hand be leprous as snow .
and he say , put thine hand into thy bosom again .
and he put he hand into he bosom again ; and pluck it out of he bosom , and , behold , it be turn again as he other flesh .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two sign , neither hearken unto thy voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour it upon the dry land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land .
and moses say unto the lord , o my lord , i be not eloquent , neither heretofore , nor since thou hast speak unto thy servant : but i be slow of speech , and of a slow tongue .
and the lord say unto he , who have make man 's mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the see , or the blind ? have not i the lord ?
now therefore go , and i will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt say .
and he say , o my lord , send , i pray thee , by the hand of he whom thou wilt send .
and the anger of the lord be kindle against moses , and he say , be not aaron the levite thy brother ?
i know that he can speak well .
and also , behold , he cometh forth to meet thee : and when he seeth thee , he will be glad in he heart .
and thou shalt speak unto he , and put word in he mouth : and i will be with thy mouth , and with he mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to he instead of god .
and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand , wherewith thou shalt do sign .
and moses go and return to jethro he father in law , and say unto he , let i go , i pray thee , and return unto my brethren which be in egypt , and see whether they be yet alive .
and jethro say to moses , go in peace .
and the lord say unto mose in midian , go , return into egypt : for all the man be dead which seek thy life .
and moses take he wife and he son , and set they upon a ass , and he return to the land of egypt : and moses take the rod of god in he hand .
and the lord say unto mose , when thou goest to return into egypt , see that thou do all those wonder before pharaoh , which i have put in thine hand : but i will harden he heart , that he shall not let the people go .
and thou shalt say unto pharaoh , thus saith the lord , israel be my son , even my firstborn :
and i say unto thee , let my son go , that he may serve i : and if thou refuse to let he go , behold , i will slay thy son , even thy firstborn .
and it come to pass by the way in the inn , that the lord meet he , and seek to kill he .
then zipporah take a sharp stone , and cut off the foreskin of she son , and cast it at he foot , and say , surely a bloody husband art thou to i .
so he let he go : then she say , a bloody husband thou art , because of the circumcision .
and the lord say to aaron , go into the wilderness to meet moses .
and he go , and meet he in the mount of god , and kiss he .
and moses tell aaron all the word of the lord who have send he , and all the sign which he have command he .
and moses and aaron go and gather together all the elder of the child of israel :
and aaron speak all the word which the lord have speak unto mose , and do the sign in the sight of the people .
and the people believe : and when they hear that the lord have visit the child of israel , and that he have look upon they affliction , then they bow they head and worship .
and afterward moses and aaron go in , and tell pharaoh , thus saith the lord god of israel , let my people go , that they may hold a feast unto i in the wilderness .
and pharaoh say , who be the lord , that i should obey he voice to let israel go ?
i know not the lord , neither will i let israel go .
and they say , the god of the hebrews have meet with we : let we go , we pray thee , three day ' journey into the desert , and sacrifice unto the lord we god ; lest he fall upon we with pestilence , or with the sword .
and the king of egypt say unto they , wherefore do ye , moses and aaron , let the people from they work ? get you unto you burden .
and pharaoh say , behold , the people of the land now be many , and ye make they rest from they burden .
and pharaoh command the same day the taskmaster of the people , and they officer , say ,
ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as heretofore : let they go and gather straw for themselves .
and the tale of the brick , which they do make heretofore , ye shall lay upon they ; ye shall not diminish ought thereof : for they be idle ; therefore they cry , say , let we go and sacrifice to we god .
let there more work be lay upon the man , that they may labour therein ; and let they not regard vain word .
and the taskmaster of the people go out , and they officer , and they speak to the people , say , thus saith pharaoh , i will not give you straw .
go ye , get you straw where ye can find it : yet not ought of you work shall be diminish .
so the people be scatter abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble instead of straw .
and the taskmaster hast they , say , fulfil you work , you daily task , as when there be straw .
and the officer of the child of israel , which pharaoh 's taskmaster have set over they , be beat , and demand , wherefore have ye not fulfil you task in make brick both yesterday and to day , as heretofore ?
then the officer of the child of israel come and cry unto pharaoh , say , wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servant ?
there be no straw give unto thy servant , and they say to we , make brick : and , behold , thy servant be beat ; but the fault be in thine own people .
but he say , ye be idle , ye be idle : therefore ye say , let we go and do sacrifice to the lord .
go therefore now , and work ; for there shall no straw be give you , yet shall ye deliver the tale of brick .
and the officer of the child of israel do see that they be in evil case , after it be say , ye shall not minish ought from you brick of you daily task .
and they meet moses and aaron , who stand in the way , as they come forth from pharaoh :
and they say unto they , the lord look upon you , and judge ; because ye have make we savour to be abhor in the eye of pharaoh , and in the eye of he servant , to put a sword in they hand to slay we .
and moses return unto the lord , and say , lord , wherefore hast thou so evil entreat this people ? why be it that thou hast send i ?
for since i come to pharaoh to speak in thy name , he have do evil to this people ; neither hast thou deliver thy people at all .
then the lord say unto mose , now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh : for with a strong hand shall he let they go , and with a strong hand shall he drive they out of he land .
and god speak unto mose , and say unto he , i be the lord :
and i appear unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob , by the name of god almighty , but by my name jehovah be i not know to they .
and i have also establish my covenant with they , to give they the land of canaan , the land of they pilgrimage , wherein they be stranger .
and i have also hear the groaning of the child of israel , whom the egyptians keep in bondage ; and i have remember my covenant .
wherefore say unto the child of israel , i be the lord , and i will bring you out from under the burden of the egyptians , and i will rid you out of they bondage , and i will redeem you with a stretch out arm , and with great judgment :
and i will take you to i for a people , and i will be to you a god : and ye shall know that i be the lord you god , which bringeth you out from under the burden of the egyptians .
and i will bring you in unto the land , concern the which i do swear to give it to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob ; and i will give it you for a heritage : i be the lord .
and moses spake so unto the child of israel : but they hearken not unto mose for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
go in , speak unto pharaoh king of egypt , that he let the child of israel go out of he land .
and moses spake before the lord , say , behold , the child of israel have not hearken unto i ; how then shall pharaoh hear i , who be of uncircumcised lip ?
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , and give they a charge unto the child of israel , and unto pharaoh king of egypt , to bring the child of israel out of the land of egypt .

and it come to pass on the day when the lord speak unto mose in the land of egypt ,
that the lord speak unto mose , say , i be the lord : speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto thee .
and moses say before the lord , behold , i be of uncircumcised lip , and how shall pharaoh hearken unto i ?
and the lord say unto mose , see , i have make thee a god to pharaoh : and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet .
thou shalt speak all that i command thee : and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh , that he send the child of israel out of he land .
and i will harden pharaoh 's heart , and multiply my sign and my wonder in the land of egypt .
but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that i may lay my hand upon egypt , and bring forth mine army , and my people the child of israel , out of the land of egypt by great judgment .
and the egyptians shall know that i be the lord , when i stretch forth mine hand upon egypt , and bring out the child of israel from among they .
and moses and aaron do as the lord command they , so do they .
and moses be fourscore year old , and aaron fourscore and three year old , when they speak unto pharaoh .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
when pharaoh shall speak unto you , say , shew a miracle for you : then thou shalt say unto aaron , take thy rod , and cast it before pharaoh , and it shall become a serpent .
and moses and aaron go in unto pharaoh , and they do so as the lord have command : and aaron cast down he rod before pharaoh , and before he servant , and it become a serpent .
then pharaoh also call the wise man and the sorcerer : now the magician of egypt , they also do in like manner with they enchantment .
for they cast down every man he rod , and they become serpent : but aaron 's rod swallow up they rod .
and he harden pharaoh 's heart , that he hearken not unto they ; as the lord have say .
and the lord say unto mose , pharaoh 's heart be harden , he refuseth to let the people go .
get thee unto pharaoh in the morning ; lo , he goeth out unto the water ; and thou shalt stand by the river 's brink against he come ; and the rod which be turn to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand .
and thou shalt say unto he , the lord god of the hebrews have send i unto thee , say , let my people go , that they may serve i in the wilderness : and , behold , hitherto thou wouldest not hear .
thus saith the lord , in this thou shalt know that i be the lord : behold , i will smite with the rod that be in mine hand upon the water which be in the river , and they shall be turn to blood .
and the fish that be in the river shall die , and the river shall stink ; and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river .
and the lord speak unto mose , say unto aaron , take thy rod , and stretch out thine hand upon the water of egypt , upon they stream , upon they river , and upon they pond , and upon all they pool of water , that they may become blood ; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of egypt , both in vessel of wood , and in vessel of stone .
and moses and aaron do so , as the lord command ; and he lift up the rod , and smite the water that be in the river , in the sight of pharaoh , and in the sight of he servant ; and all the water that be in the river be turn to blood .
and the fish that be in the river die ; and the river stank , and the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there be blood throughout all the land of egypt .
and the magician of egypt do so with they enchantment : and pharaoh 's heart be harden , neither do he hearken unto they ; as the lord have say .
and pharaoh turn and go into he house , neither do he set he heart to this also .
and all the egyptians dig round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
and seven day be fulfil , after that the lord have smite the river .
and the lord speak unto mose , go unto pharaoh , and say unto he , thus saith the lord , let my people go , that they may serve i .
and if thou refuse to let they go , behold , i will smite all thy border with frog :
and the river shall bring forth frog abundantly , which shall go up and come into thine house , and into thy bedchamber , and upon thy bed , and into the house of thy servant , and upon thy people , and into thine oven , and into thy kneadingtrough :
and the frog shall come up both on thee , and upon thy people , and upon all thy servant .
and the lord speak unto mose , say unto aaron , stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the stream , over the river , and over the pond , and cause frog to come up upon the land of egypt .
and aaron stretch out he hand over the water of egypt ; and the frog come up , and cover the land of egypt .
and the magician do so with they enchantment , and bring up frog upon the land of egypt .
then pharaoh call for mose and aaron , and say , intreat the lord , that he may take away the frog from i , and from my people ; and i will let the people go , that they may do sacrifice unto the lord .
and moses say unto pharaoh , glory over i : when shall i intreat for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy people , to destroy the frog from thee and thy house , that they may remain in the river only ?
and he say , to morrow .
and he say , be it accord to thy word : that thou mayest know that there be none like unto the lord we god .
and the frog shall depart from thee , and from thy house , and from thy servant , and from thy people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and moses and aaron go out from pharaoh : and moses cry unto the lord because of the frog which he have bring against pharaoh .
and the lord do accord to the word of moses ; and the frog die out of the house , out of the village , and out of the field .
and they gather they together upon heap : and the land stank .
but when pharaoh see that there be respite , he harden he heart , and hearken not unto they ; as the lord have say .
and the lord say unto mose , say unto aaron , stretch out thy rod , and smite the dust of the land , that it may become louse throughout all the land of egypt .
and they do so ; for aaron stretch out he hand with he rod , and smite the dust of the earth , and it become louse in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land become louse throughout all the land of egypt .
and the magician do so with they enchantment to bring forth louse , but they could not : so there be louse upon man , and upon beast .
then the magician say unto pharaoh , this be the finger of god : and pharaoh 's heart be harden , and he hearken not unto they ; as the lord have say .
and the lord say unto mose , rise up early in the morning , and stand before pharaoh ; lo , he cometh forth to the water ; and say unto he , thus saith the lord , let my people go , that they may serve i .
else , if thou wilt not let my people go , behold , i will send swarm of fly upon thee , and upon thy servant , and upon thy people , and into thy house : and the house of the egyptians shall be full of swarm of fly , and also the ground whereon they be .
and i will sever in that day the land of goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarm of fly shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that i be the lord in the midst of the earth .
and i will put a division between my people and thy people : to morrow shall this sign be .
and the lord do so ; and there come a grievous swarm of fly into the house of pharaoh , and into he servant ' house , and into all the land of egypt : the land be corrupt by reason of the swarm of fly .
and pharaoh call for moses and for aaron , and say , go ye , sacrifice to you god in the land .
and moses say , it be not meet so to do ; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord we god : lo , shall we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before they eye , and will they not stone we ?
we will go three day ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to the lord we god , as he shall command we .
and pharaoh say , i will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the lord you god in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : intreat for i .
and moses say , behold , i go out from thee , and i will intreat the lord that the swarm of fly may depart from pharaoh , from he servant , and from he people , to morrow : but let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not let the people go to sacrifice to the lord .
and moses go out from pharaoh , and intreat the lord .
and the lord do accord to the word of moses ; and he remove the swarm of fly from pharaoh , from he servant , and from he people ; there remain not one .
and pharaoh harden he heart at this time also , neither would he let the people go .
then the lord say unto mose , go in unto pharaoh , and tell he , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , let my people go , that they may serve i .
for if thou refuse to let they go , and wilt hold they still ,
behold , the hand of the lord be upon thy cattle which be in the field , upon the horse , upon the ass , upon the camel , upon the ox , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very grievous murrain .
and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that be the child 's of israel .
and the lord appoint a set time , say , to morrow the lord shall do this thing in the land .
and the lord do that thing on the morrow , and all the cattle of egypt die : but of the cattle of the child of israel die not one .
and pharaoh send , and , behold , there be not one of the cattle of the israelites dead .
and the heart of pharaoh be harden , and he do not let the people go .
and the lord say unto mose and unto aaron , take to you handful of ash of the furnace , and let mose sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of pharaoh .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt , and shall be a boil break forth with blain upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of egypt .
and they take ash of the furnace , and stand before pharaoh ; and moses sprinkle it up toward heaven ; and it become a boil break forth with blain upon man , and upon beast .
and the magician could not stand before mose because of the boil ; for the boil be upon the magician , and upon all the egyptians .
and the lord harden the heart of pharaoh , and he hearken not unto they ; as the lord have speak unto mose .
and the lord say unto mose , rise up early in the morning , and stand before pharaoh , and say unto he , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , let my people go , that they may serve i .
for i will at this time send all my plague upon thine heart , and upon thy servant , and upon thy people ; that thou mayest know that there be none like i in all the earth .
for now i will stretch out my hand , that i may smite thee and thy people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
and in very deed for this cause have i raise thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declare throughout all the earth .
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people , that thou wilt not let they go ?
behold , to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as have not be in egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
send therefore now , and gather thy cattle , and all that thou hast in the field ; for upon every man and beast which shall be find in the field , and shall not be bring home , the hail shall come down upon they , and they shall die .
he that fear the word of the lord among the servant of pharaoh make he servant and he cattle flee into the house :
and he that regard not the word of the lord leave he servant and he cattle in the field .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch forth thine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of egypt , upon man , and upon beast , and upon every herb of the field , throughout the land of egypt .
and moses stretch forth he rod toward heaven : and the lord send thunder and hail , and the fire run along upon the ground ; and the lord rain hail upon the land of egypt .
so there be hail , and fire mingle with the hail , very grievous , such as there be none like it in all the land of egypt since it become a nation .
and the hail smite throughout all the land of egypt all that be in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smite every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
only in the land of goshen , where the child of israel be , be there no hail .
and pharaoh send , and call for mose and aaron , and say unto they , i have sin this time : the lord be righteous , and i and my people be wicked .
intreat the lord ( for it be enough ) that there be no more mighty thundering and hail ; and i will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
and moses say unto he , as soon as i be go out of the city , i will spread abroad my hand unto the lord ; and the thunder shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that thou mayest know how that the earth be the lord 's .
but as for thee and thy servant , i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god .
and the flax and the barley be smitten : for the barley be in the ear , and the flax be boll .
but the wheat and the rie be not smitten : for they be not grow up .
and moses go out of the city from pharaoh , and spread abroad he hand unto the lord : and the thunder and hail cease , and the rain be not pour upon the earth .
and when pharaoh see that the rain and the hail and the thunder be cease , he sin yet more , and harden he heart , he and he servant .
and the heart of pharaoh be harden , neither would he let the child of israel go ; as the lord have speak by moses .
and the lord say unto mose , go in unto pharaoh : for i have harden he heart , and the heart of he servant , that i might shew these my sign before he :
and that thou mayest tell in the ear of thy son , and of thy son 's son , what thing i have work in egypt , and my sign which i have do among they ; that ye may know how that i be the lord .
and moses and aaron come in unto pharaoh , and say unto he , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before i ? let my people go , that they may serve i .
else , if thou refuse to let my people go , behold , to morrow will i bring the locust into thy coast :
and they shall cover the face of the earth , that one can not be able to see the earth : and they shall eat the residue of that which be escape , which remaineth unto you from the hail , and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field :
and they shall fill thy house , and the house of all thy servant , and the house of all the egyptians ; which neither thy father , nor thy father ' father have see , since the day that they be upon the earth unto this day .
and he turn himself , and go out from pharaoh .
and pharaoh 's servant say unto he , how long shall this man be a snare unto we ? let the man go , that they may serve the lord they god : knowest thou not yet that egypt be destroy ?
and moses and aaron be bring again unto pharaoh : and he say unto they , go , serve the lord you god : but who be they that shall go ?
and moses say , we will go with we young and with we old , with we son and with we daughter , with we flock and with we herd will we go ; for we must hold a feast unto the lord .
and he say unto they , let the lord be so with you , as i will let you go , and you little one : look to it ; for evil be before you .
not so : go now ye that be man , and serve the lord ; for that ye do desire .
and they be drive out from pharaoh 's presence .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch out thine hand over the land of egypt for the locust , that they may come up upon the land of egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail have leave .
and moses stretch forth he rod over the land of egypt , and the lord bring a east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it be morning , the east wind bring the locust .
and the locust go up over all the land of egypt , and rest in all the coast of egypt : very grievous be they ; before they there be no such locust as they , neither after they shall be such .
for they cover the face of the whole earth , so that the land be darken ; and they do eat every herb of the land , and all the fruit of the tree which the hail have leave : and there remain not any green thing in the tree , or in the herb of the field , through all the land of egypt .
then pharaoh call for mose and aaron in haste ; and he say , i have sin against the lord you god , and against you .
now therefore forgive , i pray thee , my sin only this once , and intreat the lord you god , that he may take away from i this death only .
and he go out from pharaoh , and intreat the lord .
and the lord turn a mighty strong west wind , which take away the locust , and cast they into the red sea ; there remain not one locust in all the coast of egypt .
but the lord harden pharaoh 's heart , so that he would not let the child of israel go .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch out thine hand toward heaven , that there may be darkness over the land of egypt , even darkness which may be feel .
and moses stretch forth he hand toward heaven ; and there be a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three day :
they see not one another , neither rise any from he place for three day : but all the child of israel have light in they dwelling .
and pharaoh call unto mose , and say , go ye , serve the lord ; only let you flock and you herd be stay : let you little one also go with you .
and moses say , thou must give we also sacrifice and burnt offering , that we may sacrifice unto the lord we god .
we cattle also shall go with we ; there shall not a hoof be leave behind ; for thereof must we take to serve the lord we god ; and we know not with what we must serve the lord , until we come thither .
but the lord harden pharaoh 's heart , and he would not let they go .
and pharaoh say unto he , get thee from i , take heed to thyself , see my face no more ; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die .
and moses say , thou hast speak well , i will see thy face again no more .
and the lord say unto mose , yet will i bring one plague more upon pharaoh , and upon egypt ; afterwards he will let you go hence : when he shall let you go , he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether .
speak now in the ear of the people , and let every man borrow of he neighbour , and every woman of she neighbour , jewel of silver , and jewel of gold .
and the lord give the people favour in the sight of the egyptians .
moreover the man moses be very great in the land of egypt , in the sight of pharaoh 's servant , and in the sight of the people .
and moses say , thus saith the lord , about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt :
and all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die , from the first bear of pharaoh that sitteth upon he throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that be behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of beast .
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt , such as there be none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
but against any of the child of israel shall not a dog move he tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the lord doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel .
and all these thy servant shall come down unto i , and bow down themselves unto i , say , get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that i will go out .
and he go out from pharaoh in a great anger .
and the lord say unto mose , pharaoh shall not hearken unto you ; that my wonder may be multiply in the land of egypt .
and moses and aaron do all these wonder before pharaoh : and the lord harden pharaoh 's heart , so that he would not let the child of israel go out of he land .
and the lord speak unto mose and aaron in the land of egypt , say ,
this month shall be unto you the beginning of month : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
speak ye unto all the congregation of israel , say , in the tenth day of this month they shall take to they every man a lamb , accord to the house of they father , a lamb for a house :
and if the household be too little for the lamb , let he and he neighbour next unto he house take it accord to the number of the soul ; every man accord to he eating shall make you count for the lamb .
you lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goat :
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side post and on the upper door post of the house , wherein they shall eat it .
and they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; and with bitter herb they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roast with fire ; he head with he leg , and with the purtenance thereof .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with you loin gird , you shoe on you foot , and you staff in you hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste : it be the lord 's passover .
for i will pass through the land of egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the god of egypt i will execute judgment : i be the lord .
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the house where ye be : and when i see the blood , i will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when i smite the land of egypt .
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout you generation ; ye shall keep it a feast by a ordinance for ever .
seven day shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of you house : for whosoever eateth leaven bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from israel .
and in the first day there shall be a holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be do in they , save that which every man must eat , that only may be do of you .
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this selfsame day have i bring you army out of the land of egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in you generation by a ordinance for ever .
in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at even , ye shall eat unleavened bread , until the one and twentieth day of the month at even .
seven day shall there be no leaven find in you house : for whosoever eateth that which be leaven , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel , whether he be a stranger , or bear in the land .
ye shall eat nothing leaven ; in all you habitation shall ye eat unleavened bread .
then moses call for all the elder of israel , and say unto they , draw out and take you a lamb accord to you family , and kill the passover .
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that be in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side post with the blood that be in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of he house until the morning .
for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians ; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel , and on the two side post , the lord will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto you house to smite you .
and ye shall observe this thing for a ordinance to thee and to thy son for ever .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you , accord as he have promise , that ye shall keep this service .
and it shall come to pass , when you child shall say unto you , what mean ye by this service ?
that ye shall say , it be the sacrifice of the lord 's passover , who pass over the house of the child of israel in egypt , when he smite the egyptians , and deliver we house .
and the people bow the head and worship .
and the child of israel go away , and do as the lord have command moses and aaron , so do they .
and it come to pass , that at midnight the lord smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt , from the firstborn of pharaoh that sit on he throne unto the firstborn of the captive that be in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of cattle .
and pharaoh rise up in the night , he , and all he servant , and all the egyptians ; and there be a great cry in egypt ; for there be not a house where there be not one dead .
and he call for moses and aaron by night , and say , rise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the child of israel ; and go , serve the lord , as ye have say .
also take you flock and you herd , as ye have say , and be go ; and bless i also .
and the egyptians be urgent upon the people , that they might send they out of the land in haste ; for they say , we be all dead man .
and the people take they dough before it be leaven , they kneadingtrough be bind up in they clothes upon they shoulder .
and the child of israel do accord to the word of moses ; and they borrow of the egyptians jewel of silver , and jewel of gold , and raiment :
and the lord give the people favour in the sight of the egyptians , so that they lend unto they such thing as they require .
and they spoil the egyptians .
and the child of israel journey from rameses to succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that be man , beside child .
and a mixed multitude go up also with they ; and flock , and herd , even very much cattle .
and they baked unleavened cake of the dough which they bring forth out of egypt , for it be not leaven ; because they be thrust out of egypt , and could not tarry , neither have they prepare for themselves any victual .
now the sojourning of the child of israel , who dwell in egypt , be four hundred and thirty year .
and it come to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty year , even the selfsame day it come to pass , that all the host of the lord go out from the land of egypt .
it be a night to be much observe unto the lord for bring they out from the land of egypt : this be that night of the lord to be observe of all the child of israel in they generation .
and the lord say unto mose and aaron , this be the ordinance of the passover : there shall no stranger eat thereof :
but every man 's servant that be buy for money , when thou hast circumcise he , then shall he eat thereof .
a foreigner and a hire servant shall not eat thereof .
in one house shall it be eat ; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
all the congregation of israel shall keep it .
and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee , and will keep the passover to the lord , let all he male be circumcise , and then let he come near and keep it ; and he shall be as one that be bear in the land : for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof .
one law shall be to he that be homeborn , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you .
thus do all the child of israel ; as the lord command moses and aaron , so do they .
and it come to pass the selfsame day , that the lord do bring the child of israel out of the land of egypt by they army .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
sanctify unto i all the firstborn , whatsoever openeth the womb among the child of israel , both of man and of beast : it be mine .
and moses say unto the people , remember this day , in which ye come out from egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the lord bring you out from this place : there shall no leavened bread be eat .
this day come ye out in the month abib .
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites , and the hittites , and the amorites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , which he sware unto thy father to give thee , a land flow with milk and honey , that thou shalt keep this service in this month .
seven day thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord .
unleavened bread shall be eat seven day ; and there shall no leavened bread be see with thee , neither shall there be leaven see with thee in all thy quarter .
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day , say , this be do because of that which the lord do unto i when i come forth out of egypt .
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eye , that the lord 's law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hand have the lord bring thee out of egypt .
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in he season from year to year .
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites , as he sware unto thee and to thy father , and shall give it thee ,
that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the matrix , and every firstle that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the male shall be the lord 's .
and every firstling of a ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb ; and if thou wilt not redeem it , then thou shalt break he neck : and all the firstborn of man among thy child shalt thou redeem .
and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come , say , what be this ? that thou shalt say unto he , by strength of hand the lord bring we out from egypt , from the house of bondage :
and it come to pass , when pharaoh would hardly let we go , that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt , both the firstborn of man , and the firstborn of beast : therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the matrix , be male ; but all the firstborn of my child i redeem .
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand , and for frontlet between thine eye : for by strength of hand the lord bring we forth out of egypt .
and it come to pass , when pharaoh have let the people go , that god lead they not through the way of the land of the philistines , although that be near ; for god say , lest peradventure the people repent when they see war , and they return to egypt :
but god lead the people about , through the way of the wilderness of the red sea : and the child of israel go up harness out of the land of egypt .
and moses take the bone of joseph with he : for he have straitly swear the child of israel , say , god will surely visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bone away hence with you .
and they take they journey from succoth , and encamp in etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
and the lord go before they by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead they the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give they light ; to go by day and night :
he take not away the pillar of the cloud by day , nor the pillar of fire by night , from before the people .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , that they turn and encamp before pihahiroth , between migdol and the sea , over against baalzephon : before it shall ye encamp by the sea .
for pharaoh will say of the child of israel , they be entangled in the land , the wilderness have shut they in .
and i will harden pharaoh 's heart , that he shall follow after they ; and i will be honour upon pharaoh , and upon all he host ; that the egyptians may know that i be the lord .
and they do so .
and it be tell the king of egypt that the people flee : and the heart of pharaoh and of he servant be turn against the people , and they say , why have we do this , that we have let israel go from serve we ?
and he make ready he chariot , and take he people with he :
and he take six hundred choose chariot , and all the chariot of egypt , and captain over every one of they .
and the lord harden the heart of pharaoh king of egypt , and he pursue after the child of israel : and the child of israel go out with a high hand .
but the egyptians pursue after they , all the horse and chariot of pharaoh , and he horseman , and he army , and overtake they encamp by the sea , beside pihahiroth , before baalzephon .
and when pharaoh draw nigh , the child of israel lift up they eye , and , behold , the egyptians march after they ; and they be sore afraid : and the child of israel cry out unto the lord .
and they say unto mose , because there be no grave in egypt , hast thou take we away to die in the wilderness ? wherefore hast thou deal thus with we , to carry we forth out of egypt ?
be not this the word that we do tell thee in egypt , say , let we alone , that we may serve the egyptians ?
for it have be better for we to serve the egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
and moses say unto the people , fear ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the lord , which he will shew to you to day : for the egyptians whom ye have see to day , ye shall see they again no more for ever .
the lord shall fight for you , and ye shall hold you peace .
and the lord say unto moses , wherefore criest thou unto i ? speak unto the child of israel , that they go forward :
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the child of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and i , behold , i will harden the heart of the egyptians , and they shall follow they : and i will get i honour upon pharaoh , and upon all he host , upon he chariot , and upon he horseman .
and the egyptians shall know that i be the lord , when i have get i honour upon pharaoh , upon he chariot , and upon he horseman .
and the angel of god , which go before the camp of israel , remove and go behind they ; and the pillar of the cloud go from before they face , and stand behind they :
and it come between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel ; and it be a cloud and darkness to they , but it give light by night to these : so that the one come not near the other all the night .
and moses stretch out he hand over the sea ; and the lord cause the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and make the sea dry land , and the water be divide .
and the child of israel go into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the water be a wall unto they on they right hand , and on they leave .
and the egyptians pursue , and go in after they to the midst of the sea , even all pharaoh 's horse , he chariot , and he horseman .
and it come to pass , that in the morning watch the lord look unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and trouble the host of the egyptians ,
and take off they chariot wheel , that they drave they heavily : so that the egyptians say , let we flee from the face of israel ; for the lord fighteth for they against the egyptians .
and the lord say unto mose , stretch out thine hand over the sea , that the water may come again upon the egyptians , upon they chariot , and upon they horseman .
and moses stretch forth he hand over the sea , and the sea return to he strength when the morning appear ; and the egyptians flee against it ; and the lord overthrow the egyptians in the midst of the sea .
and the water return , and cover the chariot , and the horseman , and all the host of pharaoh that come into the sea after they ; there remain not so much as one of they .
but the child of israel walk upon dry land in the midst of the sea ; and the water be a wall unto they on they right hand , and on they leave .
thus the lord save israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians ; and israel see the egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
and israel see that great work which the lord do upon the egyptians : and the people fear the lord , and believe the lord , and he servant mose .
then sing moses and the child of israel this song unto the lord , and spake , say , i will sing unto the lord , for he have triumph gloriously : the horse and he rider have he throw into the sea .
the lord be my strength and song , and he be become my salvation : he be my god , and i will prepare he a habitation ; my father 's god , and i will exalt he .
the lord be a man of war : the lord be he name .
pharaoh 's chariot and he host have he cast into the sea : he choose captain also be drown in the red sea .
the depths have cover they : they sink into the bottom as a stone .
thy right hand , o lord , be become glorious in power : thy right hand , o lord , have dash in piece the enemy .
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrow they that rise up against thee : thou sentest forth thy wrath , which consume they as stubble .
and with the blast of thy nostril the water be gather together , the flood stand upright as a heap , and the depths be congeal in the heart of the sea .
the enemy say , i will pursue , i will overtake , i will divide the spoil ; my lust shall be satisfy upon they ; i will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy they .
thou didst blow with thy wind , the sea cover they : they sink as lead in the mighty water .
who be like unto thee , o lord , among the god ? who be like thee , glorious in holiness , fearful in praise , do wonder ?
thou stretchedst out thy right hand , the earth swallow they .
thou in thy mercy hast lead forth the people which thou hast redeem : thou hast guide they in thy strength unto thy holy habitation .
the people shall hear , and be afraid : sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitant of palestina .
then the duke of edom shall be amaze ; the mighty man of moab , tremble shall take hold upon they ; all the inhabitant of canaan shall melt away .
fear and dread shall fall upon they ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till thy people pass over , o lord , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchase .
thou shalt bring they in , and plant they in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , o lord , which thou hast make for thee to dwell in , in the sanctuary , o lord , which thy hand have establish .
the lord shall reign for ever and ever .
for the horse of pharaoh go in with he chariot and with he horseman into the sea , and the lord bring again the water of the sea upon they ; but the child of israel go on dry land in the midst of the sea .
and miriam the prophetess , the sister of aaron , take a timbrel in she hand ; and all the woman go out after she with timbrel and with dance .
and miriam answer they , sing ye to the lord , for he have triumph gloriously ; the horse and he rider have he throw into the sea .
so mose bring israel from the red sea , and they go out into the wilderness of shur ; and they go three day in the wilderness , and find no water .
and when they come to marah , they could not drink of the water of marah , for they be bitter : therefore the name of it be call marah .
and the people murmur against moses , say , what shall we drink ?
and he cry unto the lord ; and the lord shew he a tree , which when he have cast into the water , the water be make sweet : there he make for they a statute and a ordinance , and there he prove they ,
and say , if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god , and wilt do that which be right in he sight , and wilt give ear to he commandment , and keep all he statute , i will put none of these disease upon thee , which i have bring upon the egyptians : for i be the lord that healeth thee .
and they come to elim , where be twelve well of water , and threescore and ten palm tree : and they encamp there by the water .
and they take they journey from elim , and all the congregation of the child of israel come unto the wilderness of sin , which be between elim and sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after they depart out of the land of egypt .
and the whole congregation of the child of israel murmur against moses and aaron in the wilderness :
and the child of israel say unto they , would to god we have die by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt , when we sit by the flesh pot , and when we do eat bread to the full ; for ye have bring we forth into this wilderness , to kill this whole assembly with hunger .
then say the lord unto moses , behold , i will rain bread from heaven for you ; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day , that i may prove they , whether they will walk in my law , or no. .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and moses and aaron say unto all the child of israel , at even , then ye shall know that the lord have bring you out from the land of egypt :
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the lord ; for that he heareth you murmuring against the lord : and what be we , that ye murmur against we ?
and moses say , this shall be , when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat , and in the morning bread to the full ; for that the lord heareth you murmuring which ye murmur against he : and what be we ? you murmuring be not against we , but against the lord .
and moses spake unto aaron , say unto all the congregation of the child of israel , come near before the lord : for he have hear you murmuring .
and it come to pass , as aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the child of israel , that they look toward the wilderness , and , behold , the glory of the lord appear in the cloud .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
i have hear the murmuring of the child of israel : speak unto they , say , at even ye shall eat flesh , and in the morning ye shall be fill with bread ; and ye shall know that i be the lord you god .
and it come to pass , that at even the quail come up , and cover the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when the dew that lay be go up , behold , upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing , as small as the hoar frost on the ground .
and when the child of israel see it , they say one to another , it be manna : for they wist not what it be .
and moses say unto they , this be the bread which the lord have give you to eat .
this be the thing which the lord have command , gather of it every man accord to he eating , a omer for every man , accord to the number of you person ; take ye every man for they which be in he tent .
and the child of israel do so , and gather , some more , some less .
and when they do mete it with a omer , he that gather much have nothing over , and he that gather little have no lack ; they gather every man accord to he eating .
and moses say , let no man leave of it till the morning .
notwithstanding they hearken not unto mose ; but some of they leave of it until the morning , and it breed worm , and stank : and moses be wroth with they .
and they gather it every morning , every man accord to he eating : and when the sun wax hot , it melt .
and it come to pass , that on the sixth day they gather twice as much bread , two omer for one man : and all the ruler of the congregation come and tell moses .
and he say unto they , this be that which the lord have say , to morrow be the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord : bake that which ye will bake to day , and seethe that ye will seethe ; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be keep until the morning .
and they lay it up till the morning , as moses bid : and it do not stink , neither be there any worm therein .
and moses say , eat that to day ; for to day be a sabbath unto the lord : to day ye shall not find it in the field .
six day ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which be the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
and it come to pass , that there go out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather , and they find none .
and the lord say unto mose , how long refuse ye to keep my commandment and my law ?
see , for that the lord have give you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two day ; abide ye every man in he place , let no man go out of he place on the seventh day .
so the people rest on the seventh day .
and the house of israel call the name thereof manna : and it be like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it be like wafer make with honey .
and moses say , this be the thing which the lord commandeth , fill a omer of it to be keep for you generation ; that they may see the bread wherewith i have feed you in the wilderness , when i bring you forth from the land of egypt .
and moses say unto aaron , take a pot , and put a omer full of manna therein , and lay it up before the lord , to be keep for you generation .
as the lord command moses , so aaron lay it up before the testimony , to be keep .
and the child of israel do eat manna forty year , until they come to a land inhabit ; they do eat manna , until they come unto the border of the land of canaan .
now a omer be the tenth part of a ephah .
and all the congregation of the child of israel journey from the wilderness of sin , after they journey , accord to the commandment of the lord , and pitch in rephidim : and there be no water for the people to drink .
wherefore the people do chide with mose , and say , give we water that we may drink .
and moses say unto they , why chide ye with i ? wherefore do ye tempt the lord ?
and the people thirst there for water ; and the people murmur against moses , and say , wherefore be this that thou hast bring we up out of egypt , to kill we and we child and we cattle with thirst ?
and moses cry unto the lord , say , what shall i do unto this people ? they be almost ready to stone i .
and the lord say unto mose , go on before the people , and take with thee of the elder of israel ; and thy rod , wherewith thou smotest the river , take in thine hand , and go .
behold , i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink .
and moses do so in the sight of the elder of israel .
and he call the name of the place massah , and meribah , because of the chiding of the child of israel , and because they tempt the lord , say , be the lord among we , or not ?
then come amalek , and fight with israel in rephidim .
and moses say unto joshua , choose we out man , and go out , fight with amalek : to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in mine hand .
so joshua do as moses have say to he , and fight with amalek : and moses , aaron , and hur go up to the top of the hill .
and it come to pass , when moses hold up he hand , that israel prevail : and when he let down he hand , amalek prevail .
but moses ' hand be heavy ; and they take a stone , and put it under he , and he sit thereon ; and aaron and hur stay up he hand , the one on the one side , and the other on the other side ; and he hand be steady until the go down of the sun .
and joshua discomfited amalek and he people with the edge of the sword .
and the lord say unto mose , write this for a memorial in a book , and rehearse it in the ear of joshua : for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven .
and moses build a altar , and call the name of it jehovahnissus :
for he say , because the lord have swear that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation .
when jethro , the priest of midian , moses ' father in law , hear of all that god have do for moses , and for israel he people , and that the lord have bring israel out of egypt ;
then jethro , moses ' father in law , take zipporah , moses ' wife , after he have send she back ,
and she two son ; of which the name of the one be gershom ; for he say , i have be a alien in a strange land :
and the name of the other be eliezer ; for the god of my father , say he , be mine help , and deliver i from the sword of pharaoh :
and jethro , moses ' father in law , come with he son and he wife unto mose into the wilderness , where he encamp at the mount of god :
and he say unto mose , i thy father in law jethro be come unto thee , and thy wife , and she two son with she .
and moses go out to meet he father in law , and do obeisance , and kiss he ; and they ask each other of they welfare ; and they come into the tent .
and moses tell he father in law all that the lord have do unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israel 's sake , and all the travail that have come upon they by the way , and how the lord deliver they .
and jethro rejoice for all the goodness which the lord have do to israel , whom he have deliver out of the hand of the egyptians .
and jethro say , blessed be the lord , who have deliver you out of the hand of the egyptians , and out of the hand of pharaoh , who have deliver the people from under the hand of the egyptians .
now i know that the lord be greater than all god : for in the thing wherein they deal proudly he be above they .
and jethro , moses ' father in law , take a burnt offering and sacrifice for god : and aaron come , and all the elder of israel , to eat bread with mose ' father in law before god .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that mose sit to judge the people : and the people stand by mose from the morning unto the evening .
and when moses ' father in law see all that he do to the people , he say , what be this thing that thou doest to the people ? why sittest thou thyself alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ?
and moses say unto he father in law , because the people come unto i to enquire of god :
when they have a matter , they come unto i ; and i judge between one and another , and i do make they know the statute of god , and he law .
and moses ' father in law say unto he , the thing that thou doest be not good .
thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that be with thee : for this thing be too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
hearken now unto my voice , i will give thee counsel , and god shall be with thee : be thou for the people to god-ward , that thou mayest bring the cause unto god :
and thou shalt teach they ordinance and law , and shalt shew they the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able man , such as fear god , man of truth , hate covetousness ; and place such over they , to be ruler of thousand , and ruler of hundred , ruler of fifty , and ruler of ten :
and let they judge the people at all season : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
if thou shalt do this thing , and god command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to they place in peace .
so mose hearken to the voice of he father in law , and do all that he have say .
and moses choose able man out of all israel , and make they head over the people , ruler of thousand , ruler of hundred , ruler of fifty , and ruler of ten .
and they judge the people at all season : the hard cause they bring unto mose , but every small matter they judge themselves .
and moses let he father in law depart ; and he go he way into he own land .
in the third month , when the child of israel be go forth out of the land of egypt , the same day come they into the wilderness of sinai .
for they be depart from rephidim , and be come to the desert of sinai , and have pitch in the wilderness ; and there israel camp before the mount .
and moses go up unto god , and the lord call unto he out of the mountain , say , thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob , and tell the child of israel ;
ye have see what i do unto the egyptians , and how i bare you on eagle ' wing , and bring you unto myself .
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto i above all people : for all the earth be mine :
and ye shall be unto i a kingdom of priest , and a holy nation .
these be the word which thou shalt speak unto the child of israel .
and moses come and call for the elder of the people , and lay before they face all these word which the lord command he .
and all the people answer together , and say , all that the lord have speak we will do .
and moses return the word of the people unto the lord .
and the lord say unto mose , lo , i come unto thee in a thick cloud , that the people may hear when i speak with thee , and believe thee for ever .
and moses tell the word of the people unto the lord .
and the lord say unto mose , go unto the people , and sanctify they to day and to morrow , and let they wash they clothes ,
and be ready against the third day : for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai .
and thou shalt set bound unto the people round about , say , take heed to yourselve , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death :
there shall not a hand touch it , but he shall surely be stone , or shoot through ; whether it be beast or man , it shall not live : when the trumpet soundeth long , they shall come up to the mount .
and moses go down from the mount unto the people , and sanctify the people ; and they wash they clothes .
and he say unto the people , be ready against the third day : come not at you wife .
and it come to pass on the third day in the morning , that there be thunder and lightning , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceed loud ; so that all the people that be in the camp tremble .
and moses bring forth the people out of the camp to meet with god ; and they stand at the nether part of the mount .
and mount sinai be altogether on a smoke , because the lord descend upon it in fire : and the smoke thereof ascend as the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mount quake greatly .
and when the voice of the trumpet sound long , and wax louder and louder , moses spake , and god answer he by a voice .
and the lord come down upon mount sinai , on the top of the mount : and the lord call moses up to the top of the mount ; and moses go up .
and the lord say unto mose , go down , charge the people , lest they break through unto the lord to gaze , and many of they perish .
and let the priest also , which come near to the lord , sanctify themselves , lest the lord break forth upon they .
and moses say unto the lord , the people can not come up to mount sinai : for thou chargedst we , say , set bound about the mount , and sanctify it .
and the lord say unto he , away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and aaron with thee : but let not the priest and the people break through to come up unto the lord , lest he break forth upon they .
so moses go down unto the people , and spake unto they .
and god speak all these word , say ,
i be the lord thy god , which have bring thee out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondage .
thou shalt have no other god before i .
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that be in heaven above , or that be in the earth beneath , or that be in the water under the earth :
thou shalt not bow down thyself to they , nor serve they : for i the lord thy god be a jealous god , visit the iniquity of the father upon the child unto the third and fourth generation of they that hate i ;
and shew mercy unto thousand of they that love i , and keep my commandment .
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain ; for the lord will not hold he guiltless that taketh he name in vain .
remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy .
six day shalt thou labour , and do all thy work :
but the seventh day be the sabbath of the lord thy god : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that be within thy gate :
for in six day the lord make heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in they be , and rest the seventh day : wherefore the lord bless the sabbath day , and hallowed it .
honour thy father and thy mother : that thy day may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
thou shalt not kill .
thou shalt not commit adultery .
thou shalt not steal .
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour .
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's wife , nor he manservant , nor he maidservant , nor he ox , nor he ass , nor any thing that be thy neighbour 's .
and all the people see the thundering , and the lightning , and the noise of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking : and when the people see it , they remove , and stand afar off .
and they say unto mose , speak thou with we , and we will hear : but let not god speak with we , lest we die .
and moses say unto the people , fear not : for god be come to prove you , and that he fear may be before you face , that ye sin not .
and the people stand afar off , and moses draw near unto the thick darkness where god be .
and the lord say unto mose , thus thou shalt say unto the child of israel , ye have see that i have talk with you from heaven .
ye shall not make with i god of silver , neither shall ye make unto you god of gold .
a altar of earth thou shalt make unto i , and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offering , and thy peace offering , thy sheep , and thine ox : in all place where i record my name i will come unto thee , and i will bless thee .
and if thou wilt make i a altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hew stone : for if thou lift up thy tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
neither shalt thou go up by step unto mine altar , that thy nakedness be not discover thereon .
now these be the judgment which thou shalt set before they .
if thou buy a hebrew servant , six year he shall serve : and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing .
if he come in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he be marry , then he wife shall go out with he .
if he master have give he a wife , and she have bear he son or daughter ; the wife and she child shall be she master 's , and he shall go out by himself .
and if the servant shall plainly say , i love my master , my wife , and my child ; i will not go out free :
then he master shall bring he unto the judge ; he shall also bring he to the door , or unto the door post ; and he master shall bear he ear through with a aul ; and he shall serve he for ever .
and if a man sell he daughter to be a maidservant , she shall not go out as the manservant do .
if she please not she master , who have betroth she to himself , then shall he let she be redeem : to sell she unto a strange nation he shall have no power , see he have deal deceitfully with she .
and if he have betroth she unto he son , he shall deal with she after the manner of daughter .
if he take he another wife ; she food , she raiment , and she duty of marriage , shall he not diminish .
and if he do not these three unto she , then shall she go out free without money .
he that smiteth a man , so that he die , shall be surely put to death .
and if a man lie not in wait , but god deliver he into he hand ; then i will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
but if a man come presumptuously upon he neighbour , to slay he with guile ; thou shalt take he from mine altar , that he may die .
and he that smiteth he father , or he mother , shall be surely put to death .
and he that stealeth a man , and selleth he , or if he be find in he hand , he shall surely be put to death .
and he that curseth he father , or he mother , shall surely be put to death .
and if man strive together , and one smite another with a stone , or with he fist , and he die not , but keepeth he bed :
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon he staff , then shall he that smite he be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of he time , and shall cause he to be thoroughly heal .
and if a man smite he servant , or he maid , with a rod , and he die under he hand ; he shall be surely punish .
notwithstanding , if he continue a day or two , he shall not be punish : for he be he money .
if man strive , and hurt a woman with child , so that she fruit depart from she , and yet no mischief follow : he shall be surely punish , accord as the woman 's husband will lay upon he ; and he shall pay as the judge determine .
and if any mischief follow , then thou shalt give life for life ,
eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ,
burning for burning , wound for wound , stripe for stripe .
and if a man smite the eye of he servant , or the eye of he maid , that it perish ; he shall let he go free for he eye 's sake .
and if he smite out he manservant 's tooth , or he maidservant 's tooth ; he shall let he go free for he tooth 's sake .
if a ox gore a man or a woman , that they die : then the ox shall be surely stone , and he flesh shall not be eat ; but the owner of the ox shall be quit .
but if the ox be wont to push with he horn in time past , and it have be testify to he owner , and he have not keep he in , but that he have kill a man or a woman ; the ox shall be stone , and he owner also shall be put to death .
if there be lay on he a sum of money , then he shall give for the ransom of he life whatsoever be lay upon he .
whether he have gore a son , or have gore a daughter , accord to this judgment shall it be do unto he .
if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant ; he shall give unto they master thirty shekel of silver , and the ox shall be stone .
and if a man shall open a pit , or if a man shall dig a pit , and not cover it , and a ox or a ass fall therein ;
the owner of the pit shall make it good , and give money unto the owner of they ; and the dead beast shall be he .
and if one man 's ox hurt another 's , that he die ; then they shall sell the live ox , and divide the money of it ; and the dead ox also they shall divide .
or if it be know that the ox have use to push in time past , and he owner have not keep he in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be he own .
if a man shall steal a ox , or a sheep , and kill it , or sell it ; he shall restore five ox for a ox , and four sheep for a sheep .
if a thief be find break up , and be smite that he die , there shall no blood be shed for he .
if the sun be rise upon he , there shall be blood shed for he ; for he should make full restitution ; if he have nothing , then he shall be sell for he theft .
if the theft be certainly find in he hand alive , whether it be ox , or ass , or sheep ; he shall restore double .
if a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eat , and shall put in he beast , and shall feed in another man 's field ; of the best of he own field , and of the best of he own vineyard , shall he make restitution .
if fire break out , and catch in thorn , so that the stack of corn , or the standing corn , or the field , be consume therewith ; he that kindle the fire shall surely make restitution .
if a man shall deliver unto he neighbour money or stuff to keep , and it be steal out of the man 's house ; if the thief be find , let he pay double .
if the thief be not find , then the master of the house shall be bring unto the judge , to see whether he have put he hand unto he neighbour 's goods .
for all manner of trespass , whether it be for ox , for ass , for sheep , for raiment , or for any manner of lose thing , which another challengeth to be he , the cause of both party shall come before the judge ; and whom the judge shall condemn , he shall pay double unto he neighbour .
if a man deliver unto he neighbour a ass , or a ox , or a sheep , or any beast , to keep ; and it die , or be hurt , or drive away , no man see it :
then shall a oath of the lord be between they both , that he have not put he hand unto he neighbour 's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
and if it be steal from he , he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof .
if it be tear in piece , then let he bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which be tear .
and if a man borrow ought of he neighbour , and it be hurt , or die , the owner thereof be not with it , he shall surely make it good .
but if the owner thereof be with it , he shall not make it good : if it be a hire thing , it come for he hire .
and if a man entice a maid that be not betroth , and lie with she , he shall surely endow she to be he wife .
if she father utterly refuse to give she unto he , he shall pay money accord to the dowry of virgin .

ye shall keep the sabbath therefore ; for it be holy unto you : every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death : for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among he people .
six day may work be do ; but in the seventh be the sabbath of rest , holy to the lord : whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
wherefore the child of israel shall keep the sabbath , to observe the sabbath throughout they generation , for a perpetual covenant .

and he give unto mose , when he have make a end of commune with he upon mount sinai , two table of testimony , table of stone , write with the finger of god .
and when the people see that mose delay to come down out of the mount , the people gather themselves together unto aaron , and say unto he , up , make we god , which shall go before we ; for as for this moses , the man that bring we up out of the land of egypt , we wot not what be become of he .
and aaron say unto they , break off the golden earring , which be in the ear of you wife , of you son , and of you daughter , and bring they unto i .
and all the people brake off the golden earring which be in they ear , and bring they unto aaron .
and he receive they at they hand , and fashion it with a graving tool , after he have make it a molten calf : and they say , these be thy god , o israel , which bring thee up out of the land of egypt .
and when aaron see it , he build a altar before it ; and aaron make proclamation , and say , to morrow be a feast to the lord .
and they rise up early on the morrow , and offer burnt offering , and bring peace offering ; and the people sit down to eat and to drink , and rise up to play .
and the lord say unto mose , go , get thee down ; for thy people , which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt , have corrupt themselves :
they have turn aside quickly out of the way which i command they : they have make they a molten calf , and have worship it , and have sacrifice thereunto , and say , these be thy god , o israel , which have bring thee up out of the land of egypt .
and the lord say unto mose , i have see this people , and , behold , it be a stiffnecked people :
now therefore let i alone , that my wrath may wax hot against they , and that i may consume they : and i will make of thee a great nation .
and moses beseech the lord he god , and say , lord , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people , which thou hast bring forth out of the land of egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
wherefore should the egyptians speak , and say , for mischief do he bring they out , to slay they in the mountain , and to consume they from the face of the earth ?
turn from thy fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against thy people .
remember abraham , isaac , and israel , thy servant , to whom thou swarest by thine own self , and saidst unto they , i will multiply you seed as the star of heaven , and all this land that i have speak of will i give unto you seed , and they shall inherit it for ever .
and the lord repent of the evil which he think to do unto he people .
and moses turn , and go down from the mount , and the two table of the testimony be in he hand : the table be write on both they side ; on the one side and on the other be they write .
and the table be the work of god , and the writing be the writing of god , grave upon the table .
and when joshua hear the noise of the people as they shout , he say unto mose , there be a noise of war in the camp .
and he say , it be not the voice of they that shout for mastery , neither be it the voice of they that cry for be overcome : but the noise of they that sing do i hear .
and it come to pass , as soon as he come nigh unto the camp , that he see the calf , and the dancing : and moses ' anger wax hot , and he cast the table out of he hand , and brake they beneath the mount .
and he take the calf which they have make , and burn it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and straw it upon the water , and make the child of israel drink of it .
and moses say unto aaron , what do this people unto thee , that thou hast bring so great a sin upon they ?
and aaron say , let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they be set on mischief .
for they say unto i , make we god , which shall go before we : for as for this moses , the man that bring we up out of the land of egypt , we wot not what be become of he .
and i say unto they , whosoever have any gold , let they break it off .
so they give it i : then i cast it into the fire , and there come out this calf .
and when moses see that the people be naked ; ( for aaron have make they naked unto they shame among they enemy : )
then moses stand in the gate of the camp , and say , who be on the lord 's side ? let he come unto i .
and all the son of levi gather themselves together unto he .
and he say unto they , thus saith the lord god of israel , put every man he sword by he side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man he brother , and every man he companion , and every man he neighbour .
and the child of levi do accord to the word of moses : and there fall of the people that day about three thousand man .
for mose have say , consecrate yourselve today to the lord , even every man upon he son , and upon he brother ; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that mose say unto the people , ye have sin a great sin : and now i will go up unto the lord ; peradventure i shall make a atonement for you sin .
and moses return unto the lord , and say , oh , this people have sin a great sin , and have make they god of gold .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive they sin ; and if not , blot i , i pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast write .
and the lord say unto mose , whosoever have sin against i , he will i blot out of my book .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which i have speak unto thee : behold , mine angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit they sin upon they .
and the lord plague the people , because they make the calf , which aaron make .
and the lord say unto mose , depart , and go up hence , thou and the people which thou hast bring up out of the land of egypt , unto the land which i sware unto abraham , to isaac , and to jacob , say , unto thy seed will i give it :
and i will send a angel before thee ; and i will drive out the canaanite , the amorite , and the hittite , and the perizzite , the hivite , and the jebusite :
unto a land flow with milk and honey : for i will not go up in the midst of thee ; for thou art a stiffnecked people : lest i consume thee in the way .
and when the people hear these evil tiding , they mourn : and no man do put on he he ornament .
for the lord have say unto mose , say unto the child of israel , ye be a stiffnecked people : i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment , and consume thee : therefore now put off thy ornament from thee , that i may know what to do unto thee .
and the child of israel strip themselves of they ornament by the mount horeb .
and moses take the tabernacle , and pitch it without the camp , afar off from the camp , and call it the tabernacle of the congregation .
and it come to pass , that every one which seek the lord go out unto the tabernacle of the congregation , which be without the camp .
and it come to pass , when moses go out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rise up , and stand every man at he tent door , and look after moses , until he be go into the tabernacle .
and it come to pass , as moses enter into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descend , and stand at the door of the tabernacle , and the lord talk with mose .
and all the people see the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door : and all the people rise up and worship , every man in he tent door .
and the lord speak unto mose face to face , as a man speaketh unto he friend .
and he turn again into the camp : but he servant joshua , the son of nun , a young man , depart not out of the tabernacle .
and moses say unto the lord , see , thou sayest unto i , bring up this people : and thou hast not let i know whom thou wilt send with i .
yet thou hast say , i know thee by name , and thou hast also find grace in my sight .
now therefore , i pray thee , if i have find grace in thy sight , shew i now thy way , that i may know thee , that i may find grace in thy sight : and consider that this nation be thy people .
and he say , my presence shall go with thee , and i will give thee rest .
and he say unto he , if thy presence go not with i , carry we not up hence .
for wherein shall it be know here that i and thy people have find grace in thy sight ? be it not in that thou goest with we ? so shall we be separate , i and thy people , from all the people that be upon the face of the earth .
and the lord say unto mose , i will do this thing also that thou hast speak : for thou hast find grace in my sight , and i know thee by name .
and he say , i beseech thee , shew i thy glory .
and he say , i will make all my goodness pass before thee , and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee ; and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious , and will shew mercy on whom i will shew mercy .
and he say , thou canst not see my face : for there shall no man see i , and live .
and the lord say , behold , there be a place by i , and thou shalt stand upon a rock :
and it shall come to pass , while my glory passeth by , that i will put thee in a clift of the rock , and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by :
and i will take away mine hand , and thou shalt see my back part : but my face shall not be see .
and the lord say unto mose , hew thee two table of stone like unto the first : and i will write upon these table the word that be in the first table , which thou brakest .
and be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount sinai , and present thyself there to i in the top of the mount .
and no man shall come up with thee , neither let any man be see throughout all the mount ; neither let the flock nor herd feed before that mount .
and he hew two table of stone like unto the first ; and moses rise up early in the morning , and go up unto mount sinai , as the lord have command he , and take in he hand the two table of stone .
and the lord descend in the cloud , and stand with he there , and proclaim the name of the lord .
and the lord pass by before he , and proclaim , the lord , the lord god , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness and truth ,
keep mercy for thousand , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visit the iniquity of the father upon the child , and upon the child 's child , unto the third and to the fourth generation .
and moses make haste , and bow he head toward the earth , and worship .
and he say , if now i have find grace in thy sight , o lord , let my lord , i pray thee , go among we ; for it be a stiffnecked people ; and pardon we iniquity and we sin , and take we for thine inheritance .
and he say , behold , i make a covenant : before all thy people i will do marvel , such as have not be do in all the earth , nor in any nation : and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord : for it be a terrible thing that i will do with thee .
observe thou that which i command thee this day : behold , i drive out before thee the amorite , and the canaanite , and the hittite , and the perizzite , and the hivite , and the jebusite .
take heed to thyself , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
but ye shall destroy they altar , break they image , and cut down they grove :
for thou shalt worship no other god : for the lord , whose name be jealous , be a jealous god :
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land , and they go a whoring after they god , and do sacrifice unto they god , and one call thee , and thou eat of he sacrifice ;
and thou take of they daughter unto thy son , and they daughter go a whoring after they god , and make thy son go a whoring after they god .
thou shalt make thee no molten god .
the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep .
seven day thou shalt eat unleavened bread , as i command thee , in the time of the month abib : for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt .
all that openeth the matrix be mine ; and every firstling among thy cattle , whether ox or sheep , that be male .
but the firstling of a ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb : and if thou redeem he not , then shalt thou break he neck .
all the firstborn of thy son thou shalt redeem .
and none shall appear before i empty .
six day thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
and thou shalt observe the feast of week , of the firstfruit of wheat harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the year 's end .
thrice in the year shall all you menchildren appear before the lord god , the god of israel .
for i will cast out the nation before thee , and enlarge thy border : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be leave unto the morning .
the first of the firstfruit of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god .
thou shalt not seethe a kid in he mother 's milk .
and the lord say unto mose , write thou these word : for after the tenor of these word i have make a covenant with thee and with israel .
and he be there with the lord forty day and forty night ; he do neither eat bread , nor drink water .
and he write upon the table the word of the covenant , the ten commandment .
and it come to pass , when moses come down from mount sinai with the two table of testimony in moses ' hand , when he come down from the mount , that mose wist not that the skin of he face shone while he talk with he .
and when aaron and all the child of israel see moses , behold , the skin of he face shone ; and they be afraid to come nigh he .
and moses call unto they ; and aaron and all the ruler of the congregation return unto he : and moses talk with they .
and afterward all the child of israel come nigh : and he give they in commandment all that the lord have speak with he in mount sinai .
and till moses have do speak with they , he put a vail on he face .
but when moses go in before the lord to speak with he , he take the vail off , until he come out .

if the bright spot be white in the skin of he flesh , and in sight be not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turn white ; then the priest shall shut up he that have the plague seven day :
and the priest shall look on he the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague in he sight be at a stay , and the plague spread not in the skin ; then the priest shall shut he up seven day more :
and the priest shall look on he again the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague be somewhat dark , and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pronounce he clean : it be but a scab : and he shall wash he clothes , and be clean .

then the priest shall consider : and , behold , if the leprosy have cover all he flesh , he shall pronounce he clean that have the plague : it be all turn white : he be clean .
but when raw flesh appeareth in he , he shall be unclean .
and the priest shall see the raw flesh , and pronounce he to be unclean : for the raw flesh be unclean : it be a leprosy .
or if the raw flesh turn again , and be change unto white , he shall come unto the priest ;
and the priest shall see he : and , behold , if the plague be turn into white ; then the priest shall pronounce he clean that have the plague : he be clean .

and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the lord .

and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel , or of the stranger that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut he off from among he people .
for the life of the flesh be in the blood : and i have give it to you upon the altar to make a atonement for you soul : for it be the blood that maketh a atonement for the soul .
therefore i say unto the child of israel , no soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood .
and whatsoever man there be of the child of israel , or of the stranger that sojourn among you , which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eat ; he shall even pour out the blood thereof , and cover it with dust .
for it be the life of all flesh ; the blood of it be for the life thereof : therefore i say unto the child of israel , ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh : for the life of all flesh be the blood thereof : whosoever eateth it shall be cut off .
and every soul that eateth that which die of itself , or that which be tear with beast , whether it be one of you own country , or a stranger , he shall both wash he clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even : then shall he be clean .

neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith : neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto : it be confusion .
defile not ye yourselve in any of these thing : for in all these the nation be defile which i cast out before you :

ye shall therefore keep my statute and my judgment , and shall not commit any of these abomination ; neither any of you own nation , nor any stranger that sojourneth among you :
( for all these abomination have the man of the land do , which be before you , and the land be defile ; )

therefore every one that eateth it shall bear he iniquity , because he have profane the hallowed thing of the lord : and that soul shall be cut off from among he people .
and when ye reap the harvest of you land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest .
and thou shalt not glean thy vineyard , neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard ; thou shalt leave they for the poor and stranger : i be the lord you god .

and they put he in ward , that the mind of the lord might be shew they .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,

and he that killeth a beast shall make it good ; beast for beast .

ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger , as for one of you own country : for i be the lord you god .

and the lord speak unto mose in mount sinai , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye come into the land which i give you , then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord .
six year thou shalt sow thy field , and six year thou shalt prune thy vineyard , and gather in the fruit thereof ;
but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the lord : thou shalt neither sow thy field , nor prune thy vineyard .
that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grape of thy vine undress : for it be a year of rest unto the land .
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hire servant , and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee ,
and for thy cattle , and for the beast that be in thy land , shall all the increase thereof be meat .
and thou shalt number seven sabbath of year unto thee , seven time seven year ; and the space of the seven sabbath of year shall be unto thee forty and nine year .
then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all you land .
and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitant thereof : it shall be a jubile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto he possession , and ye shall return every man unto he family .
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grape in it of thy vine undressed .
for it be the jubile ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto he possession .
and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour , or buyest ought of thy neighbour 's hand , ye shall not oppress one another :
accord to the number of year after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour , and accord unto the number of year of the fruit he shall sell unto thee :
accord to the multitude of year thou shalt increase the price thereof , and accord to the fewness of year thou shalt diminish the price of it : for accord to the number of the year of the fruit doth he sell unto thee .
ye shall not therefore oppress one another ; but thou shalt fear thy god : for i be the lord you god .
wherefore ye shall do my statute , and keep my judgment , and do they ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
and the land shall yield she fruit , and ye shall eat you fill , and dwell therein in safety .
and if ye shall say , what shall we eat the seventh year ? behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in we increase :

and ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until she fruit come in ye shall eat of the old store .
the land shall not be sell for ever : for the land be mine ; for ye be stranger and sojourner with i .
and in all the land of you possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land .
if thy brother be waxen poor , and have sell away some of he possession , and if any of he kin come to redeem it , then shall he redeem that which he brother sell .
and if the man have none to redeem it , and himself be able to redeem it ;
then let he count the year of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sell it ; that he may return unto he possession .
but if he be not able to restore it to he , then that which be sell shall remain in the hand of he that have buy it until the year of jubile : and in the jubile it shall go out , and he shall return unto he possession .
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it be sell ; within a full year may he redeem it .
and if it be not redeem within the space of a full year , then the house that be in the walled city shall be establish for ever to he that buy it throughout he generation : it shall not go out in the jubile .
but the house of the village which have no wall round about they shall be count as the field of the country : they may be redeem , and they shall go out in the jubile .
notwithstanding the city of the levites , and the house of the city of they possession , may the levites redeem at any time .
and if a man purchase of the levites , then the house that be sell , and the city of he possession , shall go out in the year of jubile : for the house of the city of the levites be they possession among the child of israel .
but the field of the suburb of they city may not be sell ; for it be they perpetual possession .
and if thy brother be waxen poor , and fall in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve he : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
take thou no usury of he , or increase : but fear thy god ; that thy brother may live with thee .
thou shalt not give he thy money upon usury , nor lend he thy victuals for increase .
i be the lord you god , which bring you forth out of the land of egypt , to give you the land of canaan , and to be you god .
and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor , and be sell unto thee ; thou shalt not compel he to serve as a bondservant :
but as a hire servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile :
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and he child with he , and shall return unto he own family , and unto the possession of he father shall he return .
for they be my servant , which i bring forth out of the land of egypt : they shall not be sell as bondman .
thou shalt not rule over he with rigour ; but shalt fear thy god .
both thy bondmen , and thy bondmaid , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that be round about you ; of they shall ye buy bondman and bondmaid .
moreover of the child of the stranger that do sojourn among you , of they shall ye buy , and of they family that be with you , which they beget in you land : and they shall be you possession .
and ye shall take they as a inheritance for you child after you , to inherit they for a possession ; they shall be you bondman for ever : but over you brethren the child of israel , ye shall not rule one over another with rigour .
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwelleth by he wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger 's family :
after that he be sell he may be redeem again ; one of he brethren may redeem he :
either he uncle , or he uncle 's son , may redeem he , or any that be nigh of kin unto he of he family may redeem he ; or if he be able , he may redeem himself .
and he shall reckon with he that buy he from the year that he be sell to he unto the year of jubile : and the price of he sale shall be accord unto the number of year , accord to the time of a hire servant shall it be with he .
if there be yet many year behind , accord unto they he shall give again the price of he redemption out of the money that he be buy for .
and if there remain but few year unto the year of jubile , then he shall count with he , and accord unto he year shall he give he again the price of he redemption .
and as a yearly hire servant shall he be with he : and the other shall not rule with rigour over he in thy sight .
and if he be not redeem in these year , then he shall go out in the year of jubile , both he , and he child with he .
for unto i the child of israel be servant ; they be my servant whom i bring forth out of the land of egypt : i be the lord you god .
ye shall make you no idol nor graven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in you land , to bow down unto it : for i be the lord you god .
ye shall keep my sabbath , and reverence my sanctuary : i be the lord .
if ye walk in my statute , and keep my commandment , and do they ;
then i will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield she increase , and the tree of the field shall yield they fruit .
and you threshing shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time : and ye shall eat you bread to the full , and dwell in you land safely .
and i will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and i will rid evil beast out of the land , neither shall the sword go through you land .
and ye shall chase you enemy , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
and five of you shall chase a hundred , and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and you enemy shall fall before you by the sword .
for i will have respect unto you , and make you fruitful , and multiply you , and establish my covenant with you .
and ye shall eat old store , and bring forth the old because of the new .
and i will set my tabernacle among you : and my soul shall not abhor you .
and i will walk among you , and will be you god , and ye shall be my people .
i be the lord you god , which bring you forth out of the land of egypt , that ye should not be they bondman ; and i have break the band of you yoke , and make you go upright .
but if ye will not hearken unto i , and will not do all these commandment ;
and if ye shall despise my statute , or if you soul abhor my judgment , so that ye will not do all my commandment , but that ye break my covenant :
i also will do this unto you ; i will even appoint over you terror , consumption , and the burning ague , that shall consume the eye , and cause sorrow of heart : and ye shall sow you seed in vain , for you enemy shall eat it .
and i will set my face against you , and ye shall be slay before you enemy : they that hate you shall reign over you ; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you .
and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto i , then i will punish you seven time more for you sin .
and i will break the pride of you power ; and i will make you heaven as iron , and you earth as brass :
and you strength shall be spend in vain : for you land shall not yield she increase , neither shall the tree of the land yield they fruit .
and if ye walk contrary unto i , and will not hearken unto i ; i will bring seven time more plague upon you accord to you sin .
i will also send wild beast among you , which shall rob you of you child , and destroy you cattle , and make you few in number ; and you high way shall be desolate .
and if ye will not be reform by i by these thing , but will walk contrary unto i ;
then will i also walk contrary unto you , and will punish you yet seven time for you sin .
and i will bring a sword upon you , that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant : and when ye be gather together within you city , i will send the pestilence among you ; and ye shall be deliver into the hand of the enemy .
and when i have break the staff of you bread , ten woman shall bake you bread in one oven , and they shall deliver you you bread again by weight : and ye shall eat , and not be satisfy .
and if ye will not for all this hearken unto i , but walk contrary unto i ;
then i will walk contrary unto you also in fury ; and i , even i , will chastise you seven time for you sin .
and ye shall eat the flesh of you son , and the flesh of you daughter shall ye eat .
and i will destroy you high place , and cut down you image , and cast you carcase upon the carcase of you idol , and my soul shall abhor you .
and i will make you city waste , and bring you sanctuary unto desolation , and i will not smell the savour of you sweet odour .
and i will bring the land into desolation : and you enemy which dwell therein shall be astonish at it .
and i will scatter you among the heathen , and will draw out a sword after you : and you land shall be desolate , and you city waste .
then shall the land enjoy she sabbath , as long as it lieth desolate , and ye be in you enemy ' land ; even then shall the land rest , and enjoy she sabbath .
as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest ; because it do not rest in you sabbath , when ye dwelt upon it .
and upon they that be leave alive of you i will send a faintness into they heart in the land of they enemy ; and the sound of a shake leaf shall chase they ; and they shall flee , as flee from a sword ; and they shall fall when none pursueth .
and they shall fall one upon another , as it be before a sword , when none pursueth : and ye shall have no power to stand before you enemy .
and ye shall perish among the heathen , and the land of you enemy shall eat you up .
and they that be leave of you shall pine away in they iniquity in you enemy ' land ; and also in the iniquity of they father shall they pine away with they .
if they shall confess they iniquity , and the iniquity of they father , with they trespass which they trespass against i , and that also they have walk contrary unto i ;
and that i also have walk contrary unto they , and have bring they into the land of they enemy ; if then they uncircumcised heart be humble , and they then accept of the punishment of they iniquity :
then will i remember my covenant with jacob , and also my covenant with isaac , and also my covenant with abraham will i remember ; and i will remember the land .
the land also shall be leave of they , and shall enjoy she sabbath , while she lieth desolate without they : and they shall accept of the punishment of they iniquity : because , even because they despise my judgment , and because they soul abhor my statute .
and yet for all that , when they be in the land of they enemy , i will not cast they away , neither will i abhor they , to destroy they utterly , and to break my covenant with they : for i be the lord they god .
but i will for they sake remember the covenant of they ancestor , whom i bring forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the heathen , that i might be they god : i be the lord .

both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put they ; that they defile not they camp , in the midst whereof i dwell .
and the child of israel do so , and put they out without the camp : as the lord speak unto mose , so do the child of israel .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , when a man or woman shall commit any sin that man commit , to do a trespass against the lord , and that person be guilty ;
then they shall confess they sin which they have do : and he shall recompense he trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto he against whom he have trespass .
but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto , let the trespass be recompense unto the lord , even to the priest ; beside the ram of the atonement , whereby a atonement shall be make for he .
and every offering of all the holy thing of the child of israel , which they bring unto the priest , shall be he .
and every man 's hallowed thing shall be he : whatsoever any man giveth the priest , it shall be he .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,

and a man lie with she carnally , and it be hide from the eye of she husband , and be keep close , and she be defile , and there be no witness against she , neither she be take with the manner ;
and the spirit of jealousy come upon he , and he be jealous of he wife , and she be defile : or if the spirit of jealousy come upon he , and he be jealous of he wife , and she be not defile :
then shall the man bring he wife unto the priest , and he shall bring she offering for she , the tenth part of a ephah of barley meal ; he shall pour no oil upon it , nor put frankincense thereon ; for it be a offering of jealousy , a offering of memorial , bring iniquity to remembrance .
and the priest shall bring she near , and set she before the lord :
and the priest shall take holy water in a earthen vessel ; and of the dust that be in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put it into the water :
and the priest shall set the woman before the lord , and uncover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in she hand , which be the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in he hand the bitter water that causeth the curse :
and the priest shall charge she by a oath , and say unto the woman , if no man have lie with thee , and if thou hast not go aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse :
but if thou hast go aside to another instead of thy husband , and if thou be defile , and some man have lie with thee beside thine husband :
then the priest shall charge the woman with a oath of cursing , and the priest shall say unto the woman , the lord make thee a curse and a oath among thy people , when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot , and thy belly to swell ;
and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels , to make thy belly to swell , and thy thigh to rot : and the woman shall say , amen , aman .
and the priest shall write these curse in a book , and he shall blot they out with the bitter water :
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into she , and become bitter .
then the priest shall take the jealousy offer out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the lord , and offer it upon the altar :
and the priest shall take a handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .

and if the woman be not defile , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .

this be the law of the nazarite who have vow , and of he offering unto the lord for he separation , beside that that he hand shall get : accord to the vow which he vow , so he must do after the law of he separation .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto aaron and unto he son , say , on this wise ye shall bless the child of israel , say unto they ,
the lord bless thee , and keep thee :
the lord make he face shine upon thee , and be gracious unto thee :
the lord lift up he countenance upon thee , and give thee peace .
and they shall put my name upon the child of israel ; and i will bless they .

and they depart from the mount of the lord three day ' journey : and the ark of the covenant of the lord go before they in the three day ' journey , to search out a rest place for they .
and the cloud of the lord be upon they by day , when they go out of the camp .
and it come to pass , when the ark set forward , that moses say , rise up , lord , and let thine enemy be scatter ; and let they that hate thee flee before thee .
and when it rest , he say , return , o lord , unto the many thousand of israel .
and when the people complain , it displeased the lord : and the lord hear it ; and he anger be kindle ; and the fire of the lord burn among they , and consume they that be in the uttermost part of the camp .
and the people cry unto mose ; and when moses pray unto the lord , the fire be quench .
and he call the name of the place taberah : because the fire of the lord burn among they .
and the mixt multitude that be among they fall a lusting : and the child of israel also weep again , and say , who shall give we flesh to eat ?
we remember the fish , which we do eat in egypt freely ; the cucumber , and the melon , and the leek , and the onion , and the garlick :
but now we soul be dry away : there be nothing at all , beside this manna , before we eye .
and the manna be as coriander seed , and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium .
and the people go about , and gather it , and ground it in mill , or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in pan , and make cake of it : and the taste of it be as the taste of fresh oil .
and when the dew fall upon the camp in the night , the manna fall upon it .
then moses hear the people weep throughout they family , every man in the door of he tent : and the anger of the lord be kindle greatly ; moses also be displeased .
and moses say unto the lord , wherefore hast thou afflict thy servant ? and wherefore have i not find favour in thy sight , that thou layest the burden of all this people upon i ?
have i conceive all this people ? have i beget they , that thou shouldest say unto i , carry they in thy bosom , as a nursing father beareth the suck child , unto the land which thou swarest unto they father ?
whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people ? for they weep unto i , say , give we flesh , that we may eat .
i be not able to bear all this people alone , because it be too heavy for i .
and if thou deal thus with i , kill i , i pray thee , out of hand , if i have find favour in thy sight ; and let i not see my wretchedness .
and the lord say unto mose , gather unto i seventy man of the elder of israel , whom thou knowest to be the elder of the people , and officer over they ; and bring they unto the tabernacle of the congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
and i will come down and talk with thee there : and i will take of the spirit which be upon thee , and will put it upon they ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thyself alone .
and say thou unto the people , sanctify yourselve against to morrow , and ye shall eat flesh : for ye have weep in the ear of the lord , say , who shall give we flesh to eat ? for it be well with we in egypt : therefore the lord will give you flesh , and ye shall eat .
ye shall not eat one day , nor two day , nor five day , neither ten day , nor twenty day ;
but even a whole month , until it come out at you nostril , and it be loathsome unto you : because that ye have despise the lord which be among you , and have weep before he , say , why come we forth out of egypt ?
and moses say , the people , among whom i be , be six hundred thousand footman ; and thou hast say , i will give they flesh , that they may eat a whole month .
shall the flock and the herd be slay for they , to suffice they ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gather together for they , to suffice they ?
and the lord say unto mose , be the lord 's hand wax short ? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not .
and moses go out , and tell the people the word of the lord , and gather the seventy man of the elder of the people , and set they round about the tabernacle .
and the lord come down in a cloud , and spake unto he , and take of the spirit that be upon he , and give it unto the seventy elder : and it come to pass , that , when the spirit rest upon they , they prophesy , and do not cease .
but there remain two of the man in the camp , the name of the one be eldad , and the name of the other medad : and the spirit rest upon they ; and they be of they that be write , but go not out unto the tabernacle : and they prophesy in the camp .
and there run a young man , and tell moses , and say , eldad and medad do prophesy in the camp .
and joshua the son of nun , the servant of moses , one of he young man , answer and say , my lord moses , forbid they .
and moses say unto he , enviest thou for my sake ? would god that all the lord 's people be prophet , and that the lord would put he spirit upon they !
and moses gat he into the camp , he and the elder of israel .
and there go forth a wind from the lord , and bring quail from the sea , and let they fall by the camp , as it be a day 's journey on this side , and as it be a day 's journey on the other side , round about the camp , and as it be two cubit high upon the face of the earth .
and the people stand up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gather the quail : he that gather least gather ten homer : and they spread they all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and while the flesh be yet between they tooth , ere it be chew , the wrath of the lord be kindle against the people , and the lord smite the people with a very great plague .
and he call the name of that place kibrothhattaavah : because there they bury the people that lust .
and the people journey from kibrothhattaavah unto hazeroth ; and abode at hazeroth .
and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he have marry : for he have marry a ethiopian woman .
and they say , have the lord indeed speak only by moses ? have he not speak also by we ?
and the lord hear it .
( now the man moses be very meek , above all the man which be upon the face of the earth . )
and the lord spake suddenly unto moses , and unto aaron , and unto miriam , come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation .
and they three come out .
and the lord come down in the pillar of the cloud , and stand in the door of the tabernacle , and call aaron and miriam : and they both come forth .
and he say , hear now my word : if there be a prophet among you , i the lord will make myself know unto he in a vision , and will speak unto he in a dream .
my servant moses be not so , who be faithful in all mine house .
with he will i speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speech ; and the similitude of the lord shall he behold : wherefore then be ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses ?
and the anger of the lord be kindle against they ; and he depart .
and the cloud depart from off the tabernacle ; and , behold , miriam become leprous , white as snow : and aaron look upon miriam , and , behold , she be leprous .
and aaron say unto mose , alas , my lord , i beseech thee , lay not the sin upon we , wherein we have do foolishly , and wherein we have sin .
let she not be as one dead , of whom the flesh be half consume when he cometh out of he mother 's womb .
and moses cry unto the lord , say , heal she now , o god , i beseech thee .
and the lord say unto mose , if she father have but spit in she face , should she not be ashamed seven day ? let she be shut out from the camp seven day , and after that let she be receive in again .
and miriam be shut out from the camp seven day : and the people journey not till miriam be bring in again .
and afterward the people remove from hazeroth , and pitch in the wilderness of paran .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
send thou man , that they may search the land of canaan , which i give unto the child of israel : of every tribe of they father shall ye send a man , every one a ruler among they .
and moses by the commandment of the lord send they from the wilderness of paran : all those man be head of the child of israel .
and these be they name : of the tribe of reuben , shammua the son of zaccur .
of the tribe of simeon , shaphat the son of hori .
of the tribe of judah , caleb the son of jephunneh .
of the tribe of issachar , igal the son of joseph .
of the tribe of ephraim , oshea the son of nun .
of the tribe of benjamin , palti the son of raphu .
of the tribe of zebulun , gaddiel the son of sodi .
of the tribe of joseph , namely , of the tribe of manasseh , gaddi the son of susi .
of the tribe of dan , ammiel the son of gemalli .
of the tribe of asher , sethur the son of michael .
of the tribe of naphtali , nahbi the son of vophsus .
of the tribe of gad , geuel the son of machi .
these be the name of the man which moses send to spy out the land .
and moses call oshea the son of nun jehoshua .
and moses send they to spy out the land of canaan , and say unto they , get you up this way southward , and go up into the mountain :
and see the land , what it be ; and the people that dwelleth therein , whether they be strong or weak , few or many ;
and what the land be that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad ; and what city they be that they dwell in , whether in tent , or in strong hold ;
and what the land be , whether it be fat or lean , whether there be wood therein , or not .
and be ye of good courage , and bring of the fruit of the land .
now the time be the time of the firstripe grape .
so they go up , and search the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob , as man come to hamath .
and they ascend by the south , and come unto hebron ; where ahiman , sheshai , and talmai , the child of anak , be .
( now hebron be build seven year before zoan in egypt . )
and they come unto the brook of eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grape , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they bring of the pomegranate , and of the fig .
the place be call the brook eshcol , because of the cluster of grape which the child of israel cut down from thence .
and they return from search of the land after forty day .
and they go and come to moses , and to aaron , and to all the congregation of the child of israel , unto the wilderness of paran , to kadesh ; and bring back word unto they , and unto all the congregation , and shew they the fruit of the land .
and they tell he , and say , we come unto the land whither thou sentest we , and surely it floweth with milk and honey ; and this be the fruit of it .
nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land , and the city be wall , and very great : and moreover we see the child of anak there .
the amalekites dwell in the land of the south : and the hittites , and the jebusites , and the amorites , dwell in the mountain : and the canaanites dwell by the sea , and by the coast of jordan .
and caleb still the people before mose , and say , let we go up at once , and possess it ; for we be well able to overcome it .
but the man that go up with he say , we be not able to go up against the people ; for they be stronger than we .
and they bring up a evil report of the land which they have search unto the child of israel , say , the land , through which we have go to search it , be a land that eateth up the inhabitant thereof ; and all the people that we see in it be man of a great stature .
and there we see the giant , the son of anak , which come of the giant : and we be in we own sight as grasshopper , and so we be in they sight .
and all the congregation lift up they voice , and cry ; and the people weep that night .
and all the child of israel murmur against moses and against aaron : and the whole congregation say unto they , would god that we have die in the land of egypt ! or would god we have die in this wilderness !
and wherefore have the lord bring we unto this land , to fall by the sword , that we wife and we child should be a prey ? be it not better for we to return into egypt ?
and they say one to another , let we make a captain , and let we return into egypt .
then moses and aaron fall on they face before all the assembly of the congregation of the child of israel .
and joshua the son of nun , and caleb the son of jephunneh , which be of they that search the land , rent they clothes :
and they speak unto all the company of the child of israel , say , the land , which we pass through to search it , be a exceed good land .
if the lord delight in we , then he will bring we into this land , and give it we ; a land which floweth with milk and honey .
only rebel not ye against the lord , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they be bread for we : they defence be depart from they , and the lord be with we : fear they not .
but all the congregation bid stone they with stone .
and the glory of the lord appear in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the child of israel .
and the lord say unto mose , how long will this people provoke i ? and how long will it be ere they believe i , for all the sign which i have shew among they ?
i will smite they with the pestilence , and disinherit they , and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they .
and moses say unto the lord , then the egyptians shall hear it , ( for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among they ; )
and they will tell it to the inhabitant of this land : for they have hear that thou lord art among this people , that thou lord art see face to face , and that thy cloud standeth over they , and that thou goest before they , by day time in a pillar of a cloud , and in a pillar of fire by night .
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nation which have hear the fame of thee will speak , say ,
because the lord be not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto they , therefore he have slay they in the wilderness .
and now , i beseech thee , let the power of my lord be great , accord as thou hast speak , say ,
the lord be longsuffer , and of great mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression , and by no means clear the guilty , visit the iniquity of the father upon the child unto the third and fourth generation .
pardon , i beseech thee , the iniquity of this people accord unto the greatness of thy mercy , and as thou hast forgive this people , from egypt even until now .
and the lord say , i have pardon accord to thy word :
but as truly as i live , all the earth shall be fill with the glory of the lord .
because all those man which have see my glory , and my miracle , which i do in egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempt i now these ten time , and have not hearken to my voice ;
surely they shall not see the land which i sware unto they father , neither shall any of they that provoke i see it :
but my servant caleb , because he have another spirit with he , and have follow i fully , he will i bring into the land whereinto he go ; and he seed shall possess it .
( now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valley . )
tomorrow turn you , and get you into the wilderness by the way of the red sea .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
how long shall i bear with this evil congregation , which murmur against i ?
i have hear the murmuring of the child of israel , which they murmur against i .
say unto they , as truly as i live , saith the lord , as ye have speak in mine ear , so will i do to you :
you carcase shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that be number of you , accord to you whole number , from twenty year old and upward , which have murmur against i ,
doubtless ye shall not come into the land , concern which i sware to make you dwell therein , save caleb the son of jephunneh , and joshua the son of nun .
but you little one , which ye say should be a prey , they will i bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have despise .
but as for you , you carcase , they shall fall in this wilderness .
and you child shall wander in the wilderness forty year , and bear you whoredom , until you carcase be waste in the wilderness .
after the number of the day in which ye search the land , even forty day , each day for a year , shall ye bear you iniquity , even forty year , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
i the lord have say , i will surely do it unto all this evil congregation , that be gather together against i : in this wilderness they shall be consume , and there they shall die .
and the man , which moses send to search the land , who return , and make all the congregation to murmur against he , by bring up a slander upon the land ,
even those man that do bring up the evil report upon the land , die by the plague before the lord .
but joshua the son of nun , and caleb the son of jephunneh , which be of the man that go to search the land , live still .
and moses tell these saying unto all the child of israel : and the people mourn greatly .
and they rise up early in the morning , and gat they up into the top of the mountain , say , lo , we be here , and will go up unto the place which the lord have promise : for we have sin .
and moses say , wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the lord ? but it shall not prosper .
go not up , for the lord be not among you ; that ye be not smite before you enemy .
for the amalekites and the canaanites be there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword : because ye be turn away from the lord , therefore the lord will not be with you .
but they presume to go up unto the hill top : nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the lord , and moses , depart not out of the camp .
then the amalekites come down , and the canaanites which dwell in that hill , and smite they , and discomfited they , even unto hormah .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye be come into the land of you habitation , which i give unto you ,
and will make a offering by fire unto the lord , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice in perform a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in you solemn feast , to make a sweet savour unto the lord , of the herd , or of the flock :
then shall he that offereth he offering unto the lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingle with the fourth part of a hin of oil .
and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice , for one lamb .
or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offer two tenth deal of flour mingle with the third part of a hin of oil .
and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine , for a sweet savour unto the lord .
and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in perform a vow , or peace offering unto the lord :
then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deal of flour mingle with half a hin of oil .
and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half a hin of wine , for a offering make by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
thus shall it be do for one bullock , or for one ram , or for a lamb , or a kid .
accord to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do to every one accord to they number .
all that be bear of the country shall do these thing after this manner , in offer a offering make by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
and if a stranger sojourn with you , or whosoever be among you in you generation , and will offer a offering make by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord ; as ye do , so he shall do .
one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation , and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you , a ordinance for ever in you generation : as ye be , so shall the stranger be before the lord .
one law and one manner shall be for you , and for the stranger that sojourneth with you .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye come into the land whither i bring you ,
then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up a heave offering unto the lord .
ye shall offer up a cake of the first of you dough for a heave offering : as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor , so shall ye heave it .
of the first of you dough ye shall give unto the lord a heave offering in you generation .
and if ye have err , and not observe all these commandment , which the lord have speak unto mose ,
even all that the lord have command you by the hand of moses , from the day that the lord command moses , and henceforward among you generation ;
then it shall be , if ought be commit by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation , that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour unto the lord , with he meat offering , and he drink offering , accord to the manner , and one kid of the goat for a sin offering .
and the priest shall make a atonement for all the congregation of the child of israel , and it shall be forgive they ; for it be ignorance : and they shall bring they offering , a sacrifice make by fire unto the lord , and they sin offering before the lord , for they ignorance :
and it shall be forgive all the congregation of the child of israel , and the stranger that sojourneth among they ; see all the people be in ignorance .
and if any soul sin through ignorance , then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering .
and the priest shall make a atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord , to make a atonement for he ; and it shall be forgive he .
ye shall have one law for he that sinneth through ignorance , both for he that be bear among the child of israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among they .
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be bear in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from among he people .
because he have despise the word of the lord , and have break he commandment , that soul shall utterly be cut off ; he iniquity shall be upon he .
and while the child of israel be in the wilderness , they find a man that gather stick upon the sabbath day .
and they that find he gather stick bring he unto mose and aaron , and unto all the congregation .
and they put he in ward , because it be not declare what should be do to he .
and the lord say unto mose , the man shall be surely put to death : all the congregation shall stone he with stone without the camp .
and all the congregation bring he without the camp , and stone he with stone , and he die ; as the lord command moses .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and bid they that they make they fringe in the border of they garment throughout they generation , and that they put upon the fringe of the border a ribband of blue :
and it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the commandment of the lord , and do they ; and that ye seek not after you own heart and you own eye , after which ye use to go a whoring :
that ye may remember , and do all my commandment , and be holy unto you god .
i be the lord you god , which bring you out of the land of egypt , to be you god : i be the lord you god .
now korah , the son of izhar , the son of kohath , the son of levi , and dathan and abiram , the son of eliab , and on , the son of peleth , son of reuben , take man :
and they rise up before moses , with certain of the child of israel , two hundred and fifty prince of the assembly , famous in the congregation , man of renown :
and they gather themselves together against moses and against aaron , and say unto they , ye take too much upon you , see all the congregation be holy , every one of they , and the lord be among they : wherefore then lift ye up yourselve above the congregation of the lord ?
and when moses hear it , he fall upon he face :
and he speak unto korah and unto all he company , say , even to morrow the lord will shew who be he , and who be holy ; and will cause he to come near unto he : even he whom he have choose will he cause to come near unto he .
this do ; take you censer , korah , and all he company ;
and put fire therein , and put incense in they before the lord to morrow : and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose , he shall be holy : ye take too much upon you , ye son of levi .
and moses say unto korah , hear , i pray you , ye son of levi :
seemeth it but a small thing unto you , that the god of israel have separate you from the congregation of israel , to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto they ?
and he have bring thee near to he , and all thy brethren the son of levi with thee : and seek ye the priesthood also ?
for which cause both thou and all thy company be gather together against the lord : and what be aaron , that ye murmur against he ?
and moses send to call dathan and abiram , the son of eliab : which say , we will not come up :
be it a small thing that thou hast bring we up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill we in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over we ?
moreover thou hast not bring we into a land that floweth with milk and honey , or give we inheritance of field and vineyard : wilt thou put out the eye of these man ? we will not come up .
and moses be very wroth , and say unto the lord , respect not thou they offering : i have not take one ass from they , neither have i hurt one of they .
and moses say unto korah , be thou and all thy company before the lord , thou , and they , and aaron , to morrow :
and take every man he censer , and put incense in they , and bring ye before the lord every man he censer , two hundred and fifty censer ; thou also , and aaron , each of you he censer .
and they take every man he censer , and put fire in they , and lay incense thereon , and stand in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with mose and aaron .
and korah gather all the congregation against they unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and the glory of the lord appear unto all the congregation .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
separate yourselve from among this congregation , that i may consume they in a moment .
and they fall upon they face , and say , o god , the god of the spirit of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation ?
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the congregation , say , get you up from about the tabernacle of korah , dathan , and abiram .
and moses rise up and go unto dathan and abiram ; and the elder of israel follow he .
and he speak unto the congregation , say , depart , i pray you , from the tent of these wicked man , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consume in all they sin .
so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah , dathan , and abiram , on every side : and dathan and abiram come out , and stand in the door of they tent , and they wife , and they son , and they little child .
and moses say , hereby ye shall know that the lord have send i to do all these work ; for i have not do they of mine own mind .
if these man die the common death of all man , or if they be visit after the visitation of all man ; then the lord have not send i .
but if the lord make a new thing , and the earth open she mouth , and swallow they up , with all that appertain unto they , and they go down quick into the pit ; then ye shall understand that these man have provoke the lord .
and it come to pass , as he have make a end of speak all these word , that the ground clave asunder that be under they :
and the earth open she mouth , and swallow they up , and they house , and all the man that appertain unto korah , and all they goods .
they , and all that appertain to they , go down alive into the pit , and the earth close upon they : and they perish from among the congregation .
and all israel that be round about they flee at the cry of they : for they say , lest the earth swallow we up also .
and there come out a fire from the lord , and consume the two hundred and fifty man that offer incense .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest , that he take up the censer out of the burning , and scatter thou the fire yonder ; for they be hallowed .
the censer of these sinner against they own soul , let they make they broad plate for a covering of the altar : for they offer they before the lord , therefore they be hallowed : and they shall be a sign unto the child of israel .
and eleazar the priest take the brasen censer , wherewith they that be burn have offer ; and they be make broad plate for a covering of the altar :
to be a memorial unto the child of israel , that no stranger , which be not of the seed of aaron , come near to offer incense before the lord ; that he be not as korah , and as he company : as the lord say to he by the hand of moses .
but on the morrow all the congregation of the child of israel murmur against moses and against aaron , say , ye have kill the people of the lord .
and it come to pass , when the congregation be gather against moses and against aaron , that they look toward the tabernacle of the congregation : and , behold , the cloud cover it , and the glory of the lord appear .
and moses and aaron come before the tabernacle of the congregation .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
get you up from among this congregation , that i may consume they as in a moment .
and they fall upon they face .
and moses say unto aaron , take a censer , and put fire therein from off the altar , and put on incense , and go quickly unto the congregation , and make a atonement for they : for there be wrath go out from the lord ; the plague be begin .
and aaron take as moses command , and run into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague be begin among the people : and he put on incense , and make a atonement for the people .
and he stand between the dead and the living ; and the plague be stay .
now they that die in the plague be fourteen thousand and seven hundred , beside they that die about the matter of korah .
and aaron return unto mose unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and the plague be stay .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and take of every one of they a rod accord to the house of they father , of all they prince accord to the house of they father twelve rod : write thou every man 's name upon he rod .
and thou shalt write aaron 's name upon the rod of levi : for one rod shall be for the head of the house of they father .
and thou shalt lay they up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony , where i will meet with you .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's rod , whom i shall choose , shall blossom : and i will make to cease from i the murmuring of the child of israel , whereby they murmur against you .
and moses spake unto the child of israel , and every one of they prince give he a rod apiece , for each prince one , accord to they father ' house , even twelve rod : and the rod of aaron be among they rod .
and moses lay up the rod before the lord in the tabernacle of witness .
and it come to pass , that on the morrow moses go into the tabernacle of witness ; and , behold , the rod of aaron for the house of levi be bud , and bring forth bud , and bloom blossom , and yield almond .
and moses bring out all the rod from before the lord unto all the child of israel : and they look , and take every man he rod .
and the lord say unto mose , bring aaron 's rod again before the testimony , to be keep for a token against the rebel ; and thou shalt quite take away they murmuring from i , that they die not .
and moses do so : as the lord command he , so do he .
and the child of israel spake unto moses , say , behold , we die , we perish , we all perish .
whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord shall die : shall we be consume with die ?
and the lord say unto aaron , thou and thy son and thy father 's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary : and thou and thy son with thee shall bear the iniquity of you priesthood .
and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be join unto thee , and minister unto thee : but thou and thy son with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness .
and they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessel of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and they shall be join unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , for all the service of the tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you .
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary , and the charge of the altar : that there be no wrath any more upon the child of israel .
and i , behold , i have take you brethren the levites from among the child of israel : to you they be give as a gift for the lord , to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
therefore thou and thy son with thee shall keep you priest 's office for everything of the altar , and within the vail ; and ye shall serve : i have give you priest 's office unto you as a service of gift : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
and the lord spake unto aaron , behold , i also have give thee the charge of mine heave offering of all the hallowed thing of the child of israel ; unto thee have i give they by reason of the anointing , and to thy son , by a ordinance for ever .
this shall be thine of the most holy thing , reserve from the fire : every oblation of theirs , every meat offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto i , shall be most holy for thee and for thy son .
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it ; every male shall eat it : it shall be holy unto thee .
and this be thine ; the heave offering of they gift , with all the wave offering of the child of israel : i have give they unto thee , and to thy son and to thy daughter with thee , by a statute for ever : every one that be clean in thy house shall eat of it .
all the best of the oil , and all the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the firstfruit of they which they shall offer unto the lord , they have i give thee .
and whatsoever be first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the lord , shall be thine ; every one that be clean in thine house shall eat of it .
every thing devote in israel shall be thine .
every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh , which they bring unto the lord , whether it be of man or beast , shall be thine : nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem , and the firstling of unclean beast shalt thou redeem .
and those that be to be redeem from a month old shalt thou redeem , accord to thine estimation , for the money of five shekel , after the shekel of the sanctuary , which be twenty gerah .
but the firstling of a cow , or the firstling of a sheep , or the firstling of a goat , thou shalt not redeem ; they be holy : thou shalt sprinkle they blood upon the altar , and shalt burn they fat for a offering make by fire , for a sweet savour unto the lord .
and the flesh of they shall be thine , as the wave breast and as the right shoulder be thine .
all the heave offering of the holy thing , which the child of israel offer unto the lord , have i give thee , and thy son and thy daughter with thee , by a statute for ever : it be a covenant of salt for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee .
and the lord spake unto aaron , thou shalt have no inheritance in they land , neither shalt thou have any part among they : i be thy part and thine inheritance among the child of israel .
and , behold , i have give the child of levi all the tenth in israel for a inheritance , for they service which they serve , even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
neither must the child of israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation , lest they bear sin , and die .
but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they shall bear they iniquity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout you generation , that among the child of israel they have no inheritance .
but the tithe of the child of israel , which they offer as a heave offering unto the lord , i have give to the levites to inherit : therefore i have say unto they , among the child of israel they shall have no inheritance .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
thus speak unto the levites , and say unto they , when ye take of the child of israel the tithe which i have give you from they for you inheritance , then ye shall offer up a heave offering of it for the lord , even a tenth part of the tithe .
and this you heave offering shall be reckon unto you , as though it be the corn of the threshingfloor , and as the fulness of the winepress .
thus ye also shall offer a heave offering unto the lord of all you tithe , which ye receive of the child of israel ; and ye shall give thereof the lord 's heave offering to aaron the priest .
out of all you gift ye shall offer every heave offering of the lord , of all the best thereof , even the hallowed part thereof out of it .
therefore thou shalt say unto they , when ye have heave the best thereof from it , then it shall be count unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor , and as the increase of the winepress .
and ye shall eat it in every place , ye and you household : for it be you reward for you service in the tabernacle of the congregation .
and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it , when ye have heave from it the best of it : neither shall ye pollute the holy thing of the child of israel , lest ye die .
and the lord speak unto mose and unto aaron , say ,
this be the ordinance of the law which the lord have command , say , speak unto the child of israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without spot , wherein be no blemish , and upon which never come yoke :
and ye shall give she unto eleazar the priest , that he may bring she forth without the camp , and one shall slay she before he face :
and eleazar the priest shall take of she blood with he finger , and sprinkle of she blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven time :
and one shall burn the heifer in he sight ; she skin , and she flesh , and she blood , with she dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash he clothes , and he shall bathe he flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and he that burneth she shall wash he clothes in water , and bathe he flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the even .
and a man that be clean shall gather up the ash of the heifer , and lay they up without the camp in a clean place , and it shall be keep for the congregation of the child of israel for a water of separation : it be a purification for sin .
and he that gathereth the ash of the heifer shall wash he clothes , and be unclean until the even : and it shall be unto the child of israel , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among they , for a statute for ever .
he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven day .
he shall purify himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he purify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that be dead , and purifieth not himself , defileth the tabernacle of the lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from israel : because the water of separation be not sprinkle upon he , he shall be unclean ; he uncleanness be yet upon he .
this be the law , when a man dieth in a tent : all that come into the tent , and all that be in the tent , shall be unclean seven day .
and every open vessel , which have no cover bind upon it , be unclean .
and whosoever toucheth one that be slay with a sword in the open field , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven day .
and for a unclean person they shall take of the ash of the burnt heifer of purification for sin , and run water shall be put thereto in a vessel :
and a clean person shall take hyssop , and dip it in the water , and sprinkle it upon the tent , and upon all the vessel , and upon the person that be there , and upon he that touch a bone , or one slay , or one dead , or a grave :
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify himself , and wash he clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
but the man that shall be unclean , and shall not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation , because he have defile the sanctuary of the lord : the water of separation have not be sprinkle upon he ; he be unclean .
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto they , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash he clothes ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even .
and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean ; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even .
then come the child of israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of zin in the first month : and the people abide in kadesh ; and miriam die there , and be bury there .
and there be no water for the congregation : and they gather themselves together against moses and against aaron .
and the people chode with mose , and spake , say , would god that we have die when we brethren die before the lord !
and why have ye bring up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness , that we and we cattle should die there ?
and wherefore have ye make we to come up out of egypt , to bring we in unto this evil place ? it be no place of seed , or of fig , or of vine , or of pomegranate ; neither be there any water to drink .
and moses and aaron go from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they fall upon they face : and the glory of the lord appear unto they .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
take the rod , and gather thou the assembly together , thou , and aaron thy brother , and speak ye unto the rock before they eye ; and it shall give forth he water , and thou shalt bring forth to they water out of the rock : so thou shalt give the congregation and they beast drink .
and moses take the rod from before the lord , as he command he .
and moses and aaron gather the congregation together before the rock , and he say unto they , hear now , ye rebel ; must we fetch you water out of this rock ?
and mose lift up he hand , and with he rod he smite the rock twice : and the water come out abundantly , and the congregation drink , and they beast also .
and the lord speak unto mose and aaron , because ye believe i not , to sanctify i in the eye of the child of israel , therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have give they .
this be the water of meribah ; because the child of israel strive with the lord , and he be sanctify in they .
and moses send messenger from kadesh unto the king of edom , thus saith thy brother israel , thou knowest all the travail that have befall we :
how we father go down into egypt , and we have dwell in egypt a long time ; and the egyptians vex we , and we father :
and when we cry unto the lord , he hear we voice , and send a angel , and have bring we forth out of egypt : and , behold , we be in kadesh , a city in the uttermost of thy border :
let we pass , i pray thee , through thy country : we will not pass through the field , or through the vineyard , neither will we drink of the water of the well : we will go by the king 's high way , we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left , until we have pass thy border .
and edom say unto he , thou shalt not pass by i , lest i come out against thee with the sword .
and the child of israel say unto he , we will go by the high way : and if i and my cattle drink of thy water , then i will pay for it : i will only , without do anything else , go through on my foot .
and he say , thou shalt not go through .
and edom come out against he with much people , and with a strong hand .
thus edom refuse to give israel passage through he border : wherefore israel turn away from he .
and the child of israel , even the whole congregation , journey from kadesh , and come unto mount hor .
and the lord speak unto mose and aaron in mount hor , by the coast of the land of edom , say ,
aaron shall be gather unto he people : for he shall not enter into the land which i have give unto the child of israel , because ye rebel against my word at the water of meribah .
take aaron and eleazar he son , and bring they up unto mount hor :
and strip aaron of he garment , and put they upon eleazar he son : and aaron shall be gather unto he people , and shall die there .
and moses do as the lord command : and they go up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation .
and moses strip aaron of he garment , and put they upon eleazar he son ; and aaron die there in the top of the mount : and moses and eleazar come down from the mount .
and when all the congregation see that aaron be dead , they mourn for aaron thirty day , even all the house of israel .
and when king arad the canaanite , which dwell in the south , hear tell that israel come by the way of the spy ; then he fight against israel , and take some of they prisoner .
and israel vow a vow unto the lord , and say , if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand , then i will utterly destroy they city .
and the lord hearken to the voice of israel , and deliver up the canaanites ; and they utterly destroy they and they city : and he call the name of the place hormah .
and they journey from mount hor by the way of the red sea , to compass the land of edom : and the soul of the people be much discourage because of the way .
and the people speak against god , and against moses , wherefore have ye bring we up out of egypt to die in the wilderness ? for there be no bread , neither be there any water ; and we soul loatheth this light bread .
and the lord send fiery serpent among the people , and they bite the people ; and much people of israel die .
therefore the people come to moses , and say , we have sin , for we have speak against the lord , and against thee ; pray unto the lord , that he take away the serpent from we .
and moses pray for the people .
and the lord say unto moses , make thee a fiery serpent , and set it upon a pole : and it shall come to pass , that every one that be bite , when he looketh upon it , shall live .
and moses make a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole , and it come to pass , that if a serpent have bite any man , when he behold the serpent of brass , he live .
and the child of israel set forward , and pitch in oboth .
and they journey from oboth , and pitch at ijeabarim , in the wilderness which be before moab , toward the sunrising .
from thence they remove , and pitch in the valley of zared .
from thence they remove , and pitch on the other side of arnon , which be in the wilderness that cometh out of the coast of the amorites : for arnon be the border of moab , between moab and the amorites .
wherefore it be say in the book of the war of the lord , what he do in the red sea , and in the brook of arnon ,
and at the stream of the brook that goeth down to the dwelling of ar , and lieth upon the border of moab .
and from thence they go to beer : that be the well whereof the lord speak unto mose , gather the people together , and i will give they water .
then israel sing this song , spring up , o well ; sing ye unto it :
the prince dig the well , the noble of the people dig it , by the direction of the lawgiver , with they stave .
and from the wilderness they go to mattanah :
and from mattanah to nahaliel : and from nahaliel to bamoth :
and from bamoth in the valley , that be in the country of moab , to the top of pisgah , which looketh toward jeshimon .
and israel send messenger unto sihon king of the amorites , say ,
let i pass through thy land : we will not turn into the field , or into the vineyard ; we will not drink of the water of the well : but we will go along by the king 's high way , until we be past thy border .
and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through he border : but sihon gather all he people together , and go out against israel into the wilderness : and he come to jahaz , and fight against israel .
and israel smite he with the edge of the sword , and possess he land from arnon unto jabbok , even unto the child of ammon : for the border of the child of ammon be strong .
and israel take all these city : and israel dwelt in all the city of the amorites , in heshbon , and in all the village thereof .
for heshbon be the city of sihon the king of the amorites , who have fight against the former king of moab , and take all he land out of he hand , even unto arnon .
wherefore they that speak in proverb say , come into heshbon , let the city of sihon be build and prepare :
for there be a fire go out of heshbon , a flame from the city of sihon : it have consume ar of moab , and the lord of the high place of arnon .
woe to thee , moab ! thou art undo , o people of chemosh : he have give he son that escape , and he daughter , into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites .
we have shoot at they ; heshbon be perish even unto dibon , and we have lay they waste even unto nophah , which reacheth unto medeba .
thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites .
and moses send to spy out jaazer , and they take the village thereof , and drive out the amorites that be there .
and they turn and go up by the way of bashan : and og the king of bashan go out against they , he , and all he people , to the battle at edrei .
and the lord say unto mose , fear he not : for i have deliver he into thy hand , and all he people , and he land ; and thou shalt do to he as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites , which dwell at heshbon .
so they smite he , and he son , and all he people , until there be none leave he alive : and they possess he land .
and the child of israel set forward , and pitch in the plain of moab on this side jordan by jericho .
and balak the son of zippor see all that israel have do to the amorites .
and moab be sore afraid of the people , because they be many : and moab be distressed because of the child of israel .
and moab say unto the elder of midian , now shall this company lick up all that be round about we , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field .
and balak the son of zippor be king of the moabite at that time .
he send messenger therefore unto balaam the son of beor to pethor , which be by the river of the land of the child of he people , to call he , say , behold , there be a people come out from egypt : behold , they cover the face of the earth , and they abide over against i :
come now therefore , i pray thee , curse i this people ; for they be too mighty for i : peradventure i shall prevail , that we may smite they , and that i may drive they out of the land : for i wot that he whom thou blessest be bless , and he whom thou cursest be curse .
and the elder of moab and the elder of midian depart with the reward of divination in they hand ; and they come unto balaam , and spake unto he the word of balak .
and he say unto they , lodge here this night , and i will bring you word again , as the lord shall speak unto i : and the prince of moab abode with balaam .
and god come unto balaam , and say , what man be these with thee ?
and balaam say unto god , balak the son of zippor , king of moab , have send unto i , say ,
behold , there be a people come out of egypt , which covereth the face of the earth : come now , curse i they ; peradventure i shall be able to overcome they , and drive they out .
and god say unto balaam , thou shalt not go with they ; thou shalt not curse the people : for they be bless .
and balaam rise up in the morning , and say unto the prince of balak , get you into you land : for the lord refuseth to give i leave to go with you .
and the prince of moab rise up , and they go unto balak , and say , balaam refuseth to come with we .
and balak send yet again prince , more , and more honourable than they .
and they come to balaam , and say to he , thus saith balak the son of zippor , let nothing , i pray thee , hinder thee from come unto i :
for i will promote thee unto very great honour , and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto i : come therefore , i pray thee , curse i this people .
and balaam answer and say unto the servant of balak , if balak would give i he house full of silver and gold , i can not go beyond the word of the lord my god , to do less or more .
now therefore , i pray you , tarry ye also here this night , that i may know what the lord will say unto i more .
and god come unto balaam at night , and say unto he , if the man come to call thee , rise up , and go with they ; but yet the word which i shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
and balaam rise up in the morning , and saddle he ass , and go with the prince of moab .
and god 's anger be kindle because he go : and the angel of the lord stand in the way for a adversary against he .
now he be ride upon he ass , and he two servant be with he .
and the ass see the angel of the lord standing in the way , and he sword draw in he hand : and the ass turn aside out of the way , and go into the field : and balaam smite the ass , to turn she into the way .
but the angel of the lord stand in a path of the vineyard , a wall be on this side , and a wall on that side .
and when the ass see the angel of the lord , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed balaam 's foot against the wall : and he smite she again .
and the angel of the lord go further , and stand in a narrow place , where be no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass see the angel of the lord , she fall down under balaam : and balaam 's anger be kindle , and he smite the ass with a staff .
and the lord open the mouth of the ass , and she say unto balaam , what have i do unto thee , that thou hast smite i these three time ?
and balaam say unto the ass , because thou hast mock i : i would there be a sword in mine hand , for now would i kill thee .
and the ass say unto balaam , be not i thine ass , upon which thou hast ridden ever since i be thine unto this day ? be i ever wont to do so unto thee ?
and he say , nay .
then the lord open the eye of balaam , and he see the angel of the lord standing in the way , and he sword draw in he hand : and he bow down he head , and fall flat on he face .
and the angel of the lord say unto he , wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three time ? behold , i go out to withstand thee , because thy way be perverse before i :
and the ass see i , and turn from i these three time : unless she have turn from i , surely now also i have slay thee , and save she alive .
and balaam say unto the angel of the lord , i have sin ; for i know not that thou stoodest in the way against i : now therefore , if it displease thee , i will get i back again .
and the angel of the lord say unto balaam , go with the man : but only the word that i shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak .
so balaam go with the prince of balak .
and when balak hear that balaam be come , he go out to meet he unto a city of moab , which be in the border of arnon , which be in the utmost coast .
and balak say unto balaam , do i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee ? wherefore camest thou not unto i ? be i not able indeed to promote thee to honour ?
and balaam say unto balak , lo , i be come unto thee : have i now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that god putteth in my mouth , that shall i speak .
and balaam go with balak , and they come unto kirjathhuzoth .
and balak offer ox and sheep , and send to balaam , and to the prince that be with he .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that balak take balaam , and bring he up into the high place of baal , that thence he might see the utmost part of the people .
and balaam say unto balak , build i here seven altar , and prepare i here seven ox and seven ram .
and balak do as balaam have speak ; and balak and balaam offer on every altar a bullock and a ram .
and balaam say unto balak , stand by thy burnt offering , and i will go : peradventure the lord will come to meet i : and whatsoever he sheweth i i will tell thee .
and he go to a high place .
and god meet balaam : and he say unto he , i have prepare seven altar , and i have offer upon every altar a bullock and a ram .
and the lord put a word in balaam 's mouth , and say , return unto balak , and thus thou shalt speak .
and he return unto he , and , lo , he stand by he burnt sacrifice , he , and all the prince of moab .
and he take up he parable , and say , balak the king of moab have bring i from aram , out of the mountain of the east , say , come , curse i jacob , and come , defy israel .
how shall i curse , whom god have not curse ? or how shall i defy , whom the lord have not defy ?
for from the top of the rock i see he , and from the hill i behold he : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckon among the nation .
who can count the dust of jacob , and the number of the fourth part of israel ?
let i die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like he !
and balak say unto balaam , what hast thou do unto i ?
i take thee to curse mine enemy , and , behold , thou hast bless they altogether .
and he answer and say , must i not take heed to speak that which the lord have put in my mouth ?
and balak say unto he , come , i pray thee , with i unto another place , from whence thou mayest see they : thou shalt see but the utmost part of they , and shalt not see they all : and curse i they from thence .
and he bring he into the field of zophim , to the top of pisgah , and build seven altar , and offer a bullock and a ram on every altar .
and he say unto balak , stand here by thy burnt offering , while i meet the lord yonder .
and the lord meet balaam , and put a word in he mouth , and say , go again unto balak , and say thus .
and when he come to he , behold , he stand by he burnt offering , and the prince of moab with he .
and balak say unto he , what have the lord speak ?
and he take up he parable , and say , rise up , balak , and hear ; hearken unto i , thou son of zippor :
god be not a man , that he should lie ; neither the son of man , that he should repent : have he say , and shall he not do it ? or have he speak , and shall he not make it good ?
behold , i have receive commandment to bless : and he have bless ; and i can not reverse it .
he have not beheld iniquity in jacob , neither have he see perverseness in israel : the lord he god be with he , and the shout of a king be among they .
god bring they out of egypt ; he have as it be the strength of a unicorn .
surely there be no enchantment against jacob , neither be there any divination against israel : accord to this time it shall be say of jacob and of israel , what have god work !
behold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drink the blood of the slay .
and balak say unto balaam , neither curse they at all , nor bless they at all .
but balaam answer and say unto balak , tell not i thee , say , all that the lord speaketh , that i must do ?
and balak say unto balaam , come , i pray thee , i will bring thee unto another place ; peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse i they from thence .
and balak bring balaam unto the top of peor , that looketh toward jeshimon .
and balaam say unto balak , build i here seven altar , and prepare i here seven bullock and seven ram .
and balak do as balaam have say , and offer a bullock and a ram on every altar .
and when balaam see that it please the lord to bless israel , he go not , as at other time , to seek for enchantment , but he set he face toward the wilderness .
and balaam lift up he eye , and he see israel abide in he tent accord to they tribe ; and the spirit of god come upon he .
and he take up he parable , and say , balaam the son of beor have say , and the man whose eye be open have say :
he have say , which hear the word of god , which see the vision of the almighty , fall into a trance , but have he eye open :
how goodly be thy tent , o jacob , and thy tabernacle , o israel !
as the valley be they spread forth , as garden by the river 's side , as the tree of lign aloe which the lord have plant , and as cedar tree beside the water .
he shall pour the water out of he bucket , and he seed shall be in many water , and he king shall be higher than agag , and he kingdom shall be exalt .
god bring he forth out of egypt ; he have as it be the strength of a unicorn : he shall eat up the nation he enemy , and shall break they bone , and pierce they through with he arrow .
he couch , he lay down as a lion , and as a great lion : who shall stir he up ?
bless be he that blesseth thee , and curse be he that curseth thee .
and balak 's anger be kindle against balaam , and he smite he hand together : and balak say unto balaam , i call thee to curse mine enemy , and , behold , thou hast altogether bless they these three time .
therefore now flee thou to thy place : i think to promote thee unto great honour ; but , lo , the lord have keep thee back from honour .
and balaam say unto balak , spake i not also to thy messenger which thou sentest unto i , say ,
if balak would give i he house full of silver and gold , i can not go beyond the commandment of the lord , to do either good or bad of mine own mind ; but what the lord saith , that will i speak ?
and now , behold , i go unto my people : come therefore , and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter day .
and he take up he parable , and say , balaam the son of beor have say , and the man whose eye be open have say :
he have say , which hear the word of god , and know the knowledge of the most high , which see the vision of the almighty , fall into a trance , but have he eye open :
i shall see he , but not now : i shall behold he , but not nigh : there shall come a star out of jacob , and a sceptre shall rise out of israel , and shall smite the corner of moab , and destroy all the child of sheth .
and edom shall be a possession , seir also shall be a possession for he enemy ; and israel shall do valiantly .
out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion , and shall destroy he that remaineth of the city .
and when he look on amalek , he take up he parable , and say , amalek be the first of the nation ; but he latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
and he look on the kenites , and take up he parable , and say , strong be thy dwellingplace , and thou puttest thy nest in a rock .
nevertheless the kenite shall be waste , until asshur shall carry thee away captive .
and he take up he parable , and say , alas , who shall live when god doeth this !
and ship shall come from the coast of chittim , and shall afflict asshur , and shall afflict eber , and he also shall perish for ever .
and balaam rise up , and go and return to he place : and balak also go he way .
and israel abode in shittim , and the people begin to commit whoredom with the daughter of moab .
and they call the people unto the sacrifice of they god : and the people do eat , and bow down to they god .
and israel join himself unto baalpeor : and the anger of the lord be kindle against israel .
and the lord say unto mose , take all the head of the people , and hang they up before the lord against the sun , that the fierce anger of the lord may be turn away from israel .

if a man vow a vow unto the lord , or swear a oath to bind he soul with a bond ; he shall not break he word , he shall do accord to all that proceedeth out of he mouth .
if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord , and bind herself by a bond , be in she father 's house in she youth ;
and she father hear she vow , and she bond wherewith she have bind she soul , and she father shall hold he peace at she : then all she vow shall stand , and every bond wherewith she have bind she soul shall stand .
but if she father disallow she in the day that he heareth ; not any of she vow , or of she bond wherewith she have bind she soul , shall stand : and the lord shall forgive she , because she father disallow she .
and if she have at all a husband , when she vow , or utter ought out of she lip , wherewith she bind she soul ;
and she husband hear it , and hold he peace at she in the day that he hear it : then she vow shall stand , and she bond wherewith she bind she soul shall stand .
but if she husband disallow she on the day that he hear it ; then he shall make she vow which she vow , and that which she utter with she lip , wherewith she bind she soul , of none effect : and the lord shall forgive she .
but every vow of a widow , and of she that be divorce , wherewith they have bind they soul , shall stand against she .
and if she vow in she husband 's house , or bind she soul by a bond with a oath ;
and she husband hear it , and hold he peace at she , and disallow she not : then all she vow shall stand , and every bond wherewith she bind she soul shall stand .
but if she husband have utterly make they void on the day he hear they ; then whatsoever proceed out of she lip concern she vow , or concern the bond of she soul , shall not stand : she husband have make they void ; and the lord shall forgive she .
every vow , and every binding oath to afflict the soul , she husband may establish it , or she husband may make it void .
but if she husband altogether hold he peace at she from day to day ; then he establisheth all she vow , or all she bond , which be upon she : he confirmeth they , because he hold he peace at she in the day that he hear they .
but if he shall any way make they void after that he have hear they ; then he shall bear she iniquity .
these be the statute , which the lord command moses , between a man and he wife , between the father and he daughter , be yet in she youth in she father 's house .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
avenge the child of israel of the midianites : afterward shalt thou be gather unto thy people .
and moses spake unto the people , say , arm some of yourselve unto the war , and let they go against the midianites , and avenge the lord of midian .

and they burn all they city wherein they dwell , and all they goodly castle , with fire .
and they take all the spoil , and all the prey , both of man and of beast .
and they bring the captive , and the prey , and the spoil , unto mose , and eleazar the priest , and unto the congregation of the child of israel , unto the camp at the plain of moab , which be by jordan near jericho .
and moses , and eleazar the priest , and all the prince of the congregation , go forth to meet they without the camp .
and moses be wroth with the officer of the host , with the captain over thousand , and captain over hundred , which come from the battle .
and moses say unto they , have ye save all the woman alive ?
behold , these cause the child of israel , through the counsel of balaam , to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor , and there be a plague among the congregation of the lord .
now therefore kill every male among the little one , and kill every woman that have known man by lie with he .
but all the woman child , that have not know a man by lie with he , keep alive for yourselve .
and do ye abide without the camp seven day : whosoever have kill any person , and whosoever have touch any slay , purify both yourselve and you captive on the third day , and on the seventh day .
and purify all you raiment , and all that be make of skin , and all work of goat ' hair , and all thing make of wood .

every thing that may abide the fire , ye shall make it go through the fire , and it shall be clean : nevertheless it shall be purify with the water of separation : and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water .
and ye shall wash you clothes on the seventh day , and ye shall be clean , and afterward ye shall come into the camp .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
take the sum of the prey that be take , both of man and of beast , thou , and eleazar the priest , and the chief father of the congregation :
and divide the prey into two part ; between they that take the war upon they , who go out to battle , and between all the congregation :
and levy a tribute unto the lord of the man of war which go out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the person , and of the beef , and of the ass , and of the sheep :
take it of they half , and give it unto eleazar the priest , for a heave offering of the lord .
and of the child of israel 's half , thou shalt take one portion of fifty , of the person , of the beef , of the ass , and of the flock , of all manner of beast , and give they unto the levites , which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord .
and moses and eleazar the priest do as the lord command moses .

and the person be sixteen thousand ; of which the lord 's tribute be thirty and two person .
and moses give the tribute , which be the lord 's heave offering , unto eleazar the priest , as the lord command moses .
and of the child of israel 's half , which mose divide from the man that war ,
( now the half that pertain unto the congregation be three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep ,
and thirty and six thousand beef ,
and thirty thousand ass and five hundred ,
and sixteen thousand person ; )
even of the child of israel 's half , moses take one portion of fifty , both of man and of beast , and give they unto the levites , which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord ; as the lord command moses .
and the officer which be over thousand of the host , the captain of thousand , and captain of hundred , come near unto mose :
and they say unto mose , thy servant have take the sum of the man of war which be under we charge , and there lacketh not one man of we .
we have therefore bring a oblation for the lord , what every man have get , of jewel of gold , chain , and bracelet , ring , earring , and tablet , to make a atonement for we soul before the lord .
and moses and eleazar the priest take the gold of they , even all work jewel .
and all the gold of the offering that they offer up to the lord , of the captain of thousand , and of the captain of hundred , be sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekel .
( for the man of war have take spoil , every man for himself . )
and moses and eleazar the priest take the gold of the captain of thousand and of hundred , and bring it into the tabernacle of the congregation , for a memorial for the child of israel before the lord .
now the child of reuben and the child of gad have a very great multitude of cattle : and when they see the land of jazer , and the land of gilead , that , behold , the place be a place for cattle ;
the child of gad and the child of reuben come and speak unto mose , and to eleazar the priest , and unto the prince of the congregation , say ,

even the country which the lord smite before the congregation of israel , be a land for cattle , and thy servant have cattle :
wherefore , say they , if we have find grace in thy sight , let this land be give unto thy servant for a possession , and bring we not over jordan .
and moses say unto the child of gad and to the child of reuben , shall you brethren go to war , and shall ye sit here ?
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the child of israel from go over into the land which the lord have give they ?
thus do you father , when i send they from kadeshbarnea to see the land .
for when they go up unto the valley of eshcol , and see the land , they discourage the heart of the child of israel , that they should not go into the land which the lord have give they .
and the lord 's anger be kindle the same time , and he sware , say ,
surely none of the man that come up out of egypt , from twenty year old and upward , shall see the land which i sware unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob ; because they have not wholly follow i :
save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite , and joshua the son of nun : for they have wholly follow the lord .
and the lord 's anger be kindle against israel , and he make they wander in the wilderness forty year , until all the generation , that have do evil in the sight of the lord , be consume .
and , behold , ye be rise up in you father ' stead , a increase of sinful man , to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel .
for if ye turn away from after he , he will yet again leave they in the wilderness ; and ye shall destroy all this people .
and they come near unto he , and say , we will build sheepfold here for we cattle , and city for we little one :
but we ourselves will go ready arm before the child of israel , until we have bring they unto they place : and we little one shall dwell in the fenced city because of the inhabitant of the land .
we will not return unto we house , until the child of israel have inherit every man he inheritance .
for we will not inherit with they on yonder side jordan , or forward ; because we inheritance be fall to we on this side jordan eastward .
and moses say unto they , if ye will do this thing , if ye will go armed before the lord to war ,
and will go all of you arm over jordan before the lord , until he have drive out he enemy from before he ,
and the land be subdue before the lord : then afterward ye shall return , and be guiltless before the lord , and before israel ; and this land shall be you possession before the lord .
but if ye will not do so , behold , ye have sin against the lord : and be sure you sin will find you out .
build you city for you little one , and fold for you sheep ; and do that which have proceed out of you mouth .
and the child of gad and the child of reuben spake unto moses , say , thy servant will do as my lord commandeth .
we little one , we wife , we flock , and all we cattle , shall be there in the city of gilead :
but thy servant will pass over , every man arm for war , before the lord to battle , as my lord saith .
so concern they moses command eleazar the priest , and joshua the son of nun , and the chief father of the tribe of the child of israel :
and moses say unto they , if the child of gad and the child of reuben will pass with you over jordan , every man arm to battle , before the lord , and the land shall be subdue before you ; then ye shall give they the land of gilead for a possession :
but if they will not pass over with you armed , they shall have possession among you in the land of canaan .
and the child of gad and the child of reuben answer , say , as the lord have say unto thy servant , so will we do .
we will pass over arm before the lord into the land of canaan , that the possession of we inheritance on this side jordan may be ours .
and moses give unto they , even to the child of gad , and to the child of reuben , and unto half the tribe of manasseh the son of joseph , the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites , and the kingdom of og king of bashan , the land , with the city thereof in the coast , even the city of the country round about .

and bethnimrah , and bethharan , fenced city : and fold for sheep .
and the child of reuben build heshbon , and elealeh , and kirjathaim ,
and nebo , and baalmeon , ( they name be change , ) and shibmah : and give other name unto the city which they build .
and the child of machir the son of manasseh go to gilead , and take it , and dispossess the amorite which be in it .
and moses give gilead unto machir the son of manasseh ; and he dwell therein .
and jair the son of manasseh go and take the small town thereof , and call they havothjair .
and nobah go and take kenath , and the village thereof , and call it nobah , after he own name .
these be the journey of the child of israel , which go forth out of the land of egypt with they army under the hand of moses and aaron .
and moses write they going out accord to they journey by the commandment of the lord : and these be they journey accord to they going out .
and they depart from rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the morrow after the passover the child of israel go out with a high hand in the sight of all the egyptians .
for the egyptians bury all they firstborn , which the lord have smite among they : upon they god also the lord execute judgment .
and the child of israel remove from rameses , and pitch in succoth .
and they depart from succoth , and pitch in etham , which be in the edge of the wilderness .

and they remove from eziongaber , and pitch in the wilderness of zin , which be kadesh .
and they remove from kadesh , and pitch in mount hor , in the edge of the land of edom .
and aaron the priest go up into mount hor at the commandment of the lord , and die there , in the fortieth year after the child of israel be come out of the land of egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
and aaron be a hundred and twenty and three year old when he die in mount hor .
and king arad the canaanite , which dwell in the south in the land of canaan , hear of the come of the child of israel .
and they depart from mount hor , and pitch in zalmonah .
and they depart from zalmonah , and pitch in punon .

and they remove from almondiblathaim , and pitch in the mountain of abarim , before nebo .
and they depart from the mountain of abarim , and pitch in the plain of moab by jordan near jericho .
and they pitch by jordan , from bethjesimoth even unto abelshittim in the plain of moab .
and the lord speak unto mose in the plain of moab by jordan near jericho , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye be pass over jordan into the land of canaan ;
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitant of the land from before you , and destroy all they picture , and destroy all they molten image , and quite pluck down all they high place :
and ye shall dispossess the inhabitant of the land , and dwell therein : for i have give you the land to possess it .
and ye shall divide the land by lot for a inheritance among you family : and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance , and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance : every man 's inheritance shall be in the place where he lot falleth ; accord to the tribe of you father ye shall inherit .
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitant of the land from before you ; then it shall come to pass , that those which ye let remain of they shall be prick in you eye , and thorn in you side , and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell .
moreover it shall come to pass , that i shall do unto you , as i think to do unto they .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
command the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye come into the land of canaan ; ( this be the land that shall fall unto you for a inheritance , even the land of canaan with the coast thereof : )
then you south quarter shall be from the wilderness of zin along by the coast of edom , and you south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward :
and you border shall turn from the south to the ascent of akrabbim , and pass on to zin : and the go forth thereof shall be from the south to kadeshbarnea , and shall go on to hazaraddar , and pass on to azmon :
and the border shall fetch a compass from azmon unto the river of egypt , and the going out of it shall be at the sea .
and as for the western border , ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be you west border .
and this shall be you north border : from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount hor :
from mount hor ye shall point out you border unto the entrance of hamath ; and the going forth of the border shall be to zedad :
and the border shall go on to ziphron , and the going out of it shall be at hazarenan : this shall be you north border .
and ye shall point out you east border from hazarenan to shepham :
and the coast shall go down from shepham to riblah , on the east side of ain ; and the border shall descend , and shall reach unto the side of the sea of chinnereth eastward :
and the border shall go down to jordan , and the going out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be you land with the coast thereof round about .
and moses command the child of israel , say , this be the land which ye shall inherit by lot , which the lord command to give unto the nine tribe , and to the half tribe :
for the tribe of the child of reuben accord to the house of they father , and the tribe of the child of gad accord to the house of they father , have receive they inheritance ; and half the tribe of manasseh have receive they inheritance :
the two tribe and the half tribe have receive they inheritance on this side jordan near jericho eastward , toward the sunrising .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
these be the name of the man which shall divide the land unto you : eleazar the priest , and joshua the son of nun .
and ye shall take one prince of every tribe , to divide the land by inheritance .
and the name of the man be these : of the tribe of judah , caleb the son of jephunneh .
and of the tribe of the child of simeon , shemuel the son of ammihud .
of the tribe of benjamin , elidad the son of chislon .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of dan , bukki the son of jogli .
the prince of the child of joseph , for the tribe of the child of manasseh , hanniel the son of ephod .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of ephraim , kemuel the son of shiphtan .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of zebulun , elizaphan the son of parnach .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of issachar , paltiel the son of azzan .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of asher , ahihud the son of shelomi .
and the prince of the tribe of the child of naphtali , pedahel the son of ammihud .
these be they whom the lord command to divide the inheritance unto the child of israel in the land of canaan .
and the lord speak unto mose in the plain of moab by jordan near jericho , say ,
command the child of israel , that they give unto the levites of the inheritance of they possession city to dwell in ; and ye shall give also unto the levites suburb for the city round about they .
and the city shall they have to dwell in ; and the suburb of they shall be for they cattle , and for they goods , and for all they beast .
and the suburb of the city , which ye shall give unto the levites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubit round about .
and ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubit , and on the south side two thousand cubit , and on the west side two thousand cubit , and on the north side two thousand cubit ; and the city shall be in the midst : this shall be to they the suburb of the city .
and among the city which ye shall give unto the levites there shall be six city for refuge , which ye shall appoint for the manslayer , that he may flee thither : and to they ye shall add forty and two city .
so all the city which ye shall give to the levites shall be forty and eight city : they shall ye give with they suburb .
and the city which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the child of israel : from they that have many ye shall give many ; but from they that have few ye shall give few : every one shall give of he city unto the levites accord to he inheritance which he inheriteth .
and the lord speak unto mose , say ,
speak unto the child of israel , and say unto they , when ye be come over jordan into the land of canaan ;
then ye shall appoint you city to be city of refuge for you ; that the slayer may flee thither , which killeth any person at unaware .
and they shall be unto you city for refuge from the avenger ; that the manslayer die not , until he stand before the congregation in judgment .
and of these city which ye shall give six city shall ye have for refuge .
ye shall give three city on this side jordan , and three city shall ye give in the land of canaan , which shall be city of refuge .
these six city shall be a refuge , both for the child of israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among they : that every one that killeth any person unaware may flee thither .
and if he smite he with a instrument of iron , so that he die , he be a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
and if he smite he with throw a stone , wherewith he may die , and he die , he be a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he smite he with a hand weapon of wood , wherewith he may die , and he die , he be a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer : when he meeteth he , he shall slay he .
but if he thrust he of hatred , or hurl at he by lay of wait , that he die ;
or in enmity smite he with he hand , that he die : he that smite he shall surely be put to death ; for he be a murderer : the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer , when he meeteth he .
but if he thrust he suddenly without enmity , or have cast upon he any thing without lay of wait ,
or with any stone , wherewith a man may die , see he not , and cast it upon he , that he die , and be not he enemy , neither seek he harm :
then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood accord to these judgment :
and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood , and the congregation shall restore he to the city of he refuge , whither he be flee : and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest , which be anoint with the holy oil .
but if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of he refuge , whither he be flee ;
and the revenger of blood find he without the border of the city of he refuge , and the revenger of blood kill the slayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood :
because he should have remain in the city of he refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of he possession .
so these thing shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout you generation in all you dwelling .
whoso killeth any person , the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witness : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause he to die .
moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer , which be guilty of death : but he shall be surely put to death .
and ye shall take no satisfaction for he that be flee to the city of he refuge , that he should come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye be : for blood it defileth the land : and the land can not be cleanse of the blood that be shed therein , but by the blood of he that shed it .
defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit , wherein i dwell : for i the lord dwell among the child of israel .
and the chief father of the family of the child of gilead , the son of machir , the son of manasseh , of the family of the son of joseph , come near , and spake before moses , and before the prince , the chief father of the child of israel :
and they say , the lord command my lord to give the land for a inheritance by lot to the child of israel : and my lord be command by the lord to give the inheritance of zelophehad we brother unto he daughter .
and if they be marry to any of the son of the other tribe of the child of israel , then shall they inheritance be take from the inheritance of we father , and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they be receive : so shall it be take from the lot of we inheritance .
and when the jubile of the child of israel shall be , then shall they inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they be receive : so shall they inheritance be take away from the inheritance of the tribe of we father .
and moses command the child of israel accord to the word of the lord , say , the tribe of the son of joseph have say well .
this be the thing which the lord doth command concern the daughter of zelophehad , say , let they marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of they father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the child of israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the child of israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of he father .
and every daughter , that possesseth a inheritance in any tribe of the child of israel , shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of she father , that the child of israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of he father .
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; but every one of the tribe of the child of israel shall keep himself to he own inheritance .
even as the lord command moses , so do the daughter of zelophehad :
for mahlah , tirzah , and hoglah , and milcah , and noah , the daughter of zelophehad , be marry unto they father 's brother ' son :
and they be marry into the family of the son of manasseh the son of joseph , and they inheritance remain in the tribe of the family of they father .
these be the commandment and the judgment , which the lord command by the hand of moses unto the child of israel in the plain of moab by jordan near jericho .
these be the word which moses spake unto all israel on this side jordan in the wilderness , in the plain over against the red sea , between paran , and tophel , and laban , and hazeroth , and dizahab .
( there be eleven day ' journey from horeb by the way of mount seir unto kadeshbarnea . )
and it come to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that moses spake unto the child of israel , accord unto all that the lord have give he in commandment unto they ;
after he have slay sihon the king of the amorites , which dwell in heshbon , and og the king of bashan , which dwell at astaroth in edrei :
on this side jordan , in the land of moab , begin moses to declare this law , say ,
the lord we god spake unto we in horeb , say , ye have dwell long enough in this mount :
turn you , and take you journey , and go to the mount of the amorites , and unto all the place nigh thereunto , in the plain , in the hill , and in the vale , and in the south , and by the sea side , to the land of the canaanites , and unto lebanon , unto the great river , the river euphrates .
behold , i have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto you father , abraham , isaac , and jacob , to give unto they and to they seed after they .
and i speak unto you at that time , say , i be not able to bear you myself alone :
the lord you god have multiply you , and , behold , ye be this day as the star of heaven for multitude .
( the lord god of you father make you a thousand time so many more as ye be , and bless you , as he have promise you ! )
how can i myself alone bear you cumbrance , and you burden , and you strife ?
take you wise man , and understanding , and know among you tribe , and i will make they ruler over you .
and ye answer i , and say , the thing which thou hast speak be good for we to do .
so i take the chief of you tribe , wise man , and know , and make they head over you , captain over thousand , and captain over hundred , and captain over fifty , and captain over ten , and officer among you tribe .
and i charge you judge at that time , say , hear the cause between you brethren , and judge righteously between every man and he brother , and the stranger that be with he .
ye shall not respect person in judgment ; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man ; for the judgment be god 's : and the cause that be too hard for you , bring it unto i , and i will hear it .
and i command you at that time all the thing which ye should do .
and when we depart from horeb , we go through all that great and terrible wilderness , which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the amorites , as the lord we god command we ; and we come to kadeshbarnea .
and i say unto you , ye be come unto the mountain of the amorites , which the lord we god doth give unto we .
behold , the lord thy god have set the land before thee : go up and possess it , as the lord god of thy father have say unto thee ; fear not , neither be discourage .
and ye come near unto i every one of you , and say , we will send man before we , and they shall search we out the land , and bring we word again by what way we must go up , and into what city we shall come .
and the say pleased i well : and i take twelve man of you , one of a tribe :
and they turn and go up into the mountain , and come unto the valley of eshcol , and search it out .
and they take of the fruit of the land in they hand , and bring it down unto we , and bring we word again , and say , it be a good land which the lord we god doth give we .
notwithstanding ye would not go up , but rebel against the commandment of the lord you god :
and ye murmur in you tent , and say , because the lord hate we , he have bring we forth out of the land of egypt , to deliver we into the hand of the amorites , to destroy we .
whither shall we go up ? we brethren have discourage we heart , say , the people be greater and taller than we ; the city be great and wall up to heaven ; and moreover we have see the son of the anakims there .
then i say unto you , dread not , neither be afraid of they .
the lord you god which goeth before you , he shall fight for you , accord to all that he do for you in egypt before you eye ;
and in the wilderness , where thou hast see how that the lord thy god bare thee , as a man doth bear he son , in all the way that ye go , until ye come into this place .
yet in this thing ye do not believe the lord you god ,
who go in the way before you , to search you out a place to pitch you tent in , in fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should go , and in a cloud by day .
and the lord hear the voice of you word , and be wroth , and sware , say ,
surely there shall not one of these man of this evil generation see that good land , which i sware to give unto you father ,
save caleb the son of jephunneh ; he shall see it , and to he will i give the land that he have trodden upon , and to he child , because he have wholly follow the lord .
also the lord be angry with i for you sake , say , thou also shalt not go in thither .
but joshua the son of nun , which standeth before thee , he shall go in thither : encourage he : for he shall cause israel to inherit it .
moreover you little one , which ye say should be a prey , and you child , which in that day have no knowledge between good and evil , they shall go in thither , and unto they will i give it , and they shall possess it .
but as for you , turn you , and take you journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea .
then ye answer and say unto i , we have sin against the lord , we will go up and fight , accord to all that the lord we god command we .
and when ye have gird on every man he weapon of war , ye be ready to go up into the hill .
and the lord say unto i , say unto they , go not up , neither fight ; for i be not among you ; lest ye be smite before you enemy .
so i speak unto you ; and ye would not hear , but rebel against the commandment of the lord , and go presumptuously up into the hill .
and the amorites , which dwell in that mountain , come out against you , and chase you , as bee do , and destroy you in seir , even unto hormah .
and ye return and weep before the lord ; but the lord would not hearken to you voice , nor give ear unto you .
so ye abode in kadesh many day , accord unto the day that ye abode there .
then we turn , and take we journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea , as the lord speak unto i : and we compass mount seir many day .
and the lord speak unto i , say ,
ye have compass this mountain long enough : turn you northward .
and command thou the people , say , ye be to pass through the coast of you brethren the child of esau , which dwell in seir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed unto yourselve therefore :
meddle not with they ; for i will not give you of they land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because i have give mount seir unto esau for a possession .
ye shall buy meat of they for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of they for money , that ye may drink .
for the lord thy god have bless thee in all the work of thy hand : he knoweth thy walk through this great wilderness : these forty year the lord thy god have be with thee ; thou hast lack nothing .
and when we pass by from we brethren the child of esau , which dwell in seir , through the way of the plain from elath , and from eziongaber , we turn and pass by the way of the wilderness of moab .
and the lord say unto i , distress not the moabites , neither contend with they in battle : for i will not give thee of they land for a possession ; because i have give ar unto the child of lot for a possession .
the emims dwelt therein in time past , a people great , and many , and tall , as the anakims ;
which also be account giant , as the anakims ; but the moabites call they emims .
the horim also dwell in seir beforetime ; but the child of esau succeed they , when they have destroy they from before they , and dwelt in they stead ; as israel do unto the land of he possession , which the lord give unto they .
now rise up , say i , and get you over the brook zered .
and we go over the brook zered .
and the space in which we come from kadeshbarnea , until we be come over the brook zered , be thirty and eight year ; until all the generation of the man of war be waste out from among the host , as the lord sware unto they .
for indeed the hand of the lord be against they , to destroy they from among the host , until they be consume .
so it come to pass , when all the man of war be consume and dead from among the people ,
that the lord speak unto i , say ,
thou art to pass over through ar , the coast of moab , this day :
and when thou comest nigh over against the child of ammon , distress they not , nor meddle with they : for i will not give thee of the land of the child of ammon any possession ; because i have give it unto the child of lot for a possession .
( that also be account a land of giant : giant dwell therein in old time ; and the ammonites call they zamzummims ;
a people great , and many , and tall , as the anakims ; but the lord destroy they before they ; and they succeed they , and dwelt in they stead :
as he do to the child of esau , which dwell in seir , when he destroy the horims from before they ; and they succeed they , and dwelt in they stead even unto this day :
and the avim which dwell in hazerim , even unto azzah , the caphtorims , which come forth out of caphtor , destroy they , and dwelt in they stead . )
rise ye up , take you journey , and pass over the river arnon : behold , i have give into thine hand sihon the amorite , king of heshbon , and he land : begin to possess it , and contend with he in battle .
this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nation that be under the whole heaven , who shall hear report of thee , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of thee .
and i send messenger out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with word of peace , say ,
let i pass through thy land : i will go along by the high way , i will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left .
thou shalt sell i meat for money , that i may eat ; and give i water for money , that i may drink : only i will pass through on my foot ;
( as the child of esau which dwell in seir , and the moabite which dwell in ar , do unto i ; ) until i shall pass over jordan into the land which the lord we god giveth we .
but sihon king of heshbon would not let we pass by he : for the lord thy god harden he spirit , and make he heart obstinate , that he might deliver he into thy hand , as appeareth this day .
and the lord say unto i , behold , i have begin to give sihon and he land before thee : begin to possess , that thou mayest inherit he land .
then sihon come out against we , he and all he people , to fight at jahaz .
and the lord we god deliver he before we ; and we smite he , and he son , and all he people .
and we take all he city at that time , and utterly destroy the man , and the woman , and the little one , of every city , we leave none to remain :
only the cattle we take for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the city which we take .
from aroer , which be by the brink of the river of arnon , and from the city that be by the river , even unto gilead , there be not one city too strong for we : the lord we god deliver all unto we :
only unto the land of the child of ammon thou camest not , nor unto any place of the river jabbok , nor unto the city in the mountain , nor unto whatsoever the lord we god forbid we .
then we turn , and go up the way to bashan : and og the king of bashan come out against we , he and all he people , to battle at edrei .
and the lord say unto i , fear he not : for i will deliver he , and all he people , and he land , into thy hand ; and thou shalt do unto he as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites , which dwell at heshbon .
so the lord we god deliver into we hand og also , the king of bashan , and all he people : and we smite he until none be leave to he remain .
and we take all he city at that time , there be not a city which we take not from they , threescore city , all the region of argob , the kingdom of og in bashan .
all these city be fence with high wall , gate , and bar ; beside unwalled town a great many .
and we utterly destroy they , as we do unto sihon king of heshbon , utterly destroy the man , woman , and child , of every city .
but all the cattle , and the spoil of the city , we take for a prey to ourselves .
and we take at that time out of the hand of the two king of the amorites the land that be on this side jordan , from the river of arnon unto mount hermon ;
( which hermon the sidonians call sirion ; and the amorites call it shenir ; )
all the city of the plain , and all gilead , and all bashan , unto salchah and edrei , city of the kingdom of og in bashan .
for only og king of bashan remain of the remnant of giant ; behold , he bedstead be a bedstead of iron ; be it not in rabbath of the child of ammon ? nine cubit be the length thereof , and four cubit the breadth of it , after the cubit of a man .
and this land , which we possess at that time , from aroer , which be by the river arnon , and half mount gilead , and the city thereof , give i unto the reubenites and to the gadites .
and the rest of gilead , and all bashan , be the kingdom of og , give i unto the half tribe of manasseh ; all the region of argob , with all bashan , which be call the land of giant .
jair the son of manasseh take all the country of argob unto the coast of geshuri and maachathi ; and call they after he own name , bashanhavothjair , unto this day .
and i give gilead unto machir .
and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i give from gilead even unto the river arnon half the valley , and the border even unto the river jabbok , which be the border of the child of ammon ;
the plain also , and jordan , and the coast thereof , from chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , under ashdothpisgah eastward .
and i command you at that time , say , the lord you god have give you this land to possess it : ye shall pass over arm before you brethren the child of israel , all that be meet for the war .
but you wife , and you little one , and you cattle , ( for i know that ye have much cattle , ) shall abide in you city which i have give you ;
until the lord have give rest unto you brethren , as well as unto you , and until they also possess the land which the lord you god have give they beyond jordan : and then shall ye return every man unto he possession , which i have give you .
and i command joshua at that time , say , thine eye have see all that the lord you god have do unto these two king : so shall the lord do unto all the kingdom whither thou passest .
ye shall not fear they : for the lord you god he shall fight for you .
and i beseech the lord at that time , say ,
o lord god , thou hast begin to shew thy servant thy greatness , and thy mighty hand : for what god be there in heaven or in earth , that can do accord to thy work , and accord to thy might ?
i pray thee , let i go over , and see the good land that be beyond jordan , that goodly mountain , and lebanon .
but the lord be wroth with i for you sake , and would not hear i : and the lord say unto i , let it suffice thee ; speak no more unto i of this matter .
get thee up into the top of pisgah , and lift up thine eye westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and behold it with thine eye : for thou shalt not go over this jordan .
but charge joshua , and encourage he , and strengthen he : for he shall go over before this people , and he shall cause they to inherit the land which thou shalt see .
so we abide in the valley over against bethpeor .
now therefore hearken , o israel , unto the statute and unto the judgment , which i teach you , for to do they , that ye may live , and go in and possess the land which the lord god of you father giveth you .
ye shall not add unto the word which i command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandment of the lord you god which i command you .
you eye have see what the lord do because of baalpeor : for all the man that follow baalpeor , the lord thy god have destroy they from among you .
but ye that do cleave unto the lord you god be alive every one of you this day .
behold , i have teach you statute and judgment , even as the lord my god command i , that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it .
keep therefore and do they ; for this be you wisdom and you understanding in the sight of the nation , which shall hear all these statute , and say , surely this great nation be a wise and understand people .
for what nation be there so great , who have god so nigh unto they , as the lord we god be in all thing that we call upon he for ?
and what nation be there so great , that have statute and judgment so righteous as all this law , which i set before you this day ?
only take heed to thyself , and keep thy soul diligently , lest thou forget the thing which thine eye have see , and lest they depart from thy heart all the day of thy life : but teach they thy son , and thy son ' son ;
specially the day that thou stoodest before the lord thy god in horeb , when the lord say unto i , gather i the people together , and i will make they hear my word , that they may learn to fear i all the day that they shall live upon the earth , and that they may teach they child .
and ye come near and stand under the mountain ; and the mountain burn with fire unto the midst of heaven , with darkness , cloud , and thick darkness .
and the lord speak unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye hear the voice of the word , but see no similitude ; only ye hear a voice .
and he declare unto you he covenant , which he command you to perform , even ten commandment ; and he write they upon two table of stone .
and the lord command i at that time to teach you statute and judgment , that ye might do they in the land whither ye go over to possess it .
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselve ; for ye see no manner of similitude on the day that the lord speak unto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire :
lest ye corrupt yourselve , and make you a graven image , the similitude of any figure , the likeness of male or female ,
the likeness of any beast that be on the earth , the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air ,
the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground , the likeness of any fish that be in the water beneath the earth :
and lest thou lift up thine eye unto heaven , and when thou seest the sun , and the moon , and the star , even all the host of heaven , shouldest be drive to worship they , and serve they , which the lord thy god have divide unto all nation under the whole heaven .
but the lord have take you , and bring you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of egypt , to be unto he a people of inheritance , as ye be this day .
furthermore the lord be angry with i for you sake , and sware that i should not go over jordan , and that i should not go in unto that good land , which the lord thy god giveth thee for a inheritance :
but i must die in this land , i must not go over jordan : but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
take heed unto yourselve , lest ye forget the covenant of the lord you god , which he make with you , and make you a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , which the lord thy god have forbid thee .
for the lord thy god be a consuming fire , even a jealous god .
when thou shalt beget child , and child 's child , and ye shall have remain long in the land , and shall corrupt yourselve , and make a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , and shall do evil in the sight of the lord thy god , to provoke he to anger :
i call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan to possess it ; ye shall not prolong you day upon it , but shall utterly be destroy .
and the lord shall scatter you among the nation , and ye shall be leave few in number among the heathen , whither the lord shall lead you .
and there ye shall serve god , the work of man 's hand , wood and stone , which neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor smell .
but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god , thou shalt find he , if thou seek he with all thy heart and with all thy soul .
when thou art in tribulation , and all these thing be come upon thee , even in the latter day , if thou turn to the lord thy god , and shalt be obedient unto he voice ;
( for the lord thy god be a merciful god ; ) he will not forsake thee , neither destroy thee , nor forget the covenant of thy father which he sware unto they .
for ask now of the day that be past , which be before thee , since the day that god create man upon the earth , and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other , whether there have be any such thing as this great thing be , or have be hear like it ?
do ever people hear the voice of god speak out of the midst of the fire , as thou hast hear , and live ?
or have god assay to go and take he a nation from the midst of another nation , by temptation , by sign , and by wonder , and by war , and by a mighty hand , and by a stretch out arm , and by great terror , accord to all that the lord you god do for you in egypt before you eye ?
unto thee it be shew , that thou mightest know that the lord he be god ; there be none else beside he .
out of heaven he make thee to hear he voice , that he might instruct thee : and upon earth he shew thee he great fire ; and thou heardest he word out of the midst of the fire .
and because he love thy father , therefore he choose they seed after they , and bring thee out in he sight with he mighty power out of egypt ;
to drive out nation from before thee greater and mightier than thou art , to bring thee in , to give thee they land for a inheritance , as it be this day .
know therefore this day , and consider it in thine heart , that the lord he be god in heaven above , and upon the earth beneath : there be none else .
thou shalt keep therefore he statute , and he commandment , which i command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with thy child after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy day upon the earth , which the lord thy god giveth thee , for ever .
then moses sever three city on this side jordan toward the sunrising ;
that the slayer might flee thither , which should kill he neighbour unaware , and hate he not in time past ; and that flee unto one of these city he might live :
namely , bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , of the reubenites ; and ramoth in gilead , of the gadites ; and golan in bashan , of the manassites .
and this be the law which moses set before the child of israel :
these be the testimony , and the statute , and the judgment , which moses spake unto the child of israel , after they come forth out of egypt ,
on this side jordan , in the valley over against bethpeor , in the land of sihon king of the amorites , who dwell at heshbon , whom mose and the child of israel smite , after they be come forth out of egypt :
and they possess he land , and the land of og king of bashan , two king of the amorites , which be on this side jordan toward the sunrising ;
from aroer , which be by the bank of the river arnon , even unto mount sion , which be hermon ,
and all the plain on this side jordan eastward , even unto the sea of the plain , under the spring of pisgah .
and moses call all israel , and say unto they , hear , o israel , the statute and judgment which i speak in you ear this day , that ye may learn they , and keep , and do they .
the lord we god make a covenant with we in horeb .
the lord make not this covenant with we father , but with we , even we , who be all of we here alive this day .
the lord talk with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire ,
( i stand between the lord and you at that time , to shew you the word of the lord : for ye be afraid by reason of the fire , and go not up into the mount ; ) say ,
i be the lord thy god , which bring thee out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage .
thou shalt have none other god before i .
thou shalt not make thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that be in heaven above , or that be in the earth beneath , or that be in the water beneath the earth :
thou shalt not bow down thyself unto they , nor serve they : for i the lord thy god be a jealous god , visit the iniquity of the father upon the child unto the third and fourth generation of they that hate i ,
and shew mercy unto thousand of they that love i and keep my commandment .
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain : for the lord will not hold he guiltless that taketh he name in vain .
keep the sabbath day to sanctify it , as the lord thy god have command thee .
six day thou shalt labour , and do all thy work :
but the seventh day be the sabbath of the lord thy god : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , nor thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thine ox , nor thine ass , nor any of thy cattle , nor thy stranger that be within thy gate ; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou .
and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt , and that the lord thy god bring thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretch out arm : therefore the lord thy god command thee to keep the sabbath day .
honour thy father and thy mother , as the lord thy god have command thee ; that thy day may be prolong , and that it may go well with thee , in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
thou shalt not kill .
neither shalt thou commit adultery .
neither shalt thou steal .
neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour .
neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour 's wife , neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour 's house , he field , or he manservant , or he maidservant , he ox , or he ass , or any thing that be thy neighbour 's .
these word the lord spake unto all you assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thick darkness , with a great voice : and he add no more .
and he write they in two table of stone , and deliver they unto i .
and it come to pass , when ye hear the voice out of the midst of the darkness , ( for the mountain do burn with fire , ) that ye come near unto i , even all the head of you tribe , and you elder ;
and ye say , behold , the lord we god have shewed we he glory and he greatness , and we have hear he voice out of the midst of the fire : we have see this day that god doth talk with man , and he liveth .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume we : if we hear the voice of the lord we god any more , then we shall die .
for who be there of all flesh , that have hear the voice of the living god speak out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and live ?
go thou near , and hear all that the lord we god shall say : and speak thou unto we all that the lord we god shall speak unto thee ; and we will hear it , and do it .
and the lord hear the voice of you word , when ye spake unto i ; and the lord say unto i , i have hear the voice of the word of this people , which they have speak unto thee : they have well say all that they have speak .
o that there be such a heart in they , that they would fear i , and keep all my commandment always , that it might be well with they , and with they child for ever !
go say to they , get you into you tent again .
but as for thee , stand thou here by i , and i will speak unto thee all the commandment , and the statute , and the judgment , which thou shalt teach they , that they may do they in the land which i give they to possess it .
ye shall observe to do therefore as the lord you god have command you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
ye shall walk in all the way which the lord you god have command you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prolong you day in the land which ye shall possess .
now these be the commandment , the statute , and the judgment , which the lord you god command to teach you , that ye might do they in the land whither ye go to possess it :
that thou mightest fear the lord thy god , to keep all he statute and he commandment , which i command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son 's son , all the day of thy life ; and that thy day may be prolong .
hear therefore , o israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with thee , and that ye may increase mightily , as the lord god of thy father have promise thee , in the land that floweth with milk and honey .
hear , o israel : the lord we god be one lord :
and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might .
and these word , which i command thee this day , shall be in thine heart :
and thou shalt teach they diligently unto thy child , and shalt talk of they when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , and when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
and thou shalt bind they for a sign upon thine hand , and they shall be as frontlet between thine eye .
and thou shalt write they upon the post of thy house , and on thy gate .
and it shall be , when the lord thy god shall have bring thee into the land which he sware unto thy father , to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob , to give thee great and goodly city , which thou buildedst not ,
and house full of all good thing , which thou filledst not , and well dig , which thou diggedst not , vineyard and olive tree , which thou plantedst not ; when thou shalt have eat and be full ;
then beware lest thou forget the lord , which bring thee forth out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage .
thou shalt fear the lord thy god , and serve he , and shalt swear by he name .
ye shall not go after other god , of the god of the people which be round about you ;
( for the lord thy god be a jealous god among you ) lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindle against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
ye shall not tempt the lord you god , as ye tempt he in massah .
ye shall diligently keep the commandment of the lord you god , and he testimony , and he statute , which he have command thee .
and thou shalt do that which be right and good in the sight of the lord : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the lord sware unto thy father ,
to cast out all thine enemy from before thee , as the lord have speak .
and when thy son asketh thee in time to come , say , what mean the testimony , and the statute , and the judgment , which the lord we god have command you ?
then thou shalt say unto thy son , we be pharaoh 's bondman in egypt ; and the lord bring we out of egypt with a mighty hand :
and the lord shew sign and wonder , great and sore , upon egypt , upon pharaoh , and upon all he household , before we eye :
and he bring we out from thence , that he might bring we in , to give we the land which he sware unto we father .
and the lord command we to do all these statute , to fear the lord we god , for we good always , that he might preserve we alive , as it be at this day .
and it shall be we righteousness , if we observe to do all these commandment before the lord we god , as he have command we .
when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it , and have cast out many nation before thee , the hittites , and the girgashites , and the amorites , and the canaanites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , seven nation greater and mightier than thou ;
and when the lord thy god shall deliver they before thee ; thou shalt smite they , and utterly destroy they ; thou shalt make no covenant with they , nor shew mercy unto they :
neither shalt thou make marriage with they ; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto he son , nor he daughter shalt thou take unto thy son .
for they will turn away thy son from follow i , that they may serve other god : so will the anger of the lord be kindle against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
but thus shall ye deal with they ; ye shall destroy they altar , and break down they image , and cut down they grove , and burn they graven image with fire .
for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god : the lord thy god have choose thee to be a special people unto himself , above all people that be upon the face of the earth .
the lord do not set he love upon you , nor choose you , because ye be more in number than any people ; for ye be the fewest of all people :
but because the lord love you , and because he would keep the oath which he have swear unto you father , have the lord bring you out with a mighty hand , and redeem you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt .
know therefore that the lord thy god , he be god , the faithful god , which keepeth covenant and mercy with they that love he and keep he commandment to a thousand generation ;
and repayeth they that hate he to they face , to destroy they : he will not be slack to he that hateth he , he will repay he to he face .
thou shalt therefore keep the commandment , and the statute , and the judgment , which i command thee this day , to do they .
wherefore it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these judgment , and keep , and do they , that the lord thy god shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy father :
and he will love thee , and bless thee , and multiply thee : he will also bless the fruit of thy womb , and the fruit of thy land , thy corn , and thy wine , and thine oil , the increase of thy kine , and the flock of thy sheep , in the land which he sware unto thy father to give thee .
thou shalt be bless above all people : there shall not be male or female barren among you , or among you cattle .
and the lord will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil disease of egypt , which thou knowest , upon thee ; but will lay they upon all they that hate thee .
and thou shalt consume all the people which the lord thy god shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon they : neither shalt thou serve they god ; for that will be a snare unto thee .
if thou shalt say in thine heart , these nation be more than i ; how can i dispossess they ?
thou shalt not be afraid of they : but shalt well remember what the lord thy god do unto pharaoh , and unto all egypt ;
the great temptation which thine eye see , and the sign , and the wonder , and the mighty hand , and the stretch out arm , whereby the lord thy god bring thee out : so shall the lord thy god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid .
moreover the lord thy god will send the hornet among they , until they that be leave , and hide themselves from thee , be destroy .
thou shalt not be affright at they : for the lord thy god be among you , a mighty god and terrible .
and the lord thy god will put out those nation before thee by little and little : thou mayest not consume they at once , lest the beast of the field increase upon thee .
but the lord thy god shall deliver they unto thee , and shall destroy they with a mighty destruction , until they be destroy .
and he shall deliver they king into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy they name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroy they .
the graven image of they god shall ye burn with fire : thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that be on they , nor take it unto thee , lest thou be snare therein : for it be a abomination to the lord thy god .
neither shalt thou bring a abomination into thine house , lest thou be a cursed thing like it : but thou shalt utterly detest it , and thou shalt utterly abhor it ; for it be a cursed thing .
all the commandment which i command thee this day shall ye observe to do , that ye may live , and multiply , and go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto you father .
and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god lead thee these forty year in the wilderness , to humble thee , and to prove thee , to know what be in thine heart , whether thou wouldest keep he commandment , or no. .
and he humble thee , and suffer thee to hunger , and feed thee with manna , which thou knewest not , neither do thy father know ; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live .
thy raiment wax not old upon thee , neither do thy foot swell , these forty year .
thou shalt also consider in thine heart , that , as a man chasteneth he son , so the lord thy god chasteneth thee .
therefore thou shalt keep the commandment of the lord thy god , to walk in he way , and to fear he .
for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good land , a land of brook of water , of fountain and depths that spring out of valley and hill ;
a land of wheat , and barley , and vine , and fig tree , and pomegranate ; a land of oil olive , and honey ;
a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness , thou shalt not lack any thing in it ; a land whose stone be iron , and out of whose hill thou mayest dig brass .
when thou hast eat and art full , then thou shalt bless the lord thy god for the good land which he have give thee .
beware that thou forget not the lord thy god , in not keep he commandment , and he judgment , and he statute , which i command thee this day :
lest when thou hast eat and art full , and hast build goodly house , and dwelt therein ;
and when thy herd and thy flock multiply , and thy silver and thy gold be multiply , and all that thou hast be multiply ;
then thine heart be lift up , and thou forget the lord thy god , which bring thee forth out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage ;
who lead thee through that great and terrible wilderness , wherein be fiery serpent , and scorpion , and drought , where there be no water ; who bring thee forth water out of the rock of flint ;
who feed thee in the wilderness with manna , which thy father know not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
and thou say in thine heart , my power and the might of mine hand have get i this wealth .
but thou shalt remember the lord thy god : for it be he that giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish he covenant which he sware unto thy father , as it be this day .
and it shall be , if thou do at all forget the lord thy god , and walk after other god , and serve they , and worship they , i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish .
as the nation which the lord destroyeth before you face , so shall ye perish ; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the lord you god .
hear , o israel : thou art to pass over jordan this day , to go in to possess nation greater and mightier than thyself , city great and fence up to heaven ,
a people great and tall , the child of the anakims , whom thou knowest , and of whom thou hast hear say , who can stand before the child of anak !
understand therefore this day , that the lord thy god be he which goeth over before thee ; as a consuming fire he shall destroy they , and he shall bring they down before thy face : so shalt thou drive they out , and destroy they quickly , as the lord have say unto thee .
speak not thou in thine heart , after that the lord thy god have cast they out from before thee , say , for my righteousness the lord have bring i in to possess this land : but for the wickedness of these nation the lord doth drive they out from before thee .
not for thy righteousness , or for the uprightness of thine heart , dost thou go to possess they land : but for the wickedness of these nation the lord thy god doth drive they out from before thee , and that he may perform the word which the lord sware unto thy father , abraham , isaac , and jacob .
understand therefore , that the lord thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness ; for thou art a stiffnecked people .
remember , and forget not , how thou provokedst the lord thy god to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of egypt , until ye come unto this place , ye have be rebellious against the lord .
also in horeb ye provoke the lord to wrath , so that the lord be angry with you to have destroy you .
when i be go up into the mount to receive the table of stone , even the table of the covenant which the lord make with you , then i abide in the mount forty day and forty night , i neither do eat bread nor drink water :
and the lord deliver unto i two table of stone write with the finger of god ; and on they be write accord to all the word , which the lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
and it come to pass at the end of forty day and forty night , that the lord give i the two table of stone , even the table of the covenant .
and the lord say unto i , arise , get thee down quickly from hence ; for thy people which thou hast bring forth out of egypt have corrupt themselves ; they be quickly turn aside out of the way which i command they ; they have make they a molten image .
furthermore the lord speak unto i , say , i have see this people , and , behold , it be a stiffnecked people :
let i alone , that i may destroy they , and blot out they name from under heaven : and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they .
so i turn and come down from the mount , and the mount burn with fire : and the two table of the covenant be in my two hand .
and i look , and , behold , ye have sin against the lord you god , and have make you a molten calf : ye have turn aside quickly out of the way which the lord have command you .
and i take the two table , and cast they out of my two hand , and brake they before you eye .
and i fall down before the lord , as at the first , forty day and forty night : i do neither eat bread , nor drink water , because of all you sin which ye sin , in do wickedly in the sight of the lord , to provoke he to anger .
for i be afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , wherewith the lord be wroth against you to destroy you .
but the lord hearken unto i at that time also .
and the lord be very angry with aaron to have destroy he : and i pray for aaron also the same time .
and i take you sin , the calf which ye have make , and burn it with fire , and stamp it , and ground it very small , even until it be as small as dust : and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descend out of the mount .
and at taberah , and at massah , and at kibrothhattaavah , ye provoke the lord to wrath .
likewise when the lord send you from kadeshbarnea , say , go up and possess the land which i have give you ; then ye rebel against the commandment of the lord you god , and ye believe he not , nor hearken to he voice .
ye have be rebellious against the lord from the day that i know you .
thus i fall down before the lord forty day and forty night , as i fall down at the first ; because the lord have say he would destroy you .
i pray therefore unto the lord , and say , o lord god , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeem through thy greatness , which thou hast bring forth out of egypt with a mighty hand .
remember thy servant , abraham , isaac , and jacob ; look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to they wickedness , nor to they sin :
lest the land whence thou broughtest we out say , because the lord be not able to bring they into the land which he promise they , and because he hate they , he have bring they out to slay they in the wilderness .
yet they be thy people and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretch out arm .
at that time the lord say unto i , hew thee two table of stone like unto the first , and come up unto i into the mount , and make thee a ark of wood .
and i will write on the table the word that be in the first table which thou brakest , and thou shalt put they in the ark .
and i make a ark of shittim wood , and hew two table of stone like unto the first , and go up into the mount , have the two table in mine hand .
and he write on the table , accord to the first writing , the ten commandment , which the lord speak unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the lord give they unto i .
and i turn myself and come down from the mount , and put the table in the ark which i have make ; and there they be , as the lord command i .
and the child of israel take they journey from beeroth of the child of jaakan to mosera : there aaron die , and there he be bury ; and eleazar he son minister in the priest 's office in he stead .
from thence they journey unto gudgodah ; and from gudgodah to jotbath , a land of river of water .
at that time the lord separate the tribe of levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord , to stand before the lord to minister unto he , and to bless in he name , unto this day .
wherefore levi have no part nor inheritance with he brethren ; the lord be he inheritance , accord as the lord thy god promise he .
and i stay in the mount , accord to the first time , forty day and forty night ; and the lord hearken unto i at that time also , and the lord would not destroy thee .
and the lord say unto i , arise , take thy journey before the people , that they may go in and possess the land , which i sware unto they father to give unto they .
and now , israel , what doth the lord thy god require of thee , but to fear the lord thy god , to walk in all he way , and to love he , and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul ,
to keep the commandment of the lord , and he statute , which i command thee this day for thy good ?
behold , the heaven and the heaven of heaven be the lord 's thy god , the earth also , with all that therein be .
only the lord have a delight in thy father to love they , and he choose they seed after they , even you above all people , as it be this day .
circumcise therefore the foreskin of you heart , and be no more stiffnecked .
for the lord you god be god of god , and lord of lord , a great god , a mighty , and a terrible , which regardeth not person , nor taketh reward :
he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow , and loveth the stranger , in give he food and raiment .
love ye therefore the stranger : for ye be stranger in the land of egypt .
thou shalt fear the lord thy god ; he shalt thou serve , and to he shalt thou cleave , and swear by he name .
he be thy praise , and he be thy god , that have do for thee these great and terrible thing , which thine eye have see .
thy father go down into egypt with threescore and ten person ; and now the lord thy god have make thee as the star of heaven for multitude .
therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god , and keep he charge , and he statute , and he judgment , and he commandment , alway .
and know ye this day : for i speak not with you child which have not know , and which have not see the chastisement of the lord you god , he greatness , he mighty hand , and he stretch out arm ,
and he miracle , and he act , which he do in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt , and unto all he land ;
and what he do unto the army of egypt , unto they horse , and to they chariot ; how he make the water of the red sea to overflow they as they pursue after you , and how the lord have destroy they unto this day ;
and what he do unto you in the wilderness , until ye come into this place ;
and what he do unto dathan and abiram , the son of eliab , the son of reuben : how the earth open she mouth , and swallow they up , and they household , and they tent , and all the substance that be in they possession , in the midst of all israel :
but you eye have see all the great act of the lord which he do .
therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which i command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land , whither ye go to possess it ;
and that ye may prolong you day in the land , which the lord sware unto you father to give unto they and to they seed , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
for the land , whither thou goest in to possess it , be not as the land of egypt , from whence ye come out , where thou sowedst thy seed , and wateredst it with thy foot , as a garden of herb :
but the land , whither ye go to possess it , be a land of hill and valley , and drinketh water of the rain of heaven :
a land which the lord thy god careth for : the eye of the lord thy god be always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandment which i command you this day , to love the lord you god , and to serve he with all you heart and with all you soul ,
that i will give you the rain of you land in he due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that thou mayest gather in thy corn , and thy wine , and thine oil .
and i will send grass in thy field for thy cattle , that thou mayest eat and be full .
take heed to yourselve , that you heart be not deceive , and ye turn aside , and serve other god , and worship they ;
and then the lord 's wrath be kindle against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not she fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you .
therefore shall ye lay up these my word in you heart and in you soul , and bind they for a sign upon you hand , that they may be as frontlet between you eye .
and ye shall teach they you child , speaking of they when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
and thou shalt write they upon the door post of thine house , and upon thy gate :
that you day may be multiply , and the day of you child , in the land which the lord sware unto you father to give they , as the day of heaven upon the earth .
for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandment which i command you , to do they , to love the lord you god , to walk in all he way , and to cleave unto he ;
then will the lord drive out all these nation from before you , and ye shall possess greater nation and mightier than yourselve .
every place whereon the sole of you foot shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness and lebanon , from the river , the river euphrates , even unto the uttermost sea shall you coast be .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the lord you god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he have say unto you .
behold , i set before you this day a blessing and a curse ;
a blessing , if ye obey the commandment of the lord you god , which i command you this day :
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandment of the lord you god , but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day , to go after other god , which ye have not know .
and it shall come to pass , when the lord thy god have bring thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount gerizim , and the curse upon mount ebal .
be they not on the other side jordan , by the way where the sun goeth down , in the land of the canaanites , which dwell in the champaign over against gilgal , beside the plain of moreh ?
for ye shall pass over jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord you god giveth you , and ye shall possess it , and dwell therein .
and ye shall observe to do all the statute and judgment which i set before you this day .
these be the statute and judgment , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the lord god of thy father giveth thee to possess it , all the day that ye live upon the earth .
ye shall utterly destroy all the place , wherein the nation which ye shall possess serve they god , upon the high mountain , and upon the hill , and under every green tree :
and ye shall overthrow they altar , and break they pillar , and burn they grove with fire ; and ye shall hew down the graven image of they god , and destroy the name of they out of that place .
ye shall not do so unto the lord you god .
but unto the place which the lord you god shall choose out of all you tribe to put he name there , even unto he habitation shall ye seek , and thither thou shalt come :
and thither ye shall bring you burnt offering , and you sacrifice , and you tithe , and heave offering of you hand , and you vow , and you freewill offering , and the firstling of you herd and of you flock :
and there ye shall eat before the lord you god , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put you hand unto , ye and you household , wherein the lord thy god have bless thee .
ye shall not do after all the thing that we do here this day , every man whatsoever be right in he own eye .
for ye be not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance , which the lord you god giveth you .
but when ye go over jordan , and dwell in the land which the lord you god giveth you to inherit , and when he giveth you rest from all you enemy round about , so that ye dwell in safety ;
then there shall be a place which the lord you god shall choose to cause he name to dwell there ; thither shall ye bring all that i command you ; you burnt offering , and you sacrifice , you tithe , and the heave offering of you hand , and all you choice vow which ye vow unto the lord :
and ye shall rejoice before the lord you god , ye , and you son , and you daughter , and you manservant , and you maidservant , and the levite that be within you gate ; forasmuch as he have no part nor inheritance with you .
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offering in every place that thou seest :
but in the place which the lord shall choose in one of thy tribe , there thou shalt offer thy burnt offering , and there thou shalt do all that i command thee .
notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gate , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after , accord to the blessing of the lord thy god which he have give thee : the unclean and the clean may eat thereof , as of the roebuck , and as of the hart .
only ye shall not eat the blood ; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water .
thou mayest not eat within thy gate the tithe of thy corn , or of thy wine , or of thy oil , or the firstling of thy herd or of thy flock , nor any of thy vow which thou vowest , nor thy freewill offering , or heave offering of thine hand :
but thou must eat they before the lord thy god in the place which the lord thy god shall choose , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the levite that be within thy gate : and thou shalt rejoice before the lord thy god in all that thou puttest thine hand unto .
take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as thou livest upon the earth .
when the lord thy god shall enlarge thy border , as he have promise thee , and thou shalt say , i will eat flesh , because thy soul longeth to eat flesh ; thou mayest eat flesh , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after .
if the place which the lord thy god have choose to put he name there be too far from thee , then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock , which the lord have give thee , as i have command thee , and thou shalt eat in thy gate whatsoever thy soul lusteth after .
even as the roebuck and the hart be eat , so thou shalt eat they : the unclean and the clean shall eat of they alike .
only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood be the life ; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh .
thou shalt not eat it ; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water .
thou shalt not eat it ; that it may go well with thee , and with thy child after thee , when thou shalt do that which be right in the sight of the lord .
only thy holy thing which thou hast , and thy vow , thou shalt take , and go unto the place which the lord shall choose :
and thou shalt offer thy burnt offering , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the lord thy god : and the blood of thy sacrifice shall be pour out upon the altar of the lord thy god , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
observe and hear all these word which i command thee , that it may go well with thee , and with thy child after thee for ever , when thou doest that which be good and right in the sight of the lord thy god .
when the lord thy god shall cut off the nation from before thee , whither thou goest to possess they , and thou succeedest they , and dwellest in they land ;
take heed to thyself that thou be not snare by follow they , after that they be destroy from before thee ; and that thou enquire not after they god , say , how do these nation serve they god ? even so will i do likewise .
thou shalt not do so unto the lord thy god : for every abomination to the lord , which he hateth , have they do unto they god ; for even they son and they daughter they have burn in the fire to they god .
what thing soever i command you , observe to do it : thou shalt not add thereto , nor diminish from it .
if there arise among you a prophet , or a dreamer of dream , and giveth thee a sign or a wonder ,
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , whereof he speak unto thee , say , let we go after other god , which thou hast not know , and let we serve they ;
thou shalt not hearken unto the word of that prophet , or that dreamer of dream : for the lord you god proveth you , to know whether ye love the lord you god with all you heart and with all you soul .
ye shall walk after the lord you god , and fear he , and keep he commandment , and obey he voice , and ye shall serve he , and cleave unto he .
and that prophet , or that dreamer of dream , shall be put to death ; because he have speak to turn you away from the lord you god , which bring you out of the land of egypt , and redeem you out of the house of bondage , to thrust thee out of the way which the lord thy god command thee to walk in .
so shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee .
if thy brother , the son of thy mother , or thy son , or thy daughter , or the wife of thy bosom , or thy friend , which be as thine own soul , entice thee secretly , say , let we go and serve other god , which thou hast not know , thou , nor thy father ;
namely , of the god of the people which be round about you , nigh unto thee , or far off from thee , from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth ;
thou shalt not consent unto he , nor hearken unto he ; neither shall thine eye pity he , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceal he :
but thou shalt surely kill he ; thine hand shall be first upon he to put he to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
and thou shalt stone he with stone , that he die ; because he have seek to thrust thee away from the lord thy god , which bring thee out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage .
and all israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such wickedness as this be among you .
if thou shalt hear say in one of thy city , which the lord thy god have give thee to dwell there , say ,
certain man , the child of belial , be go out from among you , and have withdraw the inhabitant of they city , say , let we go and serve other god , which ye have not know ;
then shalt thou enquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination be work among you ;
thou shalt surely smite the inhabitant of that city with the edge of the sword , destroy it utterly , and all that be therein , and the cattle thereof , with the edge of the sword .
and thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof , and shalt burn with fire the city , and all the spoil thereof every whit , for the lord thy god : and it shall be a heap for ever ; it shall not be build again .
and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand : that the lord may turn from the fierceness of he anger , and shew thee mercy , and have compassion upon thee , and multiply thee , as he have swear unto thy father ;
when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the lord thy god , to keep all he commandment which i command thee this day , to do that which be right in the eye of the lord thy god .
ye be the child of the lord you god : ye shall not cut yourselve , nor make any baldness between you eye for the dead .
for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god , and the lord have choose thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nation that be upon the earth .
thou shalt not eat any abominable thing .
these be the beast which ye shall eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ,
the hart , and the roebuck , and the fallow deer , and the wild goat , and the pygarg , and the wild ox , and the chamoix .
and every beast that parteth the hoof , and cleaveth the cleft into two claw , and cheweth the cud among the beast , that ye shall eat .
nevertheless these ye shall not eat of they that chew the cud , or of they that divide the cloven hoof ; as the camel , and the hare , and the coney : for they chew the cud , but divide not the hoof ; therefore they be unclean unto you .
and the swine , because it divideth the hoof , yet cheweth not the cud , it be unclean unto you : ye shall not eat of they flesh , nor touch they dead carcase .
these ye shall eat of all that be in the water : all that have fin and scale shall ye eat :
and whatsoever have not fin and scale ye may not eat ; it be unclean unto you .
of all clean bird ye shall eat .
but these be they of which ye shall not eat : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray ,
and the glede , and the kite , and the vulture after he kind ,
and every raven after he kind ,
and the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after he kind ,
the little owl , and the great owl , and the swan ,
and the pelican , and the gier eagle , and the cormorant ,
and the stork , and the heron after she kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
and every creep thing that flieth be unclean unto you : they shall not be eat .
but of all clean fowl ye may eat .
ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself : thou shalt give it unto the stranger that be in thy gate , that he may eat it ; or thou mayest sell it unto a alien : for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god .
thou shalt not seethe a kid in he mother 's milk .
thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed , that the field bringeth forth year by year .
and thou shalt eat before the lord thy god , in the place which he shall choose to place he name there , the tithe of thy corn , of thy wine , and of thine oil , and the firstling of thy herd and of thy flock ; that thou mayest learn to fear the lord thy god always .
and if the way be too long for thee , so that thou art not able to carry it ; or if the place be too far from thee , which the lord thy god shall choose to set he name there , when the lord thy god have bless thee :
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose :
and thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after , for ox , or for sheep , or for wine , or for strong drink , or for whatsoever thy soul desireth : and thou shalt eat there before the lord thy god , and thou shalt rejoice , thou , and thine household ,
and the levite that be within thy gate ; thou shalt not forsake he ; for he have no part nor inheritance with thee .
at the end of three year thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gate :
and the levite , ( because he have no part nor inheritance with thee , ) and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , which be within thy gate , shall come , and shall eat and be satisfy ; that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest .
at the end of every seven year thou shalt make a release .
and this be the manner of the release : every creditor that lendeth ought unto he neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of he neighbour , or of he brother ; because it be call the lord 's release .
of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again : but that which be thine with thy brother thine hand shall release ;
save when there shall be no poor among you ; for the lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for a inheritance to possess it :
only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god , to observe to do all these commandment which i command thee this day .
for the lord thy god blesseth thee , as he promise thee : and thou shalt lend unto many nation , but thou shalt not borrow ; and thou shalt reign over many nation , but they shall not reign over thee .
if there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gate in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thine heart , nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother :
but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto he , and shalt surely lend he sufficient for he need , in that which he wanteth .
beware that there be not a think in thy wicked heart , say , the seventh year , the year of release , be at hand ; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother , and thou givest he nought ; and he cry unto the lord against thee , and it be sin unto thee .
thou shalt surely give he , and thine heart shall not be grieve when thou givest unto he : because that for this thing the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thy work , and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore i command thee , say , thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy needy , in thy land .
and if thy brother , a hebrew man , or a hebrew woman , be sell unto thee , and serve thee six year ; then in the seventh year thou shalt let he go free from thee .
and when thou sendest he out free from thee , thou shalt not let he go away empty :
thou shalt furnish he liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress : of that wherewith the lord thy god have bless thee thou shalt give unto he .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt , and the lord thy god redeem thee : therefore i command thee this thing to day .
and it shall be , if he say unto thee , i will not go away from thee ; because he loveth thee and thine house , because he be well with thee ;
then thou shalt take a aul , and thrust it through he ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever .
and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
it shall not seem hard unto thee , when thou sendest he away free from thee ; for he have be worth a double hire servant to thee , in serve thee six year : and the lord thy god shall bless thee in all that thou doest .
all the firstle male that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the lord thy god : thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock , nor shear the firstling of thy sheep .
thou shalt eat it before the lord thy god year by year in the place which the lord shall choose , thou and thy household .
and if there be any blemish therein , as if it be lame , or blind , or have any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the lord thy god .
thou shalt eat it within thy gate : the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike , as the roebuck , and as the hart .
only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof ; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water .
observe the month of abib , and keep the passover unto the lord thy god : for in the month of abib the lord thy god bring thee forth out of egypt by night .
thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god , of the flock and the herd , in the place which the lord shall choose to place he name there .
thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it ; seven day shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith , even the bread of affliction ; for thou camest forth out of the land of egypt in haste : that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of egypt all the day of thy life .
and there shall be no leavened bread see with thee in all thy coast seven day ; neither shall there any thing of the flesh , which thou sacrificedst the first day at even , remain all night until the morning .
thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gate , which the lord thy god giveth thee :
but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place he name in , there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even , at the go down of the sun , at the season that thou camest forth out of egypt .
and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the lord thy god shall choose : and thou shalt turn in the morning , and go unto thy tent .
six day thou shalt eat unleavened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the lord thy god : thou shalt do no work therein .
seven week shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven week from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn .
and thou shalt keep the feast of week unto the lord thy god with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand , which thou shalt give unto the lord thy god , accord as the lord thy god have bless thee :
and thou shalt rejoice before the lord thy god , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the levite that be within thy gate , and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that be among you , in the place which the lord thy god have choose to place he name there .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt : and thou shalt observe and do these statute .
thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacle seven day , after that thou hast gather in thy corn and thy wine :
and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the levite , the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that be within thy gate .
seven day shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the lord thy god in the place which the lord shall choose : because the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thine increase , and in all the work of thine hand , therefore thou shalt surely rejoice .
three time in a year shall all thy male appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose ; in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of week , and in the feast of tabernacle : and they shall not appear before the lord empty :
every man shall give as he be able , accord to the blessing of the lord thy god which he have give thee .
judges and officer shalt thou make thee in all thy gate , which the lord thy god giveth thee , throughout thy tribe : and they shall judge the people with just judgment .
thou shalt not wrest judgment ; thou shalt not respect person , neither take a gift : for a gift doth blind the eye of the wise , and pervert the word of the righteous .
that which be altogether just shalt thou follow , that thou mayest live , and inherit the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any tree near unto the altar of the lord thy god , which thou shalt make thee .
neither shalt thou set thee up any image ; which the lord thy god hateth .
thou shalt not sacrifice unto the lord thy god any bullock , or sheep , wherein be blemish , or any evilfavouredness : for that be a abomination unto the lord thy god .
if there be find among you , within any of thy gate which the lord thy god giveth thee , man or woman , that have work wickedness in the sight of the lord thy god , in transgress he covenant ,
and have go and serve other god , and worship they , either the sun , or moon , or any of the host of heaven , which i have not command ;
and it be tell thee , and thou hast hear of it , and enquire diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination be work in israel :
then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman , which have commit that wicked thing , unto thy gate , even that man or that woman , and shalt stone they with stone , till they die .
at the mouth of two witness , or three witness , shall he that be worthy of death be put to death ; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hand of the witness shall be first upon he to put he to death , and afterward the hand of all the people .
so thou shalt put the evil away from among you .
if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , be matter of controversy within thy gate : then shalt thou arise , and get thee up into the place which the lord thy god shall choose ;
and thou shalt come unto the priest the levites , and unto the judge that shall be in those day , and enquire ; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment :
and thou shalt do accord to the sentence , which they of that place which the lord shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do accord to all that they inform thee :
accord to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee , and accord to the judgment which they shall tell thee , thou shalt do : thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee , to the right hand , nor to the left .
and the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the lord thy god , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from israel .
and all the people shall hear , and fear , and do no more presumptuously .
when thou art come unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee , and shalt possess it , and shalt dwell therein , and shalt say , i will set a king over i , like as all the nation that be about i ;
thou shalt in any wise set he king over thee , whom the lord thy god shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which be not thy brother .
but he shall not multiply horse to himself , nor cause the people to return to egypt , to the end that he should multiply horse : forasmuch as the lord have say unto you , ye shall henceforth return no more that way .
neither shall he multiply wife to himself , that he heart turn not away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
and it shall be , when he sitteth upon the throne of he kingdom , that he shall write he a copy of this law in a book out of that which be before the priest the levites :
and it shall be with he , and he shall read therein all the day of he life : that he may learn to fear the lord he god , to keep all the word of this law and these statute , to do they :
that he heart be not lift up above he brethren , and that he turn not aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong he day in he kingdom , he , and he child , in the midst of israel .
the priest the levites , and all the tribe of levi , shall have no part nor inheritance with israel : they shall eat the offering of the lord make by fire , and he inheritance .
therefore shall they have no inheritance among they brethren : the lord be they inheritance , as he have say unto they .
and this shall be the priest 's due from the people , from they that offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep ; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder , and the two cheek , and the maw .
the firstfruit also of thy corn , of thy wine , and of thine oil , and the first of the fleece of thy sheep , shalt thou give he .
for the lord thy god have choose he out of all thy tribe , to stand to minister in the name of the lord , he and he son for ever .
and if a levite come from any of thy gate out of all israel , where he sojourn , and come with all the desire of he mind unto the place which the lord shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of the lord he god , as all he brethren the levites do , which stand there before the lord .
they shall have like portion to eat , beside that which cometh of the sale of he patrimony .
when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god giveth thee , thou shalt not learn to do after the abomination of those nation .
there shall not be find among you any one that maketh he son or he daughter to pass through the fire , or that useth divination , or a observer of time , or a enchanter , or a witch .
or a charmer , or a consulter with familiar spirit , or a wizard , or a necromancer .
for all that do these thing be a abomination unto the lord : and because of these abomination the lord thy god doth drive they out from before thee .
thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy god .
for these nation , which thou shalt possess , hearken unto observer of time , and unto diviner : but as for thee , the lord thy god have not suffer thee so to do .
the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like unto i ; unto he ye shall hearken ;
accord to all that thou desiredst of the lord thy god in horeb in the day of the assembly , say , let i not hear again the voice of the lord my god , neither let i see this great fire any more , that i die not .
and the lord say unto i , they have well speak that which they have speak .
i will raise they up a prophet from among they brethren , like unto thee , and will put my word in he mouth ; and he shall speak unto they all that i shall command he .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever will not hearken unto my word which he shall speak in my name , i will require it of he .
but the prophet , which shall presume to speak a word in my name , which i have not command he to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other god , even that prophet shall die .
and if thou say in thine heart , how shall we know the word which the lord have not speak ?
when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord , if the thing follow not , nor come to pass , that be the thing which the lord have not speak , but the prophet have speak it presumptuously : thou shalt not be afraid of he .
when the lord thy god have cut off the nation , whose land the lord thy god giveth thee , and thou succeedest they , and dwellest in they city , and in they house ;
thou shalt separate three city for thee in the midst of thy land , which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it .
thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the coast of thy land , which the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit , into three part , that every slayer may flee thither .
and this be the case of the slayer , which shall flee thither , that he may live : whoso killeth he neighbour ignorantly , whom he hate not in time past ;
as when a man goeth into the wood with he neighbour to hew wood , and he hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree , and the head slippeth from the helve , and lighteth upon he neighbour , that he die ; he shall flee unto one of those city , and live :
lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer , while he heart be hot , and overtake he , because the way be long , and slay he ; whereas he be not worthy of death , inasmuch as he hate he not in time past .
wherefore i command thee , say , thou shalt separate three city for thee .
and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast , as he have swear unto thy father , and give thee all the land which he promise to give unto thy father ;
if thou shalt keep all these commandment to do they , which i command thee this day , to love the lord thy god , and to walk ever in he way ; then shalt thou add three city more for thee , beside these three :
that innocent blood be not shed in thy land , which the lord thy god giveth thee for a inheritance , and so blood be upon thee .
but if any man hate he neighbour , and lie in wait for he , and rise up against he , and smite he mortally that he die , and fleeth into one of these city :
then the elder of he city shall send and fetch he thence , and deliver he into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
thine eye shall not pity he , but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from israel , that it may go well with thee .
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it .
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sinneth : at the mouth of two witness , or at the mouth of three witness , shall the matter be establish .
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against he that which be wrong ;
then both the man , between whom the controversy be , shall stand before the lord , before the priest and the judge , which shall be in those day ;
and the judge shall make diligent inquisition : and , behold , if the witness be a false witness , and have testify falsely against he brother ;
then shall ye do unto he , as he have think to have do unto he brother : so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
and those which remain shall hear , and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you .
and thine eye shall not pity ; but life shall go for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemy , and seest horse , and chariot , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of they : for the lord thy god be with thee , which bring thee up out of the land of egypt .
and it shall be , when ye be come nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people ,
and shall say unto they , hear , o israel , ye approach this day unto battle against you enemy : let not you heart faint , fear not , and do not tremble , neither be ye terrify because of they ;
for the lord you god be he that goeth with you , to fight for you against you enemy , to save you .
and the officer shall speak unto the people , say , what man be there that have build a new house , and have not dedicate it ? let he go and return to he house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
and what man be he that have plant a vineyard , and have not yet eat of it ? let he also go and return unto he house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and what man be there that have betroth a wife , and have not take she ? let he go and return unto he house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take she .
and the officer shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , what man be there that be fearful and faintheart ? let he go and return unto he house , lest he brethren 's heart faint as well as he heart .
and it shall be , when the officer have make a end of speak unto the people , that they shall make captain of the army to lead the people .
when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace unto it .
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that be find therein shall be tributary unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
and if it will make no peace with thee , but will make war against thee , then thou shalt besiege it :
and when the lord thy god have deliver it into thine hand , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
but the woman , and the little one , and the cattle , and all that be in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemy , which the lord thy god have give thee .
thus shalt thou do unto all the city which be very far off from thee , which be not of the city of these nation .
but of the city of these people , which the lord thy god doth give thee for a inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth :
but thou shalt utterly destroy they ; namely , the hittites , and the amorites , the canaanites , and the perizzites , the hivites , and the jebusites ; as the lord thy god have command thee :
that they teach you not to do after all they abomination , which they have do unto they god ; so should ye sin against the lord you god .
when thou shalt besiege a city a long time , in make war against it to take it , thou shalt not destroy the tree thereof by force a axe against they : for thou mayest eat of they , and thou shalt not cut they down ( for the tree of the field be man 's life ) to employ they in the siege :
only the tree which thou knowest that they be not tree for meat , thou shalt destroy and cut they down ; and thou shalt build bulwark against the city that maketh war with thee , until it be subdue .
if one be find slay in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it , lie in the field , and it be not know who have slay he :
then thy elder and thy judge shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the city which be round about he that be slay :
and it shall be , that the city which be next unto the slay man , even the elder of that city shall take a heifer , which have not be work with , and which have not draw in the yoke ;
and the elder of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley , which be neither eared nor sown , and shall strike off the heifer 's neck there in the valley :
and the priest the son of levi shall come near ; for they the lord thy god have choose to minister unto he , and to bless in the name of the lord ; and by they word shall every controversy and every stroke be try :
and all the elder of that city , that be next unto the slay man , shall wash they hand over the heifer that be behead in the valley :
and they shall answer and say , we hand have not shed this blood , neither have we eye see it .
be merciful , o lord , unto thy people israel , whom thou hast redeem , and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of israel 's charge .
and the blood shall be forgive they .
so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you , when thou shalt do that which be right in the sight of the lord .
when thou goest forth to war against thine enemy , and the lord thy god have deliver they into thine hand , and thou hast take they captive ,
and seest among the captive a beautiful woman , and hast a desire unto she , that thou wouldest have she to thy wife ;
then thou shalt bring she home to thine house ; and she shall shave she head , and pare she nail ;
and she shall put the raiment of she captivity from off she , and shall remain in thine house , and bewail she father and she mother a full month : and after that thou shalt go in unto she , and be she husband , and she shall be thy wife .
and it shall be , if thou have no delight in she , then thou shalt let she go whither she will ; but thou shalt not sell she at all for money , thou shalt not make merchandise of she , because thou hast humble she .
if a man have two wife , one beloved , and another hate , and they have bear he child , both the beloved and the hate ; and if the firstborn son be hers that be hate :
then it shall be , when he maketh he son to inherit that which he have , that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hate , which be indeed the firstborn :
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hate for the firstborn , by give he a double portion of all that he have : for he be the beginning of he strength ; the right of the firstborn be he .
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of he father , or the voice of he mother , and that , when they have chasten he , will not hearken unto they :
then shall he father and he mother lay hold on he , and bring he out unto the elder of he city , and unto the gate of he place ;
and they shall say unto the elder of he city , this we son be stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey we voice ; he be a glutton , and a drunkard .
and all the man of he city shall stone he with stone , that he die : so shalt thou put evil away from among you ; and all israel shall hear , and fear .
and if a man have commit a sin worthy of death , and he be to be put to death , and thou hang he on a tree :
he body shall not remain all night upon the tree , but thou shalt in any wise bury he that day ; ( for he that be hang be accurse of god ; ) that thy land be not defile , which the lord thy god giveth thee for a inheritance .
thou shalt not see thy brother 's ox or he sheep go astray , and hide thyself from they : thou shalt in any case bring they again unto thy brother .
and if thy brother be not nigh unto thee , or if thou know he not , then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house , and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it , and thou shalt restore it to he again .
in like manner shalt thou do with he ass ; and so shalt thou do with he raiment ; and with all lose thing of thy brother 's , which he have lose , and thou hast find , shalt thou do likewise : thou mayest not hide thyself .
thou shalt not see thy brother 's ass or he ox fall down by the way , and hide thyself from they : thou shalt surely help he to lift they up again .
the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's garment : for all that do so be abomination unto the lord thy god .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young one , or egg , and the dam sit upon the young , or upon the egg , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go , and take the young to thee ; that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy day .

thou shalt make thee fringe upon the four quarter of thy vesture , wherewith thou coverest thyself .
if any man take a wife , and go in unto she , and hate she ,
and give occasion of speech against she , and bring up a evil name upon she , and say , i take this woman , and when i come to she , i find she not a maid :
then shall the father of the damsel , and she mother , take and bring forth the token of the damsel 's virginity unto the elder of the city in the gate :
and the damsel 's father shall say unto the elder , i give my daughter unto this man to wife , and he hateth she ;
and , lo , he have give occasion of speech against she , say , i find not thy daughter a maid ; and yet these be the token of my daughter 's virginity .
and they shall spread the cloth before the elder of the city .
and the elder of that city shall take that man and chastise he ;
and they shall amerce he in a hundred shekel of silver , and give they unto the father of the damsel , because he have bring up a evil name upon a virgin of israel : and she shall be he wife ; he may not put she away all he day .
but if this thing be true , and the token of virginity be not find for the damsel :

but if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field , and the man force she , and lie with she : then the man only that lay with she shall die :
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there be in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against he neighbour , and slayeth he , even so be this matter :
for he find she in the field , and the betrothed damsel cry , and there be none to save she .
if a man find a damsel that be a virgin , which be not betroth , and lay hold on she , and lie with she , and they be find ;

thou shalt have a place also without the camp , whither thou shalt go forth abroad :
and thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon ; and it shall be , when thou wilt ease thyself abroad , thou shalt dig therewith , and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee :

but it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god , to observe to do all he commandment and he statute which i command thee this day ; that all these curse shall come upon thee , and overtake thee :
cursed shalt thou be in the city , and curse shalt thou be in the field .
cursed shall be thy basket and thy store .
cursed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy land , the increase of thy kine , and the flock of thy sheep .
cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and curse shalt thou be when thou goest out .
the lord shall send upon thee cursing , vexation , and rebuke , in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do , until thou be destroy , and until thou perish quickly ; because of the wickedness of thy doings , whereby thou hast forsake i .
the lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee , until he have consume thee from off the land , whither thou goest to possess it .
the lord shall smite thee with a consumption , and with a fever , and with a inflammation , and with a extreme burning , and with the sword , and with blast , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish .
and thy heaven that be over thy head shall be brass , and the earth that be under thee shall be iron .
the lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust : from heaven shall it come down upon thee , until thou be destroy .
the lord shall cause thee to be smite before thine enemy : thou shalt go out one way against they , and flee seven way before they : and shalt be remove into all the kingdom of the earth .
and thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowl of the air , and unto the beast of the earth , and no man shall fray they away .
the lord will smite thee with the botch of egypt , and with the emerod , and with the scab , and with the itch , whereof thou canst not be heal .
the lord shall smite thee with madness , and blindness , and astonishment of heart :
and thou shalt grope at noonday , as the blind gropeth in darkness , and thou shalt not prosper in thy way : and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoil evermore , and no man shall save thee .
thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with she : thou shalt build a house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grape thereof .
thine ox shall be slay before thine eye , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently take away from before thy face , and shall not be restore to thee : thy sheep shall be give unto thine enemy , and thou shalt have none to rescue they .
thy son and thy daughter shall be give unto another people , and thine eye shall look , and fail with longing for they all the day long : and there shall be no might in thine hand :
the fruit of thy land , and all thy labour , shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway :
so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eye which thou shalt see .
the lord shall smite thee in the knee , and in the leg , with a sore botch that can not be heal , from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head .
the lord shall bring thee , and thy king which thou shalt set over thee , unto a nation which neither thou nor thy father have know ; and there shalt thou serve other god , wood and stone .
and thou shalt become a astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all nation whither the lord shall lead thee .
thou shalt carry much seed out into the field , and shalt gather but little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
thou shalt plant vineyard , and dress they , but shalt neither drink of the wine , nor gather the grape ; for the worm shall eat they .
thou shalt have olive tree throughout all thy coast , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast he fruit .
thou shalt beget son and daughter , but thou shalt not enjoy they ; for they shall go into captivity .
all thy tree and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume .
the stranger that be within thee shall get up above thee very high ; and thou shalt come down very low .
he shall lend to thee , and thou shalt not lend to he : he shall be the head , and thou shalt be the tail .
moreover all these curse shall come upon thee , and shall pursue thee , and overtake thee , till thou be destroy ; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the lord thy god , to keep he commandment and he statute which he command thee :
and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder , and upon thy seed for ever .
because thou servedst not the lord thy god with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , for the abundance of all thing ;
therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy which the lord shall send against thee , in hunger , and in thirst , and in nakedness , and in want of all thing : and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck , until he have destroy thee .
the lord shall bring a nation against thee from far , from the end of the earth , as swift as the eagle flieth ; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand ;
a nation of fierce countenance , which shall not regard the person of the old , nor shew favour to the young :
and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle , and the fruit of thy land , until thou be destroy : which also shall not leave thee either corn , wine , or oil , or the increase of thy kine , or flock of thy sheep , until he have destroy thee .
and he shall besiege thee in all thy gate , until thy high and fenced wall come down , wherein thou trustedst , throughout all thy land : and he shall besiege thee in all thy gate throughout all thy land , which the lord thy god have give thee .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body , the flesh of thy son and of thy daughter , which the lord thy god have give thee , in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee :
so that the man that be tender among you , and very delicate , he eye shall be evil toward he brother , and toward the wife of he bosom , and toward the remnant of he child which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of they of the flesh of he child whom he shall eat : because he have nothing leave he in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in all thy gate .
the tender and delicate woman among you , which would not adventure to set the sole of she foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness , she eye shall be evil toward the husband of she bosom , and toward she son , and toward she daughter ,
and toward she young one that cometh out from between she foot , and toward she child which she shall bear : for she shall eat they for want of all thing secretly in the siege and straitness , wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gate .
if thou wilt not observe to do all the word of this law that be write in this book , that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name , the lord thy god ;
then the lord will make thy plague wonderful , and the plague of thy seed , even great plague , and of long continuance , and sore sickness , and of long continuance .
moreover he will bring upon thee all the disease of egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
also every sickness , and every plague , which be not write in the book of this law , they will the lord bring upon thee , until thou be destroy .
and ye shall be leave few in number , whereas ye be as the star of heaven for multitude ; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the lord thy god .
and it shall come to pass , that as the lord rejoice over you to do you good , and to multiply you ; so the lord will rejoice over you to destroy you , and to bring you to nought ; and ye shall be pluck from off the land whither thou goest to possess it .
and the lord shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other god , which neither thou nor thy father have know , even wood and stone .
and among these nation shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest : but the lord shall give thee there a tremble heart , and fail of eye , and sorrow of mind :
and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee ; and thou shalt fear day and night , and shalt have none assurance of thy life :
in the morning thou shalt say , would god it be even ! and at even thou shalt say , would god it be morning ! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear , and for the sight of thine eye which thou shalt see .
and the lord shall bring thee into egypt again with ship , by the way whereof i speak unto thee , thou shalt see it no more again : and there ye shall be sell unto you enemy for bondman and bondwoman , and no man shall buy you .
these be the word of the covenant , which the lord command moses to make with the child of israel in the land of moab , beside the covenant which he make with they in horeb .
and moses call unto all israel , and say unto they , ye have see all that the lord do before you eye in the land of egypt unto pharaoh , and unto all he servant , and unto all he land ;
the great temptation which thine eye have see , the sign , and those great miracle :
yet the lord have not give you a heart to perceive , and eye to see , and ear to hear , unto this day .
and i have lead you forty year in the wilderness : you clothes be not waxen old upon you , and thy shoe be not waxen old upon thy foot .
ye have not eat bread , neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink : that ye might know that i be the lord you god .
and when ye come unto this place , sihon the king of heshbon , and og the king of bashan , come out against we unto battle , and we smite they :
and we take they land , and give it for a inheritance unto the reubenites , and to the gadites , and to the half tribe of manasseh .
keep therefore the word of this covenant , and do they , that ye may prosper in all that ye do .
ye stand this day all of you before the lord you god ; you captain of you tribe , you elder , and you officer , with all the man of israel ,
you little one , you wife , and thy stranger that be in thy camp , from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water :
that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the lord thy god , and into he oath , which the lord thy god maketh with thee this day :
that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself , and that he may be unto thee a god , as he have say unto thee , and as he have swear unto thy father , to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob .
neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath ;
but with he that standeth here with we this day before the lord we god , and also with he that be not here with we this day :
( for ye know how we have dwell in the land of egypt ; and how we come through the nation which ye pass by ;
and ye have see they abomination , and they idol , wood and stone , silver and gold , which be among they : )
lest there should be among you man , or woman , or family , or tribe , whose heart turneth away this day from the lord we god , to go and serve the god of these nation ; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood ;
and it come to pass , when he heareth the word of this curse , that he bless himself in he heart , say , i shall have peace , though i walk in the imagination of mine heart , to add drunkenness to thirst :
the lord will not spare he , but then the anger of the lord and he jealousy shall smoke against that man , and all the curse that be write in this book shall lie upon he , and the lord shall blot out he name from under heaven .
and the lord shall separate he unto evil out of all the tribe of israel , accord to all the curse of the covenant that be write in this book of the law :
so that the generation to come of you child that shall rise up after you , and the stranger that shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plague of that land , and the sickness which the lord have lay upon it ;
and that the whole land thereof be brimstone , and salt , and burning , that it be not sow , nor beareth , nor any grass groweth therein , like the overthrow of sodom , and gomorrah , admah , and zeboim , which the lord overthrow in he anger , and in he wrath :
even all nation shall say , wherefore have the lord do thus unto this land ? what meaneth the heat of this great anger ?
then man shall say , because they have forsake the covenant of the lord god of they father , which he make with they when he bring they forth out of the land of egypt :
for they go and serve other god , and worship they , god whom they know not , and whom he have not give unto they :
and the anger of the lord be kindle against this land , to bring upon it all the curse that be write in this book :
and the lord root they out of they land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast they into another land , as it be this day .
the secret thing belong unto the lord we god : but those thing which be reveal belong unto we and to we child for ever , that we may do all the word of this law .
and it shall come to pass , when all these thing be come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which i have set before thee , and thou shalt call they to mind among all the nation , whither the lord thy god have drive thee ,
and shalt return unto the lord thy god , and shalt obey he voice accord to all that i command thee this day , thou and thy child , with all thine heart , and with all thy soul ;
that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity , and have compassion upon thee , and will return and gather thee from all the nation , whither the lord thy god have scatter thee .
if any of thine be drive out unto the outmost part of heaven , from thence will the lord thy god gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land which thy father possess , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above thy father .
and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of thy seed , to love the lord thy god with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , that thou mayest live .
and the lord thy god will put all these curse upon thine enemy , and on they that hate thee , which persecute thee .
and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord , and do all he commandment which i command thee this day .
and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy land , for good : for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good , as he rejoice over thy father :
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god , to keep he commandment and he statute which be write in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
for this commandment which i command thee this day , it be not hide from thee , neither be it far off .
it be not in heaven , that thou shouldest say , who shall go up for we to heaven , and bring it unto we , that we may hear it , and do it ?
neither be it beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , who shall go over the sea for we , and bring it unto we , that we may hear it , and do it ?
but the word be very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou mayest do it .
see , i have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ;
in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy god , to walk in he way , and to keep he commandment and he statute and he judgment , that thou mayest live and multiply : and the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
but if thine heart turn away , so that thou wilt not hear , but shalt be draw away , and worship other god , and serve they ;
i denounce unto you this day , that ye shall surely perish , and that ye shall not prolong you day upon the land , whither thou passest over jordan to go to possess it .
i call heaven and earth to record this day against you , that i have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing : therefore choose life , that both thou and thy seed may live :
that thou mayest love the lord thy god , and that thou mayest obey he voice , and that thou mayest cleave unto he : for he be thy life , and the length of thy day : that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord sware unto thy father , to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob , to give they .
and moses go and speak these word unto all israel .
and he say unto they , i be a hundred and twenty year old this day ; i can no more go out and come in : also the lord have say unto i , thou shalt not go over this jordan .
the lord thy god , he will go over before thee , and he will destroy these nation from before thee , and thou shalt possess they : and joshua , he shall go over before thee , as the lord have say .
and the lord shall do unto they as he do to sihon and to og , king of the amorites , and unto the land of they , whom he destroy .
and the lord shall give they up before you face , that ye may do unto they accord unto all the commandment which i have command you .
be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of they : for the lord thy god , he it be that doth go with thee ; he will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
and moses call unto joshua , and say unto he in the sight of all israel , be strong and of a good courage : for thou must go with this people unto the land which the lord have swear unto they father to give they ; and thou shalt cause they to inherit it .
and the lord , he it be that doth go before thee ; he will be with thee , he will not fail thee , neither forsake thee : fear not , neither be dismay .
and moses write this law , and deliver it unto the priest the son of levi , which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord , and unto all the elder of israel .
and moses command they , say , at the end of every seven year , in the solemnity of the year of release , in the feast of tabernacle ,
when all israel be come to appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all israel in they hearing .
gather the people together , man , and woman , and child , and thy stranger that be within thy gate , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the lord you god , and observe to do all the word of this law :
and that they child , which have not know any thing , may hear , and learn to fear the lord you god , as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it .
and the lord say unto mose , behold , thy day approach that thou must die : call joshua , and present yourselve in the tabernacle of the congregation , that i may give he a charge .
and moses and joshua go , and present themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation .
and the lord appear in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud : and the pillar of the cloud stand over the door of the tabernacle .
and the lord say unto mose , behold , thou shalt sleep with thy father ; and this people will rise up , and go a whoring after the god of the stranger of the land , whither they go to be among they , and will forsake i , and break my covenant which i have make with they .
then my anger shall be kindle against they in that day , and i will forsake they , and i will hide my face from they , and they shall be devour , and many evil and trouble shall befall they ; so that they will say in that day , be not these evil come upon we , because we god be not among we ?
and i will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have work , in that they be turn unto other god .
now therefore write ye this song for you , and teach it the child of israel : put it in they mouth , that this song may be a witness for i against the child of israel .
for when i shall have bring they into the land which i sware unto they father , that floweth with milk and honey ; and they shall have eat and fill themselves , and waxen fat ; then will they turn unto other god , and serve they , and provoke i , and break my covenant .
and it shall come to pass , when many evil and trouble be befall they , that this song shall testify against they as a witness ; for it shall not be forget out of the mouth of they seed : for i know they imagination which they go about , even now , before i have bring they into the land which i sware .
moses therefore write this song the same day , and teach it the child of israel .
and he give joshua the son of nun a charge , and say , be strong and of a good courage : for thou shalt bring the child of israel into the land which i sware unto they : and i will be with thee .
and it come to pass , when moses have make a end of write the word of this law in a book , until they be finish ,
that mose command the levites , which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord , say ,
take this book of the law , and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the lord you god , that it may be there for a witness against thee .
for i know thy rebellion , and thy stiff neck : behold , while i be yet alive with you this day , ye have be rebellious against the lord ; and how much more after my death ?
gather unto i all the elder of you tribe , and you officer , that i may speak these word in they ear , and call heaven and earth to record against they .
for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselve , and turn aside from the way which i have command you ; and evil will befall you in the latter day ; because ye will do evil in the sight of the lord , to provoke he to anger through the work of you hand .
and moses spake in the ear of all the congregation of israel the word of this song , until they be end .
give ear , o ye heaven , and i will speak ; and hear , o earth , the word of my mouth .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distil as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the shower upon the grass :
because i will publish the name of the lord : ascribe ye greatness unto we god .
he be the rock , he work be perfect : for all he way be judgment : a god of truth and without iniquity , just and right be he .
they have corrupt themselves , they spot be not the spot of he child : they be a perverse and crooked generation .
do ye thus requite the lord , o foolish people and unwise ? be not he thy father that have buy thee ? have he not make thee , and established thee ?
remember the day of old , consider the year of many generation : ask thy father , and he will shew thee ; thy elder , and they will tell thee .
when the most high divide to the nation they inheritance , when he separate the son of adam , he set the bound of the people accord to the number of the child of israel .
for the lord 's portion be he people ; jacob be the lot of he inheritance .
he find he in a desert land , and in the waste howling wilderness ; he lead he about , he instruct he , he keep he as the apple of he eye .
as a eagle stirreth up she nest , fluttereth over she young , spreadeth abroad she wing , taketh they , beareth they on she wing :
so the lord alone do lead he , and there be no strange god with he .
he make he ride on the high place of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the field ; and he make he to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock ;
butter of kine , and milk of sheep , with fat of lamb , and ram of the breed of bashan , and goat , with the fat of kidney of wheat ; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape .
but jeshurun wax fat , and kick : thou art waxen fat , thou art grow thick , thou art cover with fatness ; then he forsake god which make he , and lightly esteem the rock of he salvation .
they provoke he to jealousy with strange god , with abomination provoke they he to anger .
they sacrifice unto devil , not to god ; to god whom they know not , to new god that come newly up , whom you father fear not .
of the rock that beget thee thou art unmindful , and hast forget god that form thee .
and when the lord see it , he abhor they , because of the provoke of he son , and of he daughter .
and he say , i will hide my face from they , i will see what they end shall be : for they be a very froward generation , child in whom be no faith .
they have move i to jealousy with that which be not god ; they have provoke i to anger with they vanity : and i will move they to jealousy with those which be not a people ; i will provoke they to anger with a foolish nation .
for a fire be kindle in mine anger , and shall burn unto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with she increase , and set on fire the foundation of the mountain .
i will heap mischief upon they ; i will spend mine arrow upon they .
they shall be burn with hunger , and devour with burn heat , and with bitter destruction : i will also send the tooth of beast upon they , with the poison of serpent of the dust .
the sword without , and terror within , shall destroy both the young man and the virgin , the suckling also with the man of gray hair .
i say , i would scatter they into corner , i would make the remembrance of they to cease from among man :
be it not that i fear the wrath of the enemy , lest they adversary should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , we hand be high , and the lord have not do all this .
for they be a nation void of counsel , neither be there any understanding in they .
o that they be wise , that they understand this , that they would consider they latter end !
how should one chase a thousand , and two put ten thousand to flight , except they rock have sell they , and the lord have shut they up ?
for they rock be not as we rock , even we enemy themselves be judge .
for they vine be of the vine of sodom , and of the field of gomorrah : they grape be grape of gall , they cluster be bitter :
they wine be the poison of dragon , and the cruel venom of asp .
be not this lay up in store with i , and seal up among my treasure ?
to i belongeth vengeance , and recompence ; they foot shall slide in due time : for the day of they calamity be at hand , and the thing that shall come upon they make haste .
for the lord shall judge he people , and repent himself for he servant , when he seeth that they power be go , and there be none shut up , or leave .
and he shall say , where be they god , they rock in whom they trust ,
which do eat the fat of they sacrifice , and drink the wine of they drink offering ? let they rise up and help you , and be you protection .
see now that i , even i , be he , and there be no god with i : i kill , and i make alive ; i wind , and i heal : neither be there any that can deliver out of my hand .
for i lift up my hand to heaven , and say , i live for ever .
if i whet my glittering sword , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; i will render vengeance to mine enemy , and will reward they that hate i .
i will make mine arrow drunk with blood , and my sword shall devour flesh ; and that with the blood of the slay and of the captive , from the beginning of revenge upon the enemy .
rejoice , o ye nation , with he people : for he will avenge the blood of he servant , and will render vengeance to he adversary , and will be merciful unto he land , and to he people .
and moses come and speak all the word of this song in the ear of the people , he , and hoshea the son of nun .
and moses make a end of speak all these word to all israel :
and he say unto they , set you heart unto all the word which i testify among you this day , which ye shall command you child to observe to do , all the word of this law .
for it be not a vain thing for you ; because it be you life : and through this thing ye shall prolong you day in the land , whither ye go over jordan to possess it .
and the lord speak unto mose that selfsame day , say ,
get thee up into this mountain abarim , unto mount nebo , which be in the land of moab , that be over against jericho ; and behold the land of canaan , which i give unto the child of israel for a possession :
and die in the mount whither thou goest up , and be gather unto thy people ; as aaron thy brother die in mount hor , and be gather unto he people :
because ye trespass against i among the child of israel at the water of meribahkadesh , in the wilderness of zin ; because ye sanctify i not in the midst of the child of israel .
yet thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which i give the child of israel .
and this be the blessing , wherewith mose the man of god bless the child of israel before he death .
and he say , the lord come from sinai , and rise up from seir unto they ; he shine forth from mount paran , and he come with ten thousand of saint : from he right hand go a fiery law for they .
yea , he love the people ; all he saint be in thy hand : and they sit down at thy foot ; every one shall receive of thy word .
moses command we a law , even the inheritance of the congregation of jacob .
and he be king in jeshurun , when the head of the people and the tribe of israel be gather together .
let reuben live , and not die ; and let not he man be few .
and this be the blessing of judah : and he say , hear , lord , the voice of judah , and bring he unto he people : let he hand be sufficient for he ; and be thou a help to he from he enemy .
and of levi he say , let thy thummim and thy urim be with thy holy one , whom thou didst prove at massah , and with whom thou didst strive at the water of meribah ;
who say unto he father and to he mother , i have not see he ; neither do he acknowledge he brethren , nor know he own child : for they have observe thy word , and keep thy covenant .
they shall teach jacob thy judgment , and israel thy law : they shall put incense before thee , and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar .
bless , lord , he substance , and accept the work of he hand : smite through the loin of they that rise against he , and of they that hate he , that they rise not again .
and of benjamin he say , the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by he ; and the lord shall cover he all the day long , and he shall dwell between he shoulder .
and of joseph he say , bless of the lord be he land , for the precious thing of heaven , for the dew , and for the deep that coucheth beneath ,
and for the precious fruit bring forth by the sun , and for the precious thing put forth by the moon ,
and for the chief thing of the ancient mountain , and for the precious thing of the lasting hill ,
and for the precious thing of the earth and fulness thereof , and for the good will of he that dwelt in the bush : let the blessing come upon the head of joseph , and upon the top of the head of he that be separate from he brethren .
he glory be like the firstling of he bullock , and he horn be like the horn of unicorn : with they he shall push the people together to the end of the earth : and they be the ten thousand of ephraim , and they be the thousand of manasseh .
and of zebulun he say , rejoice , zebulun , in thy go out ; and , issachar , in thy tent .
they shall call the people unto the mountain ; there they shall offer sacrifice of righteousness : for they shall suck of the abundance of the sea , and of treasure hide in the sand .
and of gad he say , blessed be he that enlargeth gad : he dwelleth as a lion , and teareth the arm with the crown of the head .
and he provide the first part for himself , because there , in a portion of the lawgiver , be he seat ; and he come with the head of the people , he execute the justice of the lord , and he judgment with israel .
and of dan he say , dan be a lion 's whelp : he shall leap from bashan .
and of naphtali he say , o naphtali , satisfy with favour , and full with the blessing of the lord : possess thou the west and the south .
and of asher he say , let asher be bless with child ; let he be acceptable to he brethren , and let he dip he foot in oil .
thy shoe shall be iron and brass ; and as thy day , so shall thy strength be .
there be none like unto the god of jeshurun , who rideth upon the heaven in thy help , and in he excellency on the sky .
the eternal god be thy refuge , and underneath be the everlasting arm : and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee ; and shall say , destroy they .
israel then shall dwell in safety alone : the fountain of jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine ; also he heaven shall drop down dew .
happy art thou , o israel : who be like unto thee , o people save by the lord , the shield of thy help , and who be the sword of thy excellency ! and thine enemy shall be find liar unto thee ; and thou shalt tread upon they high place .
and moses go up from the plain of moab unto the mountain of nebo , to the top of pisgah , that be over against jericho .
and the lord shew he all the land of gilead , unto dan ,
and all naphtali , and the land of ephraim , and manasseh , and all the land of judah , unto the utmost sea ,
and the south , and the plain of the valley of jericho , the city of palm tree , unto zoar .
and the lord say unto he , this be the land which i sware unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob , say , i will give it unto thy seed : i have cause thee to see it with thine eye , but thou shalt not go over thither .
so mose the servant of the lord die there in the land of moab , accord to the word of the lord .
and he bury he in a valley in the land of moab , over against bethpeor : but no man knoweth of he sepulchre unto this day .
and moses be a hundred and twenty year old when he die : he eye be not dim , nor he natural force abate .
and the child of israel weep for moses in the plain of moab thirty day : so the day of weep and mourn for mose be end .
and joshua the son of nun be full of the spirit of wisdom ; for moses have lay he hand upon he : and the child of israel hearken unto he , and do as the lord command moses .
and there arise not a prophet since in israel like unto moses , whom the lord know face to face ,
in all the sign and the wonder , which the lord send he to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh , and to all he servant , and to all he land ,
and in all that mighty hand , and in all the great terror which mose shew in the sight of all israel .
now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it come to pass , that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun , moses ' minister , say ,
moses my servant be dead ; now therefore arise , go over this jordan , thou , and all this people , unto the land which i do give to they , even to the child of israel .
every place that the sole of you foot shall tread upon , that have i give unto you , as i say unto mose .
from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river , the river euphrates , all the land of the hittites , and unto the great sea toward the go down of the sun , shall be you coast .
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the day of thy life : as i be with mose , so i will be with thee : i will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
be strong and of a good courage : for unto this people shalt thou divide for a inheritance the land , which i sware unto they father to give they .
only be thou strong and very courageous , that thou mayest observe to do accord to all the law , which mose my servant command thee : turn not from it to the right hand or to the leave , that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest .
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest observe to do accord to all that be write therein : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
have not i command thee ?
be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed : for the lord thy god be with thee whithersoever thou goest .
then joshua command the officer of the people , say ,
pass through the host , and command the people , say , prepare you victuals ; for within three day ye shall pass over this jordan , to go in to possess the land , which the lord you god giveth you to possess it .
and to the reubenites , and to the gadites , and to half the tribe of manasseh , spake joshua , say ,
remember the word which mose the servant of the lord command you , say , the lord you god have give you rest , and have give you this land .
you wife , you little one , and you cattle , shall remain in the land which moses give you on this side jordan ; but ye shall pass before you brethren arm , all the mighty man of valour , and help they ;
until the lord have give you brethren rest , as he have give you , and they also have possess the land which the lord you god giveth they : then ye shall return unto the land of you possession , and enjoy it , which mose the lord 's servant give you on this side jordan toward the sunrising .
and they answer joshua , say , all that thou commandest we we will do , and whithersoever thou sendest we , we will go .
accord as we hearken unto mose in all thing , so will we hearken unto thee : only the lord thy god be with thee , as he be with mose .
whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment , and will not hearken unto thy word in all that thou commandest he , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
and joshua the son of nun send out of shittim two man to spy secretly , say , go view the land , even jericho .
and they go , and come into a harlot 's house , name rahab , and lodge there .
and it be tell the king of jericho , say , behold , there come man in hither to night of the child of israel to search out the country .
and the king of jericho send unto rahab , say , bring forth the man that be come to thee , which be enter into thine house : for they be come to search out all the country .
and the woman take the two man , and hide they , and say thus , there come man unto i , but i wist not whence they be :
and it come to pass about the time of shut of the gate , when it be dark , that the man go out : whither the man go i wot not : pursue after they quickly ; for ye shall overtake they .
but she have bring they up to the roof of the house , and hide they with the stalk of flax , which she have lay in order upon the roof .
and the man pursue after they the way to jordan unto the ford : and as soon as they which pursue after they be go out , they shut the gate .
and before they be lay down , she come up unto they upon the roof ;
and she say unto the man , i know that the lord have give you the land , and that you terror be fall upon we , and that all the inhabitant of the land faint because of you .
for we have hear how the lord dry up the water of the red sea for you , when ye come out of egypt ; and what ye do unto the two king of the amorites , that be on the other side jordan , sihon and og , whom ye utterly destroy .
and as soon as we have hear these thing , we heart do melt , neither do there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the lord you god , he be god in heaven above , and in earth beneath .
now therefore , i pray you , swear unto i by the lord , since i have shew you kindness , that ye will also shew kindness unto my father 's house , and give i a true token :
and that ye will save alive my father , and my mother , and my brethren , and my sister , and all that they have , and deliver we life from death .
and the man answer she , we life for yours , if ye utter not this we business .
and it shall be , when the lord have give we the land , that we will deal kindly and truly with thee .
then she let they down by a cord through the window : for she house be upon the town wall , and she dwell upon the wall .
and she say unto they , get you to the mountain , lest the pursuer meet you ; and hide yourselve there three day , until the pursuer be return : and afterward may ye go you way .
and the man say unto she , we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast make we swear .
behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let we down by : and thou shalt bring thy father , and thy mother , and thy brethren , and all thy father 's household , home unto thee .
and it shall be , that whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house into the street , he blood shall be upon he head , and we will be guiltless : and whosoever shall be with thee in the house , he blood shall be on we head , if any hand be upon he .
and if thou utter this we business , then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast make we to swear .
and she say , accord unto you word , so be it .
and she send they away , and they depart : and she bind the scarlet line in the window .
and they go , and come unto the mountain , and abode there three day , until the pursuer be return : and the pursuer seek they throughout all the way , but find they not .
so the two man return , and descend from the mountain , and pass over , and come to joshua the son of nun , and tell he all thing that befall they :
and they say unto joshua , truly the lord have deliver into we hand all the land ; for even all the inhabitant of the country do faint because of we .
and joshua rise early in the morning ; and they remove from shittim , and come to jordan , he and all the child of israel , and lodge there before they pass over .
and it come to pass after three day , that the officer go through the host ;
and they command the people , say , when ye see the ark of the covenant of the lord you god , and the priest the levites bear it , then ye shall remove from you place , and go after it .
yet there shall be a space between you and it , about two thousand cubit by measure : come not near unto it , that ye may know the way by which ye must go : for ye have not pass this way heretofore .
and joshua say unto the people , sanctify yourselve : for to morrow the lord will do wonder among you .
and joshua spake unto the priest , say , take up the ark of the covenant , and pass over before the people .
and they take up the ark of the covenant , and go before the people .
and the lord say unto joshua , this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel , that they may know that , as i be with mose , so i will be with thee .
and thou shalt command the priest that bear the ark of the covenant , say , when ye be come to the brink of the water of jordan , ye shall stand still in jordan .
and joshua say unto the child of israel , come hither , and hear the word of the lord you god .
and joshua say , hereby ye shall know that the living god be among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites , and the hittites , and the hivites , and the perizzites , and the girgashites , and the amorites , and the jebusites .
behold , the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into jordan .
now therefore take you twelve man out of the tribe of israel , out of every tribe a man .
and it shall come to pass , as soon as the sole of the foot of the priest that bear the ark of the lord , the lord of all the earth , shall rest in the water of jordan , that the water of jordan shall be cut off from the water that come down from above ; and they shall stand upon a heap .
and it come to pass , when the people remove from they tent , to pass over jordan , and the priest bear the ark of the covenant before the people ;
and as they that bare the ark be come unto jordan , and the foot of the priest that bare the ark be dip in the brim of the water , ( for jordan overfloweth all he bank all the time of harvest , )
that the water which come down from above stand and rise up upon a heap very far from the city adam , that be beside zaretan : and those that come down toward the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , fail , and be cut off : and the people pass over right against jericho .
and the priest that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord stand firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan , and all the israelites pass over on dry ground , until all the people be pass clean over jordan .
and it come to pass , when all the people be clean pass over jordan , that the lord spake unto joshua , say ,
take you twelve man out of the people , out of every tribe a man ,
and command ye they , say , take you hence out of the midst of jordan , out of the place where the priest ' foot stand firm , twelve stone , and ye shall carry they over with you , and leave they in the lodging place , where ye shall lodge this night .
then joshua call the twelve man , whom he have prepare of the child of israel , out of every tribe a man :
and joshua say unto they , pass over before the ark of the lord you god into the midst of jordan , and take you up every man of you a stone upon he shoulder , accord unto the number of the tribe of the child of israel :
that this may be a sign among you , that when you child ask they father in time to come , say , what mean ye by these stone ?
then ye shall answer they , that the water of jordan be cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord ; when it pass over jordan , the water of jordan be cut off : and these stone shall be for a memorial unto the child of israel for ever .
and the child of israel do so as joshua command , and take up twelve stone out of the midst of jordan , as the lord spake unto joshua , accord to the number of the tribe of the child of israel , and carry they over with they unto the place where they lodge , and lay they down there .
and joshua set up twelve stone in the midst of jordan , in the place where the foot of the priest which bare the ark of the covenant stand : and they be there unto this day .
for the priest which bare the ark stand in the midst of jordan , until everything be finish that the lord command joshua to speak unto the people , accord to all that moses command joshua : and the people hast and pass over .
and it come to pass , when all the people be clean pass over , that the ark of the lord pass over , and the priest , in the presence of the people .
and the child of reuben , and the child of gad , and half the tribe of manasseh , pass over arm before the child of israel , as moses spake unto they :
about forty thousand prepare for war pass over before the lord unto battle , to the plain of jericho .
on that day the lord magnify joshua in the sight of all israel ; and they fear he , as they fear moses , all the day of he life .
and the lord spake unto joshua , say ,
command the priest that bear the ark of the testimony , that they come up out of jordan .
joshua therefore command the priest , say , come ye up out of jordan .
and it come to pass , when the priest that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord be come up out of the midst of jordan , and the sole of the priest ' foot be lift up unto the dry land , that the water of jordan return unto they place , and flow over all he bank , as they do before .
and the people come up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamp in gilgal , in the east border of jericho .
and those twelve stone , which they take out of jordan , do joshua pitch in gilgal .
and he speak unto the child of israel , say , when you child shall ask they father in time to come , say , what mean these stone ?
then ye shall let you child know , say , israel come over this jordan on dry land .
for the lord you god dry up the water of jordan from before you , until ye be pass over , as the lord you god do to the red sea , which he dry up from before we , until we be go over :
that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord , that it be mighty : that ye might fear the lord you god for ever .
and it come to pass , when all the king of the amorites , which be on the side of jordan westward , and all the king of the canaanites , which be by the sea , hear that the lord have dry up the water of jordan from before the child of israel , until we be pass over , that they heart melt , neither be there spirit in they any more , because of the child of israel .
at that time the lord say unto joshua , make thee sharp knife , and circumcise again the child of israel the second time .
and joshua make he sharp knife , and circumcise the child of israel at the hill of the foreskin .
and this be the cause why joshua do circumcise : all the people that come out of egypt , that be male , even all the man of war , die in the wilderness by the way , after they come out of egypt .
now all the people that come out be circumcise : but all the people that be bear in the wilderness by the way as they come forth out of egypt , they they have not circumcise .
for the child of israel walk forty year in the wilderness , till all the people that be man of war , which come out of egypt , be consume , because they obey not the voice of the lord : unto whom the lord sware that he would not shew they the land , which the lord sware unto they father that he would give we , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
and they child , whom he raise up in they stead , they joshua circumcise : for they be uncircumcised , because they have not circumcise they by the way .
and it come to pass , when they have do circumcise all the people , that they abide in they place in the camp , till they be whole .
and the lord say unto joshua , this day have i roll away the reproach of egypt from off you .
wherefore the name of the place be call gilgal unto this day .
and the child of israel encamped in gilgal , and keep the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plain of jericho .
and they do eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover , unleavened cake , and parched corn in the selfsame day .
and the manna cease on the morrow after they have eat of the old corn of the land ; neither have the child of israel manna any more ; but they do eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year .
and it come to pass , when joshua be by jericho , that he lift up he eye and look , and , behold , there stand a man over against he with he sword draw in he hand : and joshua go unto he , and say unto he , art thou for we , or for we adversary ?
and he say , nay ; but as captain of the host of the lord be i now come .
and joshua fall on he face to the earth , and do worship , and say unto he , what saith my lord unto he servant ?
and the captain of the lord 's host say unto joshua , loose thy shoe from off thy foot ; for the place whereon thou standest be holy .
and joshua do so .
now jericho be straitly shut up because of the child of israel : none go out , and none come in .
and the lord say unto joshua , see , i have give into thine hand jericho , and the king thereof , and the mighty man of valour .
and ye shall compass the city , all ye man of war , and go round about the city once .
thus shalt thou do six day .
and seven priest shall bear before the ark seven trumpet of ram ' horn : and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven time , and the priest shall blow with the trumpet .
and it shall come to pass , that when they make a long blast with the ram 's horn , and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet , all the people shall shout with a great shout ; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat , and the people shall ascend up every man straight before he .
and joshua the son of nun call the priest , and say unto they , take up the ark of the covenant , and let seven priest bear seven trumpet of ram ' horn before the ark of the lord .
and he say unto the people , pass on , and compass the city , and let he that be armed pass on before the ark of the lord .
and it come to pass , when joshua have speak unto the people , that the seven priest bear the seven trumpet of ram ' horn pass on before the lord , and blow with the trumpet : and the ark of the covenant of the lord follow they .
and the armed man go before the priest that blow with the trumpet , and the rereward come after the ark , the priest go on , and blow with the trumpet .
and joshua have command the people , say , ye shall not shout , nor make any noise with you voice , neither shall any word proceed out of you mouth , until the day i bid you shout ; then shall ye shout .
so the ark of the lord compass the city , go about it once : and they come into the camp , and lodge in the camp .
and joshua rise early in the morning , and the priest take up the ark of the lord .
and seven priest bear seven trumpet of ram ' horn before the ark of the lord go on continually , and blow with the trumpet : and the armed man go before they ; but the rereward come after the ark of the lord , the priest go on , and blow with the trumpet .
and the second day they compass the city once , and return into the camp : so they do six day .
and it come to pass on the seventh day , that they rise early about the dawn of the day , and compass the city after the same manner seven time : only on that day they compass the city seven time .
and it come to pass at the seventh time , when the priest blow with the trumpet , joshua say unto the people , shout ; for the lord have give you the city .
and the city shall be accurse , even it , and all that be therein , to the lord : only rahab the harlot shall live , she and all that be with she in the house , because she hide the messenger that we send .
and ye , in any wise keep yourselve from the accursed thing , lest ye make yourselve accursed , when ye take of the accursed thing , and make the camp of israel a curse , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessel of brass and iron , be consecrate unto the lord : they shall come into the treasury of the lord .
so the people shout when the priest blow with the trumpet : and it come to pass , when the people hear the sound of the trumpet , and the people shout with a great shout , that the wall fall down flat , so that the people go up into the city , every man straight before he , and they take the city .
and they utterly destroy all that be in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and ox , and sheep , and ass , with the edge of the sword .
but joshua have say unto the two man that have spy out the country , go into the harlot 's house , and bring out thence the woman , and all that she have , as ye sware unto she .
and the young man that be spy go in , and bring out rahab , and she father , and she mother , and she brethren , and all that she have ; and they bring out all she kindred , and leave they without the camp of israel .
and they burn the city with fire , and all that be therein : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessel of brass and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the lord .
and joshua save rahab the harlot alive , and she father 's household , and all that she have ; and she dwelleth in israel even unto this day ; because she hide the messenger , which joshua send to spy out jericho .
and joshua adjure they at that time , say , cursed be the man before the lord , that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho : he shall lay the foundation thereof in he firstborn , and in he youngest son shall he set up the gate of it .
so the lord be with joshua ; and he fame be noised throughout all the country .
but the child of israel commit a trespass in the accursed thing : for achan , the son of carmi , the son of zabdi , the son of zerah , of the tribe of judah , take of the accursed thing : and the anger of the lord be kindle against the child of israel .
and joshua send man from jericho to ai , which be beside bethaven , on the east side of bethel , and spake unto they , say , go up and view the country .
and the man go up and view ai .
and they return to joshua , and say unto he , let not all the people go up ; but let about two or three thousand man go up and smite aus ; and make not all the people to labour thither ; for they be but few .
so there go up thither of the people about three thousand man : and they flee before the man of ai .
and the man of aus smote of they about thirty and six man : for they chase they from before the gate even unto shebarim , and smite they in the go down : wherefore the heart of the people melt , and become as water .
and joshua rent he clothes , and fall to the earth upon he face before the ark of the lord until the eventide , he and the elder of israel , and put dust upon they head .
and joshua say , alas , o lord god , wherefore hast thou at all bring this people over jordan , to deliver we into the hand of the amorites , to destroy we ? would to god we have be content , and dwelt on the other side jordan !
o lord , what shall i say , when israel turneth they back before they enemy !
for the canaanites and all the inhabitant of the land shall hear of it , and shall environ we round , and cut off we name from the earth : and what wilt thou do unto thy great name ?
and the lord say unto joshua , get thee up ; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face ?
israel have sin , and they have also transgress my covenant which i command they : for they have even take of the accursed thing , and have also steal , and dissemble also , and they have put it even among they own stuff .
therefore the child of israel could not stand before they enemy , but turn they back before they enemy , because they be accurse : neither will i be with you any more , except ye destroy the accurse from among you .
up , sanctify the people , and say , sanctify yourselve against to morrow : for thus saith the lord god of israel , there be a accursed thing in the midst of thee , o israel : thou canst not stand before thine enemy , until ye take away the accursed thing from among you .
in the morning therefore ye shall be bring accord to you tribe : and it shall be , that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come accord to the family thereof ; and the family which the lord shall take shall come by household ; and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man .
and it shall be , that he that be take with the accursed thing shall be burn with fire , he and all that he have : because he have transgress the covenant of the lord , and because he have work folly in israel .
so joshua rise up early in the morning , and bring israel by they tribe ; and the tribe of judah be take :
and he bring the family of judah ; and he take the family of the zarhites : and he bring the family of the zarhites man by man ; and zabdi be take :
and he bring he household man by man ; and achan , the son of carmi , the son of zabdi , the son of zerah , of the tribe of judah , be take .
and joshua say unto achan , my son , give , i pray thee , glory to the lord god of israel , and make confession unto he ; and tell i now what thou hast do ; hide it not from i .
and achan answer joshua , and say , indeed i have sin against the lord god of israel , and thus and thus have i do :
when i see among the spoil a goodly babylonish garment , and two hundred shekel of silver , and a wedge of gold of fifty shekel weight , then i covet they , and take they ; and , behold , they be hide in the earth in the midst of my tent , and the silver under it .
so joshua send messenger , and they run unto the tent ; and , behold , it be hide in he tent , and the silver under it .
and they take they out of the midst of the tent , and bring they unto joshua , and unto all the child of israel , and lay they out before the lord .
and joshua , and all israel with he , take achan the son of zerah , and the silver , and the garment , and the wedge of gold , and he son , and he daughter , and he ox , and he ass , and he sheep , and he tent , and all that he have : and they bring they unto the valley of achor .
and joshua say , why hast thou trouble we ? the lord shall trouble thee this day .
and all israel stone he with stone , and burn they with fire , after they have stone they with stone .
and they raise over he a great heap of stone unto this day .
so the lord turn from the fierceness of he anger .
wherefore the name of that place be call , the valley of achor , unto this day .
and the lord say unto joshua , fear not , neither be thou dismayed : take all the people of war with thee , and arise , go up to ai : see , i have give into thy hand the king of ai , and he people , and he city , and he land :
and thou shalt do to ai and she king as thou didst unto jericho and she king : only the spoil thereof , and the cattle thereof , shall ye take for a prey unto yourselve : lay thee a ambush for the city behind it .
so joshua arise , and all the people of war , to go up against ai : and joshua choose out thirty thousand mighty man of valour , and send they away by night .
and he command they , say , behold , ye shall lie in wait against the city , even behind the city : go not very far from the city , but be ye all ready :
and i , and all the people that be with i , will approach unto the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against we , as at the first , that we will flee before they ,
( for they will come out after we ) till we have draw they from the city ; for they will say , they flee before we , as at the first : therefore we will flee before they .
then ye shall rise up from the ambush , and seize upon the city : for the lord you god will deliver it into you hand .
and it shall be , when ye have take the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : accord to the commandment of the lord shall ye do .
see , i have command you .
joshua therefore send they forth : and they go to lie in ambush , and abode between bethel and ai , on the west side of ai : but joshua lodge that night among the people .
and joshua rise up early in the morning , and number the people , and go up , he and the elder of israel , before the people to ai .
and all the people , even the people of war that be with he , go up , and draw nigh , and come before the city , and pitch on the north side of ai : now there be a valley between they and ai .
and he take about five thousand man , and set they to lie in ambush between bethel and ai , on the west side of the city .
and when they have set the people , even all the host that be on the north of the city , and they lier in wait on the west of the city , joshua go that night into the midst of the valley .
and it come to pass , when the king of ai see it , that they hast and rise up early , and the man of the city go out against israel to battle , he and all he people , at a time appoint , before the plain ; but he wist not that there be lier in ambush against he behind the city .
and joshua and all israel make as if they be beat before they , and flee by the way of the wilderness .
and all the people that be in ai be call together to pursue after they : and they pursue after joshua , and be draw away from the city .
and there be not a man leave in ai or bethel , that go not out after israel : and they leave the city open , and pursue after israel .
and the lord say unto joshua , stretch out the spear that be in thy hand toward ai ; for i will give it into thine hand .
and joshua stretch out the spear that he have in he hand toward the city .
and the ambush arise quickly out of they place , and they run as soon as he have stretch out he hand : and they enter into the city , and take it , and hast and set the city on fire .
and when the man of aus look behind they , they see , and , behold , the smoke of the city ascend up to heaven , and they have no power to flee this way or that way : and the people that flee to the wilderness turn back upon the pursuer .
and when joshua and all israel see that the ambush have take the city , and that the smoke of the city ascend , then they turn again , and slew the man of ai .
and the other issue out of the city against they ; so they be in the midst of israel , some on this side , and some on that side : and they smite they , so that they let none of they remain or escape .
and the king of ai they take alive , and bring he to joshua .
and it come to pass , when israel have make a end of slaying all the inhabitant of ai in the field , in the wilderness wherein they chase they , and when they be all fall on the edge of the sword , until they be consume , that all the israelites return unto ai , and smite it with the edge of the sword .
and so it be , that all that fall that day , both of man and woman , be twelve thousand , even all the man of ai .
for joshua draw not he hand back , wherewith he stretch out the spear , until he have utterly destroy all the inhabitant of ai .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel take for a prey unto themselves , accord unto the word of the lord which he command joshua .
and joshua burnt ai , and make it a heap for ever , even a desolation unto this day .
and the king of ai he hang on a tree until eventide : and as soon as the sun be down , joshua command that they should take he carcase down from the tree , and cast it at the enter of the gate of the city , and raise thereon a great heap of stone , that remaineth unto this day .
then joshua build a altar unto the lord god of israel in mount ebal ,
as moses the servant of the lord command the child of israel , as it be write in the book of the law of moses , a altar of whole stone , over which no man have lift up any iron : and they offer thereon burnt offering unto the lord , and sacrifice peace offering .
and he write there upon the stone a copy of the law of moses , which he write in the presence of the child of israel .
and all israel , and they elder , and officer , and they judge , stand on this side the ark and on that side before the priest the levites , which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord , as well the stranger , as he that be bear among they ; half of they over against mount gerizim , and half of they over against mount ebal ; as moses the servant of the lord have command before , that they should bless the people of israel .
and afterward he read all the word of the law , the blessing and cursing , accord to all that be write in the book of the law .
there be not a word of all that moses command , which joshua read not before all the congregation of israel , with the woman , and the little one , and the stranger that be conversant among they .
and it come to pass , when all the king which be on this side jordan , in the hill , and in the valley , and in all the coast of the great sea over against lebanon , the hittite , and the amorite , the canaanite , the perizzite , the hivite , and the jebusite , hear thereof ;
that they gather themselves together , to fight with joshua and with israel , with one accord .
and when the inhabitant of gibeon hear what joshua have do unto jericho and to ai ,
they do work wilily , and go and make as if they have be ambassador , and take old sack upon they ass , and wine bottle , old , and rent , and bind up ;
and old shoe and clout upon they foot , and old garment upon they ; and all the bread of they provision be dry and mouldy .
and they go to joshua unto the camp at gilgal , and say unto he , and to the man of israel , we be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with we .
and the man of israel say unto the hivites , peradventure ye dwell among we ; and how shall we make a league with you ?
and they say unto joshua , we be thy servant .
and joshua say unto they , who be ye ? and from whence come ye ?
and they say unto he , from a very far country thy servant be come because of the name of the lord thy god : for we have hear the fame of he , and all that he do in egypt ,
and all that he do to the two king of the amorites , that be beyond jordan , to sihon king of heshbon , and to og king of bashan , which be at ashtaroth .
wherefore we elder and all the inhabitant of we country speak to we , say , take victuals with you for the journey , and go to meet they , and say unto they , we be you servant : therefore now make ye a league with we .
this we bread we take hot for we provision out of we house on the day we come forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it be dry , and it be mouldy :
and these bottle of wine , which we fill , be new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these we garment and we shoe be become old by reason of the very long journey .
and the man take of they victuals , and ask not counsel at the mouth of the lord .
and joshua make peace with they , and make a league with they , to let they live : and the prince of the congregation sware unto they .
and it come to pass at the end of three day after they have make a league with they , that they hear that they be they neighbour , and that they dwell among they .
and the child of israel journey , and come unto they city on the third day .
now they city be gibeon , and chephirah , and beeroth , and kirjathjearim .
and the child of israel smite they not , because the prince of the congregation have swear unto they by the lord god of israel .
and all the congregation murmur against the prince .
but all the prince say unto all the congregation , we have swear unto they by the lord god of israel : now therefore we may not touch they .
this we will do to they ; we will even let they live , lest wrath be upon we , because of the oath which we sware unto they .
and the prince say unto they , let they live ; but let they be hewer of wood and drawer of water unto all the congregation ; as the prince have promise they .
and joshua call for they , and he speak unto they , say , wherefore have ye beguile we , say , we be very far from you ; when ye dwell among we ?
now therefore ye be curse , and there shall none of you be free from be bondman , and hewer of wood and drawer of water for the house of my god .
and they answer joshua , and say , because it be certainly tell thy servant , how that the lord thy god command he servant mose to give you all the land , and to destroy all the inhabitant of the land from before you , therefore we be sore afraid of we life because of you , and have do this thing .
and now , behold , we be in thine hand : as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto we , do .
and so do he unto they , and deliver they out of the hand of the child of israel , that they slew they not .
and joshua make they that day hewer of wood and drawer of water for the congregation , and for the altar of the lord , even unto this day , in the place which he should choose .
now it come to pass , when adonizedec king of jerusalem have hear how joshua have take ai , and have utterly destroy it ; as he have do to jericho and she king , so he have do to ai and she king ; and how the inhabitant of gibeon have make peace with israel , and be among they ;
that they fear greatly , because gibeon be a great city , as one of the royal city , and because it be greater than ai , and all the man thereof be mighty .
wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem send unto hoham king of hebron , and unto piram king of jarmuth , and unto japhia king of lachish , and unto debir king of eglon , say ,
come up unto i , and help i , that we may smite gibeon : for it have make peace with joshua and with the child of israel .
therefore the five king of the amorites , the king of jerusalem , the king of hebron , the king of jarmuth , the king of lachish , the king of eglon , gather themselves together , and go up , they and all they host , and encamp before gibeon , and make war against it .
and the man of gibeon send unto joshua to the camp to gilgal , say , slack not thy hand from thy servant ; come up to we quickly , and save we , and help we : for all the king of the amorite that dwell in the mountain be gather together against we .
so joshua ascend from gilgal , he , and all the people of war with he , and all the mighty man of valour .
and the lord say unto joshua , fear they not : for i have deliver they into thine hand ; there shall not a man of they stand before thee .
joshua therefore come unto they suddenly , and go up from gilgal all night .
and the lord discomfited they before israel , and slew they with a great slaughter at gibeon , and chase they along the way that goeth up to bethhoron , and smite they to azekah , and unto makkedah .
and it come to pass , as they flee from before israel , and be in the go down to bethhoron , that the lord cast down great stone from heaven upon they unto azekah , and they die : they be more which die with hailstone than they whom the child of israel slew with the sword .
then speak joshua to the lord in the day when the lord deliver up the amorites before the child of israel , and he say in the sight of israel , sun , stand thou still upon gibeon ; and thou , moon , in the valley of ajalon .
and the sun stand still , and the moon stay , until the people have avenge themselves upon they enemy .
be not this write in the book of jasher ?
so the sun stand still in the midst of heaven , and hast not to go down about a whole day .
and there be no day like that before it or after it , that the lord hearken unto the voice of a man : for the lord fight for israel .
and joshua return , and all israel with he , unto the camp to gilgal .
but these five king flee , and hide themselves in a cave at makkedah .
and it be tell joshua , say , the five king be find hide in a cave at makkedah .
and joshua say , roll great stone upon the mouth of the cave , and set man by it for to keep they :
and stay ye not , but pursue after you enemy , and smite the hindmost of they ; suffer they not to enter into they city : for the lord you god have deliver they into you hand .
and it come to pass , when joshua and the child of israel have make a end of slaying they with a very great slaughter , till they be consume , that the rest which remain of they enter into fenced city .
and all the people return to the camp to joshua at makkedah in peace : none move he tongue against any of the child of israel .
then say joshua , open the mouth of the cave , and bring out those five king unto i out of the cave .
and they do so , and bring forth those five king unto he out of the cave , the king of jerusalem , the king of hebron , the king of jarmuth , the king of lachish , and the king of eglon .
and it come to pass , when they bring out those king unto joshua , that joshua call for all the man of israel , and say unto the captain of the man of war which go with he , come near , put you foot upon the neck of these king .
and they come near , and put they foot upon the neck of they .
and joshua say unto they , fear not , nor be dismayed , be strong and of good courage : for thus shall the lord do to all you enemy against whom ye fight .
and afterward joshua smite they , and slew they , and hang they on five tree : and they be hang upon the tree until the evening .
and it come to pass at the time of the go down of the sun , that joshua command , and they take they down off the tree , and cast they into the cave wherein they have be hide , and lay great stone in the cave 's mouth , which remain until this very day .
and that day joshua take makkedah , and smite it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof he utterly destroy , they , and all the soul that be therein ; he let none remain : and he do to the king of makkedah as he do unto the king of jericho .
then joshua pass from makkedah , and all israel with he , unto libnah , and fight against libnah :
and the lord deliver it also , and the king thereof , into the hand of israel ; and he smite it with the edge of the sword , and all the soul that be therein ; he let none remain in it ; but do unto the king thereof as he do unto the king of jericho .
and joshua pass from libnah , and all israel with he , unto lachish , and encamp against it , and fight against it :
and the lord deliver lachish into the hand of israel , which take it on the second day , and smite it with the edge of the sword , and all the soul that be therein , accord to all that he have do to libnah .
then horam king of gezer come up to help lachish ; and joshua smite he and he people , until he have leave he none remain .
and from lachish joshua pass unto eglon , and all israel with he ; and they encamp against it , and fight against it :
and they take it on that day , and smite it with the edge of the sword , and all the soul that be therein he utterly destroy that day , accord to all that he have do to lachish .
and joshua go up from eglon , and all israel with he , unto hebron ; and they fight against it :
and they take it , and smite it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof , and all the city thereof , and all the soul that be therein ; he leave none remain , accord to all that he have do to eglon ; but destroy it utterly , and all the soul that be therein .
and joshua return , and all israel with he , to debir ; and fight against it :
and he take it , and the king thereof , and all the city thereof ; and they smite they with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroy all the soul that be therein ; he leave none remain : as he have do to hebron , so he do to debir , and to the king thereof ; as he have do also to libnah , and to she king .
so joshua smite all the country of the hill , and of the south , and of the vale , and of the spring , and all they king : he leave none remain , but utterly destroy all that breathe , as the lord god of israel command .
and joshua smite they from kadeshbarnea even unto gaza , and all the country of goshen , even unto gibeon .
and all these king and they land do joshua take at one time , because the lord god of israel fight for israel .
and joshua return , and all israel with he , unto the camp to gilgal .
and it come to pass , when jabin king of hazor have hear those thing , that he send to jobab king of madon , and to the king of shimron , and to the king of achshaph ,
and to the king that be on the north of the mountain , and of the plain south of chinneroth , and in the valley , and in the border of dor on the west ,
and to the canaanite on the east and on the west , and to the amorite , and the hittite , and the perizzite , and the jebusite in the mountain , and to the hivite under hermon in the land of mizpeh .
and they go out , they and all they host with they , much people , even as the sand that be upon the sea shore in multitude , with horse and chariot very many .
and when all these king be meet together , they come and pitch together at the water of merom , to fight against israel .
and the lord say unto joshua , be not afraid because of they : for to morrow about this time will i deliver they up all slay before israel : thou shalt hough they horse , and burn they chariot with fire .
so joshua come , and all the people of war with he , against they by the water of merom suddenly ; and they fall upon they .
and the lord deliver they into the hand of israel , who smite they , and chase they unto great zidon , and unto misrephothmaim , and unto the valley of mizpeh eastward ; and they smite they , until they leave they none remain .
and joshua do unto they as the lord bid he : he hough they horse , and burn they chariot with fire .
and joshua at that time turn back , and take hazor , and smite the king thereof with the sword : for hazor beforetime be the head of all those kingdom .
and they smite all the soul that be therein with the edge of the sword , utterly destroy they : there be not any leave to breathe : and he burn hazor with fire .
and all the city of those king , and all the king of they , do joshua take , and smite they with the edge of the sword , and he utterly destroy they , as moses the servant of the lord command .
but as for the city that stand still in they strength , israel burn none of they , save hazor only ; that do joshua burn .
and all the spoil of these city , and the cattle , the child of israel take for a prey unto themselves ; but every man they smite with the edge of the sword , until they have destroy they , neither leave they any to breathe .
as the lord command mose he servant , so do moses command joshua , and so do joshua ; he leave nothing undo of all that the lord command moses .
so joshua take all that land , the hill , and all the south country , and all the land of goshen , and the valley , and the plain , and the mountain of israel , and the valley of the same ;
even from the mount halak , that goeth up to seir , even unto baalgad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon : and all they king he take , and smite they , and slew they .
joshua make war a long time with all those king .
there be not a city that make peace with the child of israel , save the hivites the inhabitant of gibeon : all other they take in battle .
for it be of the lord to harden they heart , that they should come against israel in battle , that he might destroy they utterly , and that they might have no favour , but that he might destroy they , as the lord command moses .
and at that time come joshua , and cut off the anakims from the mountain , from hebron , from debir , from anab , and from all the mountain of judah , and from all the mountain of israel : joshua destroy they utterly with they city .
there be none of the anakims leave in the land of the child of israel : only in gaza , in gath , and in ashdod , there remain .
so joshua take the whole land , accord to all that the lord say unto mose ; and joshua give it for a inheritance unto israel accord to they division by they tribe .
and the land rest from war .
now these be the king of the land , which the child of israel smite , and possess they land on the other side jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river arnon unto mount hermon , and all the plain on the east :
sihon king of the amorites , who dwell in heshbon , and rule from aroer , which be upon the bank of the river arnon , and from the middle of the river , and from half gilead , even unto the river jabbok , which be the border of the child of ammon ;

now joshua be old and stricken in year ; and the lord say unto he , thou art old and stricken in year , and there remaineth yet very much land to be possess .
this be the land that yet remaineth : all the border of the philistines , and all geshuri ,
from sihor , which be before egypt , even unto the border of ekron northward , which be count to the canaanite : five lord of the philistines ; the gazathites , and the ashdothites , the eshkalonites , the gittites , and the ekronites ; also the avites :

all the inhabitant of the hill country from lebanon unto misrephothmaim , and all the sidonians , they will i drive out from before the child of israel : only divide thou it by lot unto the israelites for a inheritance , as i have command thee .
now therefore divide this land for a inheritance unto the nine tribe , and the half tribe of manasseh ,
with whom the reubenites and the gadites have receive they inheritance , which mose give they , beyond jordan eastward , even as moses the servant of the lord give they ;
from aroer , that be upon the bank of the river arnon , and the city that be in the midst of the river , and all the plain of medeba unto dibon ;

and gilead , and the border of the geshurites and maachathites , and all mount hermon , and all bashan unto salcah ;
all the kingdom of og in bashan , which reign in ashtaroth and in edrei , who remain of the remnant of the giant : for these do moses smite , and cast they out .
nevertheless the child of israel expel not the geshurites , nor the maachathites : but the geshurites and the maachathites dwell among the israelites until this day .
only unto the tribe of levi he give none inheritance ; the sacrifice of the lord god of israel make by fire be they inheritance , as he say unto they .
and moses give unto the tribe of the child of reuben inheritance accord to they family .
and they coast be from aroer , that be on the bank of the river arnon , and the city that be in the midst of the river , and all the plain by medeba ;

and the border of the child of reuben be jordan , and the border thereof .

and these be the country which the child of israel inherit in the land of canaan , which eleazar the priest , and joshua the son of nun , and the head of the father of the tribe of the child of israel , distribute for inheritance to they .
by lot be they inheritance , as the lord command by the hand of moses , for the nine tribe , and for the half tribe .
for mose have give the inheritance of two tribe and a half tribe on the other side jordan : but unto the levites he give none inheritance among they .

as the lord command moses , so the child of israel do , and they divide the land .
then the child of judah come unto joshua in gilgal : and caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite say unto he , thou knowest the thing that the lord say unto mose the man of god concern i and thee in kadeshbarnea .
forty year old be i when mose the servant of the lord send i from kadeshbarnea to espy out the land ; and i bring he word again as it be in mine heart .

as yet i be as strong this day as i be in the day that moses send i : as my strength be then , even so be my strength now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
now therefore give i this mountain , whereof the lord spake in that day ; for thou heardest in that day how the anakims be there , and that the city be great and fenced : if so be the lord will be with i , then i shall be able to drive they out , as the lord say .
and joshua bless he , and give unto caleb the son of jephunneh hebron for a inheritance .

be the iniquity of peor too little for we , from which we be not cleanse until this day , although there be a plague in the congregation of the lord ,
but that ye must turn away this day from follow the lord ? and it will be , see ye rebel to day against the lord , that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of israel .
notwithstanding , if the land of you possession be unclean , then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the lord , wherein the lord 's tabernacle dwelleth , and take possession among we : but rebel not against the lord , nor rebel against we , in build you a altar beside the altar of the lord we god .

that we have build we a altar to turn from follow the lord , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offering thereon , let the lord himself require it ;
and if we have not rather do it for fear of this thing , say , in time to come you child might speak unto we child , say , what have ye to do with the lord god of israel ?
for the lord have make jordan a border between we and you , ye child of reuben and child of gad ; ye have no part in the lord : so shall you child make we child cease from fear the lord .

and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest , and the prince , return from the child of reuben , and from the child of gad , out of the land of gilead , unto the land of canaan , to the child of israel , and bring they word again .
and the thing please the child of israel ; and the child of israel bless god , and do not intend to go up against they in battle , to destroy the land wherein the child of reuben and gad dwelt .

behold , i have divide unto you by lot these nation that remain , to be a inheritance for you tribe , from jordan , with all the nation that i have cut off , even unto the great sea westward .
and the lord you god , he shall expel they from before you , and drive they from out of you sight ; and ye shall possess they land , as the lord you god have promise unto you .
be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that be write in the book of the law of moses , that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the leave ;
that ye come not among these nation , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of they god , nor cause to swear by they , neither serve they , nor bow yourselve unto they :
but cleave unto the lord you god , as ye have do unto this day .
for the lord have drive out from before you great nation and strong : but as for you , no man have be able to stand before you unto this day .
one man of you shall chase a thousand : for the lord you god , he it be that fighteth for you , as he have promise you .
take good heed therefore unto yourselve , that ye love the lord you god .
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cleave unto the remnant of these nation , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriage with they , and go in unto they , and they to you :
know for a certainty that the lord you god will no more drive out any of these nation from before you ; but they shall be snare and trap unto you , and scourge in you side , and thorn in you eye , until ye perish from off this good land which the lord you god have give you .
and , behold , this day i be go the way of all the earth : and ye know in all you heart and in all you soul , that not one thing have fail of all the good thing which the lord you god spake concern you ; all be come to pass unto you , and not one thing have fail thereof .
therefore it shall come to pass , that as all good thing be come upon you , which the lord you god promise you ; so shall the lord bring upon you all evil thing , until he have destroy you from off this good land which the lord you god have give you .
when ye have transgress the covenant of the lord you god , which he command you , and have go and serve other god , and bow yourselve to they ; then shall the anger of the lord be kindle against you , and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he have give unto you .
and joshua gather all the tribe of israel to shechem , and call for the elder of israel , and for they head , and for they judge , and for they officer ; and they present themselves before god .
and joshua say unto all the people , thus saith the lord god of israel , you father dwell on the other side of the flood in old time , even terah , the father of abraham , and the father of nachor : and they serve other god .
and i take you father abraham from the other side of the flood , and lead he throughout all the land of canaan , and multiply he seed , and give he isaac .
and i give unto isaac jacob and esau : and i give unto esau mount seir , to possess it ; but jacob and he child go down into egypt .
i send moses also and aaron , and i plague egypt , accord to that which i do among they : and afterward i bring you out .
and i bring you father out of egypt : and ye come unto the sea ; and the egyptians pursue after you father with chariot and horseman unto the red sea .
and when they cry unto the lord , he put darkness between you and the egyptians , and bring the sea upon they , and cover they ; and you eye have see what i have do in egypt : and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season .
and i bring you into the land of the amorites , which dwell on the other side jordan ; and they fight with you : and i give they into you hand , that ye might possess they land ; and i destroy they from before you .
then balak the son of zippor , king of moab , arise and war against israel , and send and call balaam the son of beor to curse you :
but i would not hearken unto balaam ; therefore he bless you still : so i deliver you out of he hand .
and ye go over jordan , and come unto jericho : and the man of jericho fight against you , the amorites , and the perizzites , and the canaanites , and the hittites , and the girgashites , the hivites , and the jebusites ; and i deliver they into you hand .
and i send the hornet before you , which drave they out from before you , even the two king of the amorites ; but not with thy sword , nor with thy bow .
and i have give you a land for which ye do not labour , and city which ye build not , and ye dwell in they ; of the vineyard and oliveyard which ye plant not do ye eat .
now therefore fear the lord , and serve he in sincerity and in truth : and put away the god which you father serve on the other side of the flood , and in egypt ; and serve ye the lord .
and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord , choose you this day whom ye will serve ; whether the god which you father serve that be on the other side of the flood , or the god of the amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but as for i and my house , we will serve the lord .
and the people answer and say , god forbid that we should forsake the lord , to serve other god ;
for the lord we god , he it be that bring we up and we father out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage , and which do those great sign in we sight , and preserve we in all the way wherein we go , and among all the people through whom we pass :
and the lord drave out from before we all the people , even the amorite which dwell in the land : therefore will we also serve the lord ; for he be we god .
and joshua say unto the people , ye can not serve the lord : for he be a holy god ; he be a jealous god ; he will not forgive you transgression nor you sin .
if ye forsake the lord , and serve strange god , then he will turn and do you hurt , and consume you , after that he have do you good .
and the people say unto joshua , nay ; but we will serve the lord .
and joshua say unto the people , ye be witness against yourselve that ye have choose you the lord , to serve he .
and they say , we be witness .
now therefore put away , say he , the strange god which be among you , and incline you heart unto the lord god of israel .
and the people say unto joshua , the lord we god will we serve , and he voice will we obey .
so joshua make a covenant with the people that day , and set they a statute and a ordinance in shechem .
and joshua write these word in the book of the law of god , and take a great stone , and set it up there under a oak , that be by the sanctuary of the lord .
and joshua say unto all the people , behold , this stone shall be a witness unto we ; for it have hear all the word of the lord which he speak unto we : it shall be therefore a witness unto you , lest ye deny you god .
so joshua let the people depart , every man unto he inheritance .
and it come to pass after these thing , that joshua the son of nun , the servant of the lord , die , be a hundred and ten year old .
and they bury he in the border of he inheritance in timnathserah , which be in mount ephraim , on the north side of the hill of gaash .
and israel serve the lord all the day of joshua , and all the day of the elder that overlive joshua , and which have know all the work of the lord , that he have do for israel .
and the bone of joseph , which the child of israel bring up out of egypt , bury they in shechem , in a parcel of ground which jacob buy of the son of hamor the father of shechem for a hundred piece of silver : and it become the inheritance of the child of joseph .
and eleazar the son of aaron die ; and they bury he in a hill that pertain to phinehas he son , which be give he in mount ephraim .
now after the death of joshua it come to pass , that the child of israel ask the lord , say , who shall go up for we against the canaanites first , to fight against they ?
and the lord say , judah shall go up : behold , i have deliver the land into he hand .
and judah say unto simeon he brother , come up with i into my lot , that we may fight against the canaanites ; and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot .
so simeon go with he .
and judah go up ; and the lord deliver the canaanites and the perizzites into they hand : and they slew of they in bezek ten thousand man .
and they find adonibezek in bezek : and they fight against he , and they slew the canaanites and the perizzites .
but adonibezek flee ; and they pursue after he , and catch he , and cut off he thumb and he great toe .
and adonibezek say , threescore and ten king , have they thumb and they great toe cut off , gather they meat under my table : as i have do , so god have requite i .
and they bring he to jerusalem , and there he die .
now the child of judah have fight against jerusalem , and have take it , and smite it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
and afterward the child of judah go down to fight against the canaanites , that dwelt in the mountain , and in the south , and in the valley .
and judah go against the canaanites that dwell in hebron : ( now the name of hebron before be kirjatharba : ) and they slew sheshai , and ahiman , and talmai .
and from thence he go against the inhabitant of debir : and the name of debir before be kirjathsepher :
and caleb say , he that smiteth kirjathsepher , and taketh it , to he will i give achsah my daughter to wife .
and othniel the son of kenaz , caleb 's younger brother , take it : and he give he achsah he daughter to wife .
and it come to pass , when she come to he , that she move he to ask of she father a field : and she light from off she ass ; and caleb say unto she , what wilt thou ?
and she say unto he , give i a blessing : for thou hast give i a south land ; give i also spring of water .
and caleb give she the upper spring and the nether spring .
and the child of the kenite , moses ' father in law , go up out of the city of palm tree with the child of judah into the wilderness of judah , which lieth in the south of arad ; and they go and dwelt among the people .
and judah go with simeon he brother , and they slew the canaanites that inhabit zephath , and utterly destroy it .
and the name of the city be call hormah .
also judah take gaza with the coast thereof , and askelon with the coast thereof , and ekron with the coast thereof .
and the lord be with judah ; and he drave out the inhabitant of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitant of the valley , because they have chariot of iron .
and they give hebron unto caleb , as moses say : and he expel thence the three son of anak .
and the child of benjamin do not drive out the jebusites that inhabit jerusalem ; but the jebusites dwell with the child of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day .
and the house of joseph , they also go up against bethel : and the lord be with they .
and the house of joseph send to descry bethel .
( now the name of the city before be luz . )
and the spy see a man come forth out of the city , and they say unto he , shew we , we pray thee , the entrance into the city , and we will shew thee mercy .
and when he shew they the entrance into the city , they smite the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let go the man and all he family .
and the man go into the land of the hittites , and build a city , and call the name thereof luz : which be the name thereof unto this day .
neither do manasseh drive out the inhabitant of bethshean and she town , nor taanach and she town , nor the inhabitant of dor and she town , nor the inhabitant of ibleam and she town , nor the inhabitant of megiddo and she town : but the canaanites would dwell in that land .
and it come to pass , when israel be strong , that they put the canaanites to tribute , and do not utterly drive they out .
neither do ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwell in gezer ; but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among they .
neither do zebulun drive out the inhabitant of kitron , nor the inhabitant of nahalol ; but the canaanites dwelt among they , and become tributary .
neither do asher drive out the inhabitant of accho , nor the inhabitant of zidon , nor of ahlab , nor of achzib , nor of helbah , nor of aphik , nor of rehob :
but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites , the inhabitant of the land : for they do not drive they out .
neither do naphtali drive out the inhabitant of bethshemesh , nor the inhabitant of bethanath ; but he dwell among the canaanites , the inhabitant of the land : nevertheless the inhabitant of bethshemesh and of bethanath become tributary unto they .
and the amorites force the child of dan into the mountain : for they would not suffer they to come down to the valley :
but the amorites would dwell in mount heres in aijalon , and in shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of joseph prevail , so that they become tributary .
and the coast of the amorites be from the go up to akrabbim , from the rock , and upward .
and a angel of the lord come up from gilgal to bochim , and say , i make you to go up out of egypt , and have bring you unto the land which i sware unto you father ; and i say , i will never break my covenant with you .
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitant of this land ; ye shall throw down they altar : but ye have not obey my voice : why have ye do this ?
wherefore i also say , i will not drive they out from before you ; but they shall be as thorn in you side , and they god shall be a snare unto you .
and it come to pass , when the angel of the lord speak these word unto all the child of israel , that the people lift up they voice , and weep .
and they call the name of that place bochim : and they sacrifice there unto the lord .
and when joshua have let the people go , the child of israel go every man unto he inheritance to possess the land .
and the people serve the lord all the day of joshua , and all the day of the elder that outlive joshua , who have see all the great work of the lord , that he do for israel .
and joshua the son of nun , the servant of the lord , die , be a hundred and ten year old .
and they bury he in the border of he inheritance in timnathheres , in the mount of ephraim , on the north side of the hill gaash .
and also all that generation be gather unto they father : and there arise another generation after they , which know not the lord , nor yet the work which he have do for israel .
and the child of israel do evil in the sight of the lord , and serve baalim :
and they forsake the lord god of they father , which bring they out of the land of egypt , and follow other god , of the god of the people that be round about they , and bow themselves unto they , and provoke the lord to anger .
and they forsake the lord , and serve baal and ashtaroth .
and the anger of the lord be hot against israel , and he deliver they into the hand of spoiler that spoil they , and he sell they into the hand of they enemy round about , so that they could not any longer stand before they enemy .
whithersoever they go out , the hand of the lord be against they for evil , as the lord have say , and as the lord have swear unto they : and they be greatly distressed .
nevertheless the lord raise up judge , which deliver they out of the hand of those that spoil they .
and yet they would not hearken unto they judge , but they go a whoring after other god , and bow themselves unto they : they turn quickly out of the way which they father walk in , obey the commandment of the lord ; but they do not so .
and when the lord raise they up judge , then the lord be with the judge , and deliver they out of the hand of they enemy all the day of the judge : for it repent the lord because of they groaning by reason of they that oppress they and vex they .
and it come to pass , when the judge be dead , that they return , and corrupt themselves more than they father , in follow other god to serve they , and to bow down unto they ; they cease not from they own doings , nor from they stubborn way .
and the anger of the lord be hot against israel ; and he say , because that this people have transgress my covenant which i command they father , and have not hearken unto my voice ;
i also will not henceforth drive out any from before they of the nation which joshua leave when he die :
that through they i may prove israel , whether they will keep the way of the lord to walk therein , as they father do keep it , or not .
therefore the lord leave those nation , without drive they out hastily ; neither deliver he they into the hand of joshua .
now these be the nation which the lord leave , to prove israel by they , even as many of israel as have not know all the war of canaan ;
only that the generation of the child of israel might know , to teach they war , at the least such as before know nothing thereof ;
namely , five lord of the philistines , and all the canaanites , and the sidonians , and the hivite that dwell in mount lebanon , from mount baalhermon unto the enter in of hamath .
and they be to prove israel by they , to know whether they would hearken unto the commandment of the lord , which he command they father by the hand of moses .
and the child of israel dwelt among the canaanites , hittites , and amorites , and perizzites , and hivites , and jebusites :
and they take they daughter to be they wife , and give they daughter to they son , and serve they god .
and the child of israel do evil in the sight of the lord , and forgat the lord they god , and serve baalim and the grove .
therefore the anger of the lord be hot against israel , and he sell they into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia : and the child of israel serve chushanrishathaim eight year .
and when the child of israel cry unto the lord , the lord raise up a deliverer to the child of israel , who deliver they , even othniel the son of kenaz , caleb 's younger brother .
and the spirit of the lord come upon he , and he judge israel , and go out to war : and the lord deliver chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia into he hand ; and he hand prevail against chushanrishathaim .
and the land have rest forty year .
and othniel the son of kenaz die .
and the child of israel do evil again in the sight of the lord : and the lord strengthen eglon the king of moab against israel , because they have do evil in the sight of the lord .
and he gather unto he the child of ammon and amalek , and go and smite israel , and possess the city of palm tree .
so the child of israel serve eglon the king of moab eighteen year .
but when the child of israel cry unto the lord , the lord raise they up a deliverer , ehud the son of gera , a benjamite , a man lefthand : and by he the child of israel send a present unto eglon the king of moab .
but ehud make he a dagger which have two edge , of a cubit length ; and he do gird it under he raiment upon he right thigh .
and he bring the present unto eglon king of moab : and eglon be a very fat man .
and when he have make a end to offer the present , he send away the people that bare the present .
but he himself turn again from the quarry that be by gilgal , and say , i have a secret errand unto thee , o king : who say , keep silence .
and all that stand by he go out from he .
and ehud come unto he ; and he be sit in a summer parlour , which he have for himself alone .
and ehud say , i have a message from god unto thee .
and he arise out of he seat .
and ehud put forth he left hand , and take the dagger from he right thigh , and thrust it into he belly :
and the haft also go in after the blade ; and the fat close upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of he belly ; and the dirt come out .
then ehud go forth through the porch , and shut the door of the parlour upon he , and lock they .
when he be go out , he servant come ; and when they see that , behold , the door of the parlour be lock , they say , surely he covereth he foot in he summer chamber .
and they tarry till they be ashamed : and , behold , he open not the door of the parlour ; therefore they take a key , and open they : and , behold , they lord be fall down dead on the earth .
and ehud escape while they tarry , and pass beyond the quarry , and escape unto seirath .
and it come to pass , when he be come , that he blow a trumpet in the mountain of ephraim , and the child of israel go down with he from the mount , and he before they .
and he say unto they , follow after i : for the lord have deliver you enemy the moabites into you hand .
and they go down after he , and take the ford of jordan toward moab , and suffer not a man to pass over .
and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand man , all lusty , and all man of valour ; and there escape not a man .
so moab be subdue that day under the hand of israel .
and the land have rest fourscore year .
and after he be shamgar the son of anath , which slew of the philistines six hundred man with a ox goad : and he also deliver israel .
and the child of israel again do evil in the sight of the lord , when ehud be dead .
and the lord sell they into the hand of jabin king of canaan , that reign in hazor ; the captain of whose host be sisera , which dwell in harosheth of the gentiles .
and the child of israel cry unto the lord : for he have nine hundred chariot of iron ; and twenty year he mightily oppress the child of israel .
and deborah , a prophetess , the wife of lapidoth , she judge israel at that time .
and she dwell under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in mount ephraim : and the child of israel come up to she for judgment .
and she send and call barak the son of abinoam out of kedeshnaphtali , and say unto he , hath not the lord god of israel command , say , go and draw toward mount tabor , and take with thee ten thousand man of the child of naphtali and of the child of zebulun ?
and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera , the captain of jabin 's army , with he chariot and he multitude ; and i will deliver he into thine hand .
and barak say unto she , if thou wilt go with i , then i will go : but if thou wilt not go with i , then i will not go .
and she say , i will surely go with thee : notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour ; for the lord shall sell sisera into the hand of a woman .
and deborah arise , and go with barak to kedesh .
and barak call zebulun and naphtali to kedesh ; and he go up with ten thousand man at he foot : and deborah go up with he .
now heber the kenite , which be of the child of hobab the father in law of moses , have sever himself from the kenites , and pitch he tent unto the plain of zaanaim , which be by kedesh .
and they shew sisera that barak the son of abinoam be go up to mount tabor .
and sisera gather together all he chariot , even nine hundred chariot of iron , and all the people that be with he , from harosheth of the gentiles unto the river of kishon .
and deborah say unto barak , up ; for this be the day in which the lord have deliver sisera into thine hand : be not the lord go out before thee ?
so barak go down from mount tabor , and ten thousand man after he .
and the lord discomfited sisera , and all he chariot , and all he host , with the edge of the sword before barak ; so that sisera light down off he chariot , and flee away on he foot .
but barak pursue after the chariot , and after the host , unto harosheth of the gentiles : and all the host of sisera fall upon the edge of the sword ; and there be not a man leave .
howbeit sisera flee away on he foot to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite : for there be peace between jabin the king of hazor and the house of heber the kenite .
and jael go out to meet sisera , and say unto he , turn in , my lord , turn in to i ; fear not .
and when he have turn in unto she into the tent , she cover he with a mantle .
and he say unto she , give i , i pray thee , a little water to drink ; for i be thirsty .
and she open a bottle of milk , and give he drink , and cover he .
again he say unto she , stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man doth come and enquire of thee , and say , be there any man here ? that thou shalt say , no. .
then jael heber 's wife take a nail of the tent , and take a hammer in she hand , and go softly unto he , and smite the nail into he temple , and fasten it into the ground : for he be fast asleep and weary .
so he die .
and , behold , as barak pursue sisera , jael come out to meet he , and say unto he , come , and i will shew thee the man whom thou seekest .
and when he come into she tent , behold , sisera lay dead , and the nail be in he temple .
so god subdue on that day jabin the king of canaan before the child of israel .
and the hand of the child of israel prosper , and prevail against jabin the king of canaan , until they have destroy jabin king of canaan .
then sing deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day , say ,
praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel , when the people willingly offer themselves .
hear , o ye king ; give ear , o ye prince ; i , even i , will sing unto the lord ; i will sing praise to the lord god of israel .
lord , when thou wentest out of seir , when thou marchedst out of the field of edom , the earth tremble , and the heaven drop , the cloud also drop water .
the mountain melt from before the lord , even that sinai from before the lord god of israel .
in the day of shamgar the son of anath , in the day of jael , the highway be unoccupied , and the traveller walk through byway .
the inhabitant of the village cease , they cease in israel , until that i deborah arise , that i arise a mother in israel .
they choose new god ; then be war in the gate : be there a shield or spear see among forty thousand in israel ?
my heart be toward the governor of israel , that offer themselves willingly among the people .
bless ye the lord .
speak , ye that ride on white ass , ye that sit in judgment , and walk by the way .
they that be deliver from the noise of archer in the place of draw water , there shall they rehearse the righteous act of the lord , even the righteous act toward the inhabitant of he village in israel : then shall the people of the lord go down to the gate .
awake , awake , deborah : awake , awake , utter a song : arise , barak , and lead thy captivity captive , thou son of abinoam .
then he make he that remaineth have dominion over the noble among the people : the lord make i have dominion over the mighty .
out of ephraim be there a root of they against amalek ; after thee , benjamin , among thy people ; out of machir come down governor , and out of zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
and the prince of issachar be with deborah ; even issachar , and also barak : he be send on foot into the valley .
for the division of reuben there be great thought of heart .
why abodest thou among the sheepfold , to hear the bleating of the flock ?
for the division of reuben there be great searching of heart .
gilead abode beyond jordan : and why do dan remain in ship ?
asher continue on the sea shore , and abode in he breach .
zebulun and naphtali be a people that jeopard they life unto the death in the high place of the field .
the king come and fight , then fight the king of canaan in taanach by the water of megiddo ; they take no gain of money .
they fight from heaven ; the star in they course fight against sisera .
the river of kishon sweep they away , that ancient river , the river kishon .
o my soul , thou hast trodden down strength .
then be the horsehoof break by the means of the pransing , the pransing of they mighty one .
curse ye meroz , say the angel of the lord , curse ye bitterly the inhabitant thereof ; because they come not to the help of the lord , to the help of the lord against the mighty .
bless above woman shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be , bless shall she be above woman in the tent .
he ask water , and she give he milk ; she bring forth butter in a lordly dish .
she put she hand to the nail , and she right hand to the workman 's hammer ; and with the hammer she smite sisera , she smite off he head , when she have pierce and stricken through he temple .
at she foot he bow , he fall , he lay down : at she foot he bow , he fall : where he bow , there he fall down dead .
the mother of sisera look out at a window , and cry through the lattice , why be he chariot so long in come ? why tarry the wheel of he chariot ?
she wise lady answer she , yea , she return answer to herself ,
have they not speed ? have they not divide the prey ; to every man a damsel or two ; to sisera a prey of diver colour , a prey of diver colour of needlework , of diver colour of needlework on both side , meet for the neck of they that take the spoil ?
so let all thine enemy perish , o lord : but let they that love he be as the sun when he goeth forth in he might .
and the land have rest forty year .
and the child of israel do evil in the sight of the lord : and the lord deliver they into the hand of midian seven year .
and the hand of midian prevail against israel : and because of the midianites the child of israel make they the den which be in the mountain , and cave , and strong hold .
and so it be , when israel have sow , that the midianites come up , and the amalekites , and the child of the east , even they come up against they ;
and they encamp against they , and destroy the increase of the earth , till thou come unto gaza , and leave no sustenance for israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor ass .
for they come up with they cattle and they tent , and they come as grasshopper for multitude ; for both they and they camel be without number : and they enter into the land to destroy it .
and israel be greatly impoverished because of the midianites ; and the child of israel cry unto the lord .
and it come to pass , when the child of israel cry unto the lord because of the midianites ,
that the lord send a prophet unto the child of israel , which say unto they , thus saith the lord god of israel , i bring you up from egypt , and bring you forth out of the house of bondage ;
and i deliver you out of the hand of the egyptians , and out of the hand of all that oppressed you , and drave they out from before you , and give you they land ;
and i say unto you , i be the lord you god ; fear not the god of the amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but ye have not obey my voice .
and there come a angel of the lord , and sit under a oak which be in ophrah , that pertain unto joash the abiezrite : and he son gideon thresh wheat by the winepress , to hide it from the midianites .
and the angel of the lord appear unto he , and say unto he , the lord be with thee , thou mighty man of valour .
and gideon say unto he , oh my lord , if the lord be with we , why then be all this befall we ? and where be all he miracle which we father tell we of , say , do not the lord bring we up from egypt ? but now the lord have forsake we , and deliver we into the hand of the midianites .
and the lord look upon he , and say , go in this thy might , and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites : have not i send thee ?
and he say unto he , oh my lord , wherewith shall i save israel ? behold , my family be poor in manasseh , and i be the least in my father 's house .
and the lord say unto he , surely i will be with thee , and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man .
and he say unto he , if now i have find grace in thy sight , then shew i a sign that thou talkest with i .
depart not hence , i pray thee , until i come unto thee , and bring forth my present , and set it before thee .
and he say , i will tarry until thou come again .
and gideon go in , and make ready a kid , and unleavened cake of a ephah of flour : the flesh he put in a basket , and he put the broth in a pot , and bring it out unto he under the oak , and present it .
and the angel of god say unto he , take the flesh and the unleavened cake , and lay they upon this rock , and pour out the broth .
and he do so .
then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that be in he hand , and touch the flesh and the unleavened cake ; and there rise up fire out of the rock , and consume the flesh and the unleavened cake .
then the angel of the lord depart out of he sight .
and when gideon perceive that he be a angel of the lord , gideon say , alas , o lord god ! for because i have see a angel of the lord face to face .
and the lord say unto he , peace be unto thee ; fear not : thou shalt not die .
then gideon build a altar there unto the lord , and call it jehovahshalom : unto this day it be yet in ophrah of the abiezrites .
and it come to pass the same night , that the lord say unto he , take thy father 's young bullock , even the second bullock of seven year old , and throw down the altar of baal that thy father have , and cut down the grove that be by it :
and build a altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock , in the order place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down .
then gideon take ten man of he servant , and do as the lord have say unto he : and so it be , because he fear he father 's household , and the man of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he do it by night .
and when the man of the city arise early in the morning , behold , the altar of baal be cast down , and the grove be cut down that be by it , and the second bullock be offer upon the altar that be build .
and they say one to another , who have do this thing ?
and when they enquire and ask , they say , gideon the son of joash have do this thing .
then the man of the city say unto joash , bring out thy son , that he may die : because he have cast down the altar of baal , and because he have cut down the grove that be by it .
and joash say unto all that stand against he , will ye plead for baal ? will ye save he ? he that will plead for he , let he be put to death whilst it be yet morning : if he be a god , let he plead for himself , because one have cast down he altar .
therefore on that day he call he jerubbaal , say , let baal plead against he , because he have throw down he altar .
then all the midianites and the amalekites and the child of the east be gather together , and go over , and pitch in the valley of jezreel .
but the spirit of the lord come upon gideon , and he blow a trumpet ; and abiezer be gather after he .
and he send messenger throughout all manasseh ; who also be gather after he : and he send messenger unto asher , and unto zebulun , and unto naphtalus ; and they come up to meet they .
and gideon say unto god , if thou wilt save israel by mine hand , as thou hast say ,
behold , i will put a fleece of wool in the floor ; and if the dew be on the fleece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand , as thou hast say .
and it be so : for he rise up early on the morrow , and thrust the fleece together , and wringe the dew out of the fleece , a bowl full of water .
and gideon say unto god , let not thine anger be hot against i , and i will speak but this once : let i prove , i pray thee , but this once with the fleece ; let it now be dry only upon the fleece , and upon all the ground let there be dew .
and god do so that night : for it be dry upon the fleece only , and there be dew on all the ground .
then jerubbaal , who be gideon , and all the people that be with he , rise up early , and pitch beside the well of harod : so that the host of the midianites be on the north side of they , by the hill of moreh , in the valley .
and the lord say unto gideon , the people that be with thee be too many for i to give the midianites into they hand , lest israel vaunt themselves against i , say , mine own hand have save i .
now therefore go to , proclaim in the ear of the people , say , whosoever be fearful and afraid , let he return and depart early from mount gilead .
and there return of the people twenty and two thousand ; and there remain ten thousand .
and the lord say unto gideon , the people be yet too many ; bring they down unto the water , and i will try they for thee there : and it shall be , that of whom i say unto thee , this shall go with thee , the same shall go with thee ; and of whomsoever i say unto thee , this shall not go with thee , the same shall not go .
so he bring down the people unto the water : and the lord say unto gideon , every one that lappeth of the water with he tongue , as a dog lappeth , he shalt thou set by himself ; likewise every one that boweth down upon he knee to drink .
and the number of they that lap , put they hand to they mouth , be three hundred man : but all the rest of the people bow down upon they knee to drink water .
and the lord say unto gideon , by the three hundred man that lap will i save you , and deliver the midianites into thine hand : and let all the other people go every man unto he place .
so the people take victuals in they hand , and they trumpet : and he send all the rest of israel every man unto he tent , and retain those three hundred man : and the host of midian be beneath he in the valley .
and it come to pass the same night , that the lord say unto he , arise , get thee down unto the host ; for i have deliver it into thine hand .
but if thou fear to go down , go thou with phurah thy servant down to the host :
and thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall thine hand be strengthen to go down unto the host .
then go he down with phurah he servant unto the outside of the armed man that be in the host .
and the midianites and the amalekites and all the child of the east lay along in the valley like grasshopper for multitude ; and they camel be without number , as the sand by the sea side for multitude .
and when gideon be come , behold , there be a man that tell a dream unto he fellow , and say , behold , i dream a dream , and , lo , a cake of barley bread tumble into the host of midian , and come unto a tent , and smite it that it fall , and overturn it , that the tent lay along .
and he fellow answer and say , this be nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash , a man of israel : for into he hand have god deliver midian , and all the host .
and it be so , when gideon hear the tell of the dream , and the interpretation thereof , that he worship , and return into the host of israel , and say , arise ; for the lord have deliver into you hand the host of midian .
and he divide the three hundred man into three company , and he put a trumpet in every man 's hand , with empty pitcher , and lamp within the pitcher .
and he say unto they , look on i , and do likewise : and , behold , when i come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that , as i do , so shall ye do .
when i blow with a trumpet , i and all that be with i , then blow ye the trumpet also on every side of all the camp , and say , the sword of the lord , and of gideon .
so gideon , and the hundred man that be with he , come unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch ; and they have but newly set the watch : and they blow the trumpet , and brake the pitcher that be in they hand .
and the three company blow the trumpet , and brake the pitcher , and hold the lamp in they left hand , and the trumpet in they right hand to blow withal : and they cry , the sword of the lord , and of gideon .
and they stand every man in he place round about the camp ; and all the host run , and cry , and flee .
and the three hundred blow the trumpet , and the lord set every man 's sword against he fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host flee to bethshittah in zererath , and to the border of abelmeholah , unto tabbath .
and the man of israel gather themselves together out of naphtali , and out of asher , and out of all manasseh , and pursue after the midianites .
and gideon send messenger throughout all mount ephraim , say , come down against the midianites , and take before they the water unto bethbarah and jordan .
then all the man of ephraim gather themselves together , and take the water unto bethbarah and jordan .
and they take two prince of the midianites , oreb and zeeb ; and they slew oreb upon the rock oreb , and zeeb they slew at the winepress of zeeb , and pursue midian , and bring the head of oreb and zeeb to gideon on the other side jordan .
and the man of ephraim say unto he , why hast thou serve we thus , that thou calledst we not , when thou wentest to fight with the midianites ?
and they do chide with he sharply .
and he say unto they , what have i do now in comparison of you ?
be not the gleaning of the grape of ephraim better than the vintage of abiezer ?
god have deliver into you hand the prince of midian , oreb and zeeb : and what be i able to do in comparison of you ?
then they anger be abate toward he , when he have say that .
and gideon come to jordan , and pass over , he , and the three hundred man that be with he , faint , yet pursue they .
and he say unto the man of succoth , give , i pray you , loaf of bread unto the people that follow i ; for they be faint , and i be pursue after zebah and zalmunna , king of midian .
and the prince of succoth say , be the hand of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thine army ?
and gideon say , therefore when the lord have deliver zebah and zalmunna into mine hand , then i will tear you flesh with the thorn of the wilderness and with brier .
and he go up thence to penuel , and spake unto they likewise : and the man of penuel answer he as the man of succoth have answer he .
and he spake also unto the man of penuel , say , when i come again in peace , i will break down this tower .
now zebah and zalmunna be in karkor , and they host with they , about fifteen thousand man , all that be leave of all the host of the child of the east : for there fall a hundred and twenty thousand man that draw sword .
and gideon go up by the way of they that dwelt in tent on the east of nobah and jogbehah , and smite the host : for the host be secure .
and when zebah and zalmunna flee , he pursue after they , and take the two king of midian , zebah and zalmunna , and discomfited all the host .
and gideon the son of joash return from battle before the sun be up ,
and catch a young man of the man of succoth , and enquire of he : and he describe unto he the prince of succoth , and the elder thereof , even threescore and seventeen man .
and he come unto the man of succoth , and say , behold zebah and zalmunna , with whom ye do upbraid i , say , be the hand of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thy man that be weary ?
and he take the elder of the city , and thorn of the wilderness and brier , and with they he teach the man of succoth .
and he beat down the tower of penuel , and slew the man of the city .
then say he unto zebah and zalmunna , what manner of man be they whom ye slew at tabor ?
and they answer , as thou art , so be they ; each one resemble the child of a king .
and he say , they be my brethren , even the son of my mother : as the lord liveth , if ye have save they alive , i would not slay you .
and he say unto jether he firstborn , up , and slay they .
but the youth draw not he sword : for he fear , because he be yet a youth .
then zebah and zalmunna say , rise thou , and fall upon we : for as the man be , so be he strength .
and gideon arise , and slew zebah and zalmunna , and take away the ornament that be on they camel ' neck .
then the man of israel say unto gideon , rule thou over we , both thou , and thy son , and thy son 's son also : for thou hast deliver we from the hand of midian .
and gideon say unto they , i will not rule over you , neither shall my son rule over you : the lord shall rule over you .
and gideon say unto they , i would desire a request of you , that ye would give i every man the earring of he prey .
( for they have golden earring , because they be ishmaelites . )
and they answer , we will willingly give they .
and they spread a garment , and do cast therein every man the earring of he prey .
and the weight of the golden earring that he request be a thousand and seven hundred shekel of gold ; beside ornament , and collar , and purple raiment that be on the king of midian , and beside the chain that be about they camel ' neck .
and gideon make a ephod thereof , and put it in he city , even in ophrah : and all israel go thither a whoring after it : which thing become a snare unto gideon , and to he house .
thus be midian subdue before the child of israel , so that they lift up they head no more .
and the country be in quietness forty year in the day of gideon .
and jerubbaal the son of joash go and dwelt in he own house .
and gideon have threescore and ten son of he body begotten : for he have many wife .
and he concubine that be in shechem , she also bare he a son , whose name he call abimelech .
and gideon the son of joash die in a good old age , and be bury in the sepulchre of joash he father , in ophrah of the abiezrites .
and it come to pass , as soon as gideon be dead , that the child of israel turn again , and go a whoring after baalim , and make baalberith they god .
and the child of israel remember not the lord they god , who have deliver they out of the hand of all they enemy on every side :
neither shew they kindness to the house of jerubbaal , namely , gideon , accord to all the goodness which he have shew unto israel .
and abimelech the son of jerubbaal go to shechem unto he mother 's brethren , and commune with they , and with all the family of the house of he mother 's father , say ,
speak , i pray you , in the ear of all the man of shechem , whether be better for you , either that all the son of jerubbaal , which be threescore and ten person , reign over you , or that one reign over you ? remember also that i be you bone and you flesh .
and he mother 's brethren spake of he in the ear of all the man of shechem all these word : and they heart incline to follow abimelech ; for they say , he be we brother .
and they give he threescore and ten piece of silver out of the house of baalberith , wherewith abimelech hire vain and light person , which follow he .
and he go unto he father 's house at ophrah , and slew he brethren the son of jerubbaal , be threescore and ten person , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal be leave ; for he hide himself .
and all the man of shechem gather together , and all the house of millo , and go , and make abimelech king , by the plain of the pillar that be in shechem .
and when they tell it to jotham , he go and stand in the top of mount gerizim , and lift up he voice , and cry , and say unto they , hearken unto i , ye man of shechem , that god may hearken unto you .
the tree go forth on a time to anoint a king over they ; and they say unto the olive tree , reign thou over we .
but the olive tree say unto they , should i leave my fatness , wherewith by i they honour god and man , and go to be promote over the tree ?
and the tree say to the fig tree , come thou , and reign over we .
but the fig tree say unto they , should i forsake my sweetness , and my good fruit , and go to be promote over the tree ?
then say the tree unto the vine , come thou , and reign over we .
and the vine say unto they , should i leave my wine , which cheereth god and man , and go to be promote over the tree ?
then say all the tree unto the bramble , come thou , and reign over we .
and the bramble say unto the tree , if in truth ye anoint i king over you , then come and put you trust in my shadow : and if not , let fire come out of the bramble , and devour the cedar of lebanon .
now therefore , if ye have do truly and sincerely , in that ye have make abimelech king , and if ye have deal well with jerubbaal and he house , and have do unto he accord to the deserving of he hand ;
( for my father fight for you , and adventure he life far , and deliver you out of the hand of midian :
and ye be rise up against my father 's house this day , and have slay he son , threescore and ten person , upon one stone , and have make abimelech , the son of he maidservant , king over the man of shechem , because he be you brother ; )
if ye then have deal truly and sincerely with jerubbaal and with he house this day , then rejoice ye in abimelech , and let he also rejoice in you :
but if not , let fire come out from abimelech , and devour the man of shechem , and the house of millo ; and let fire come out from the man of shechem , and from the house of millo , and devour abimelech .
and jotham run away , and flee , and go to beer , and dwelt there , for fear of abimelech he brother .
when abimelech have reign three year over israel ,
then god send a evil spirit between abimelech and the man of shechem ; and the man of shechem deal treacherously with abimelech :
that the cruelty do to the threescore and ten son of jerubbaal might come , and they blood be lay upon abimelech they brother , which slew they ; and upon the man of shechem , which aid he in the killing of he brethren .
and the man of shechem set lier in wait for he in the top of the mountain , and they rob all that come along that way by they : and it be tell abimelech .
and gaal the son of ebed come with he brethren , and go over to shechem : and the man of shechem put they confidence in he .
and they go out into the field , and gather they vineyard , and trode the grape , and make merry , and go into the house of they god , and do eat and drink , and curse abimelech .
and gaal the son of ebed say , who be abimelech , and who be shechem , that we should serve he ? be not he the son of jerubbaal ? and zebul he officer ? serve the man of hamor the father of shechem : for why should we serve he ?
and would to god this people be under my hand ! then would i remove abimelech .
and he say to abimelech , increase thine army , and come out .
and when zebul the ruler of the city hear the word of gaal the son of ebed , he anger be kindle .
and he send messenger unto abimelech privily , say , behold , gaal the son of ebed and he brethren be come to shechem ; and , behold , they fortify the city against thee .
now therefore up by night , thou and the people that be with thee , and lie in wait in the field :
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun be up , thou shalt rise early , and set upon the city : and , behold , when he and the people that be with he come out against thee , then mayest thou do to they as thou shalt find occasion .
and abimelech rise up , and all the people that be with he , by night , and they lay wait against shechem in four company .
and gaal the son of ebed go out , and stand in the enter of the gate of the city : and abimelech rise up , and the people that be with he , from lie in wait .
and when gaal see the people , he say to zebul , behold , there come people down from the top of the mountain .
and zebul say unto he , thou seest the shadow of the mountain as if they be man .
and gaal spake again and say , see there come people down by the middle of the land , and another company come along by the plain of meonenim .
then say zebul unto he , where be now thy mouth , wherewith thou saidst , who be abimelech , that we should serve he ? be not this the people that thou hast despise ? go out , i pray now , and fight with they .
and gaal go out before the man of shechem , and fight with abimelech .
and abimelech chase he , and he flee before he , and many be overthrow and wound , even unto the enter of the gate .
and abimelech dwelt at arumah : and zebul thrust out gaal and he brethren , that they should not dwell in shechem .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that the people go out into the field ; and they tell abimelech .
and he take the people , and divide they into three company , and lay wait in the field , and look , and , behold , the people be come forth out of the city ; and he rise up against they , and smite they .
and abimelech , and the company that be with he , rush forward , and stand in the enter of the gate of the city : and the two other company run upon all the people that be in the field , and slew they .
and abimelech fight against the city all that day ; and he take the city , and slew the people that be therein , and beat down the city , and sow it with salt .
and when all the man of the tower of shechem hear that , they enter into a hold of the house of the god berith .
and it be tell abimelech , that all the man of the tower of shechem be gather together .
and abimelech gat he up to mount zalmon , he and all the people that be with he ; and abimelech take a axe in he hand , and cut down a bough from the tree , and take it , and lay it on he shoulder , and say unto the people that be with he , what ye have see i do , make haste , and do as i have do .
and all the people likewise cut down every man he bough , and follow abimelech , and put they to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon they ; so that all the man of the tower of shechem die also , about a thousand man and woman .
then go abimelech to thebez , and encamp against thebez , and take it .
but there be a strong tower within the city , and thither flee all the man and woman , and all they of the city , and shut it to they , and gat they up to the top of the tower .
and abimelech come unto the tower , and fight against it , and go hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon abimelech 's head , and all to brake he skull .
then he call hastily unto the young man he armourbearer , and say unto he , draw thy sword , and slay i , that man say not of i , a woman slew he .
and he young man thrust he through , and he die .
and when the man of israel see that abimelech be dead , they depart every man unto he place .
thus god render the wickedness of abimelech , which he do unto he father , in slaying he seventy brethren :
and all the evil of the man of shechem do god render upon they head : and upon they come the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal .
and after abimelech there arise to defend israel tola the son of puah , the son of dodo , a man of issachar ; and he dwell in shamir in mount ephraim .
and he judge israel twenty and three year , and die , and be bury in shamir .
and after he arise jair , a gileadite , and judge israel twenty and two year .
and he have thirty son that ride on thirty ass colt , and they have thirty city , which be call havothjair unto this day , which be in the land of gilead .
and jair die , and be bury in camon .
and the child of israel do evil again in the sight of the lord , and serve baalim , and ashtaroth , and the god of syria , and the god of zidon , and the god of moab , and the god of the child of ammon , and the god of the philistines , and forsake the lord , and serve not he .
and the anger of the lord be hot against israel , and he sell they into the hand of the philistines , and into the hand of the child of ammon .
and that year they vex and oppress the child of israel : eighteen year , all the child of israel that be on the other side jordan in the land of the amorites , which be in gilead .
moreover the child of ammon pass over jordan to fight also against judah , and against benjamin , and against the house of ephraim ; so that israel be sore distressed .
and the child of israel cry unto the lord , say , we have sin against thee , both because we have forsake we god , and also serve baalim .
and the lord say unto the child of israel , do not i deliver you from the egyptians , and from the amorites , from the child of ammon , and from the philistines ?
the zidonians also , and the amalekites , and the maonites , do oppress you ; and ye cry to i , and i deliver you out of they hand .
yet ye have forsake i , and serve other god : wherefore i will deliver you no more .
go and cry unto the god which ye have choose ; let they deliver you in the time of you tribulation .
and the child of israel say unto the lord , we have sin : do thou unto we whatsoever seemeth good unto thee ; deliver we only , we pray thee , this day .
and they put away the strange god from among they , and serve the lord : and he soul be grieve for the misery of israel .
then the child of ammon be gather together , and encamp in gilead .
and the child of israel assemble themselves together , and encamp in mizpeh .
and the people and prince of gilead say one to another , what man be he that will begin to fight against the child of ammon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitant of gilead .
now jephthah the gileadite be a mighty man of valour , and he be the son of a harlot : and gilead beget jephthah .
and gilead 's wife bare he son ; and he wife 's son grow up , and they thrust out jephthah , and say unto he , thou shalt not inherit in we father 's house ; for thou art the son of a strange woman .
then jephthah flee from he brethren , and dwelt in the land of tob : and there be gather vain man to jephthah , and go out with he .
and it come to pass in process of time , that the child of ammon make war against israel .
and it be so , that when the child of ammon make war against israel , the elder of gilead go to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob :
and they say unto jephthah , come , and be we captain , that we may fight with the child of ammon .
and jephthah say unto the elder of gilead , do not ye hate i , and expel i out of my father 's house ? and why be ye come unto i now when ye be in distress ?
and the elder of gilead say unto jephthah , therefore we turn again to thee now , that thou mayest go with we , and fight against the child of ammon , and be we head over all the inhabitant of gilead .
and jephthah say unto the elder of gilead , if ye bring i home again to fight against the child of ammon , and the lord deliver they before i , shall i be you head ?
and the elder of gilead say unto jephthah , the lord be witness between we , if we do not so accord to thy word .
then jephthah go with the elder of gilead , and the people make he head and captain over they : and jephthah utter all he word before the lord in mizpeh .
and jephthah send messenger unto the king of the child of ammon , say , what hast thou to do with i , that thou art come against i to fight in my land ?
and the king of the child of ammon answer unto the messenger of jephthah , because israel take away my land , when they come up out of egypt , from arnon even unto jabbok , and unto jordan : now therefore restore those land again peaceably .
and jephthah send messenger again unto the king of the child of ammon :
and say unto he , thus saith jephthah , israel take not away the land of moab , nor the land of the child of ammon :
but when israel come up from egypt , and walk through the wilderness unto the red sea , and come to kadesh ;
then israel send messenger unto the king of edom , say , let i , i pray thee , pass through thy land : but the king of edom would not hearken thereto .
and in like manner they send unto the king of moab : but he would not consent : and israel abode in kadesh .
then they go along through the wilderness , and compass the land of edom , and the land of moab , and come by the east side of the land of moab , and pitch on the other side of arnon , but come not within the border of moab : for arnon be the border of moab .
and israel send messenger unto sihon king of the amorites , the king of heshbon ; and israel say unto he , let we pass , we pray thee , through thy land into my place .
but sihon trust not israel to pass through he coast : but sihon gather all he people together , and pitch in jahaz , and fight against israel .
and the lord god of israel deliver sihon and all he people into the hand of israel , and they smite they : so israel possess all the land of the amorites , the inhabitant of that country .
and they possess all the coast of the amorites , from arnon even unto jabbok , and from the wilderness even unto jordan .
so now the lord god of israel have dispossessed the amorites from before he people israel , and shouldest thou possess it ?
wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess ?
so whomsoever the lord we god shall drive out from before we , they will we possess .
and now art thou any thing better than balak the son of zippor , king of moab ? do he ever strive against israel , or do he ever fight against they ,
while israel dwelt in heshbon and she town , and in aroer and she town , and in all the city that be along by the coast of arnon , three hundred year ? why therefore do ye not recover they within that time ?
wherefore i have not sin against thee , but thou doest i wrong to war against i : the lord the judge be judge this day between the child of israel and the child of ammon .
howbeit the king of the child of ammon hearken not unto the word of jephthah which he send he .
then the spirit of the lord come upon jephthah , and he pass over gilead , and manasseh , and pass over mizpeh of gilead , and from mizpeh of gilead he pass over unto the child of ammon .
and jephthah vow a vow unto the lord , and say , if thou shalt without fail deliver the child of ammon into mine hand ,
then it shall be , that whatsoever cometh forth of the door of my house to meet i , when i return in peace from the child of ammon , shall surely be the lord 's , and i will offer it up for a burnt offering .
so jephthah pass over unto the child of ammon to fight against they ; and the lord deliver they into he hand .
and he smite they from aroer , even till thou come to minnith , even twenty city , and unto the plain of the vineyard , with a very great slaughter .
thus the child of ammon be subdue before the child of israel .
and jephthah come to mizpeh unto he house , and , behold , he daughter come out to meet he with timbrel and with dance : and she be he only child ; beside she he have neither son nor daughter .
and it come to pass , when he see she , that he rent he clothes , and say , alas , my daughter ! thou hast bring i very low , and thou art one of they that trouble i : for i have open my mouth unto the lord , and i can not go back .
and she say unto he , my father , if thou hast open thy mouth unto the lord , do to i accord to that which have proceed out of thy mouth ; forasmuch as the lord have take vengeance for thee of thine enemy , even of the child of ammon .
and she say unto she father , let this thing be do for i : let i alone two month , that i may go up and down upon the mountain , and bewail my virginity , i and my fellow .
and he say , go .
and he send she away for two month : and she go with she companion , and bewail she virginity upon the mountain .
and it come to pass at the end of two month , that she return unto she father , who do with she accord to he vow which he have vow : and she know no man .
and it be a custom in israel ,
that the daughter of israel go yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four day in a year .
and the man of ephraim gather themselves together , and go northward , and say unto jephthah , wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the child of ammon , and didst not call we to go with thee ? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire .
and jephthah say unto they , i and my people be at great strife with the child of ammon ; and when i call you , ye deliver i not out of they hand .
and when i see that ye deliver i not , i put my life in my hand , and pass over against the child of ammon , and the lord deliver they into my hand : wherefore then be ye come up unto i this day , to fight against i ?
then jephthah gather together all the man of gilead , and fight with ephraim : and the man of gilead smite ephraim , because they say , ye gileadites be fugitive of ephraim among the ephraimites , and among the manassites .
and the gileadites take the passage of jordan before the ephraimites : and it be so , that when those ephraimite which be escape say , let i go over ; that the man of gilead say unto he , art thou a ephraimite ?
if he say , nay ;
then say they unto he , say now shibboleth : and he say sibboleth : for he could not frame to pronounce it right .
then they take he , and slew he at the passage of jordan : and there fall at that time of the ephraimites forty and two thousand .
and jephthah judge israel six year .
then die jephthah the gileadite , and be bury in one of the city of gilead .
and after he ibzan of bethlehem judge israel .
and he have thirty son , and thirty daughter , whom he send abroad , and take in thirty daughter from abroad for he son .
and he judge israel seven year .
then die ibzan , and be bury at bethlehem .
and after he elon , a zebulonite , judge israel ; and he judge israel ten year .
and elon the zebulonite die , and be bury in aijalon in the country of zebulun .
and after he abdon the son of hillel , a pirathonite , judge israel .
and he have forty son and thirty nephew , that ride on threescore and ten ass colt : and he judge israel eight year .
and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite die , and be bury in pirathon in the land of ephraim , in the mount of the amalekites .
and the child of israel do evil again in the sight of the lord ; and the lord deliver they into the hand of the philistines forty year .
and there be a certain man of zorah , of the family of the danites , whose name be manoah ; and he wife be barren , and bare not .
and the angel of the lord appear unto the woman , and say unto she , behold now , thou art barren , and bearest not : but thou shalt conceive , and bear a son .
now therefore beware , i pray thee , and drink not wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing :
for , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no razor shall come on he head : for the child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines .
then the woman come and tell she husband , say , a man of god come unto i , and he countenance be like the countenance of a angel of god , very terrible : but i ask he not whence he be , neither tell he i he name :
but he say unto i , behold , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , neither eat any unclean thing : for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the womb to the day of he death .
then manoah intreat the lord , and say , o my lord , let the man of god which thou didst send come again unto we , and teach we what we shall do unto the child that shall be bear .
and god hearken to the voice of manoah ; and the angel of god come again unto the woman as she sit in the field : but manoah she husband be not with she .
and the woman make haste , and run , and shew she husband , and say unto he , behold , the man have appear unto i , that come unto i the other day .
and manoah arise , and go after he wife , and come to the man , and say unto he , art thou the man that spakest unto the woman ?
and he say , i be .
and manoah say , now let thy word come to pass .
how shall we order the child , and how shall we do unto he ?
and the angel of the lord say unto manoah , of all that i say unto the woman let she beware .
she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine , neither let she drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : all that i command she let she observe .
and manoah say unto the angel of the lord , i pray thee , let we detain thee , until we shall have make ready a kid for thee .
and the angel of the lord say unto manoah , though thou detain i , i will not eat of thy bread : and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the lord .
for manoah know not that he be a angel of the lord .
and manoah say unto the angel of the lord , what be thy name , that when thy saying come to pass we may do thee honour ?
and the angel of the lord say unto he , why askest thou thus after my name , see it be secret ?
so manoah take a kid with a meat offering , and offer it upon a rock unto the lord : and the angel do wonderously ; and manoah and he wife look on .
for it come to pass , when the flame go up toward heaven from off the altar , that the angel of the lord ascend in the flame of the altar .
and manoah and he wife look on it , and fall on they face to the ground .
but the angel of the lord do no more appear to manoah and to he wife .
then manoah know that he be a angel of the lord .
and manoah say unto he wife , we shall surely die , because we have see god .
but he wife say unto he , if the lord be please to kill we , he would not have receive a burnt offering and a meat offering at we hand , neither would he have shew we all these thing , nor would as at this time have tell we such thing as these .
and the woman bare a son , and call he name samson : and the child grow , and the lord bless he .
and the spirit of the lord begin to move he at time in the camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol .
and samson go down to timnath , and see a woman in timnath of the daughter of the philistines .
and he come up , and tell he father and he mother , and say , i have see a woman in timnath of the daughter of the philistines : now therefore get she for i to wife .
then he father and he mother say unto he , be there never a woman among the daughter of thy brethren , or among all my people , that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistine ?
and samson say unto he father , get she for i ; for she pleaseth i well .
but he father and he mother know not that it be of the lord , that he seek a occasion against the philistines : for at that time the philistines have dominion over israel .
then go samson down , and he father and he mother , to timnath , and come to the vineyard of timnath : and , behold , a young lion roar against he .
and the spirit of the lord come mightily upon he , and he rent he as he would have rent a kid , and he have nothing in he hand : but he tell not he father or he mother what he have do .
and he go down , and talk with the woman ; and she please samson well .
and after a time he return to take she , and he turn aside to see the carcase of the lion : and , behold , there be a swarm of bee and honey in the carcase of the lion .
and he take thereof in he hand , and go on eating , and come to he father and mother , and he give they , and they do eat : but he tell not they that he have take the honey out of the carcase of the lion .
so he father go down unto the woman : and samson make there a feast ; for so use the young man to do .
and it come to pass , when they see he , that they bring thirty companion to be with he .
and samson say unto they , i will now put forth a riddle unto you : if ye can certainly declare it i within the seven day of the feast , and find it out , then i will give you thirty sheet and thirty change of garment :
but if ye can not declare it i , then shall ye give i thirty sheet and thirty change of garment .
and they say unto he , put forth thy riddle , that we may hear it .
and he say unto they , out of the eater come forth meat , and out of the strong come forth sweetness .
and they could not in three day expound the riddle .
and it come to pass on the seventh day , that they say unto samson 's wife , entice thy husband , that he may declare unto we the riddle , lest we burn thee and thy father 's house with fire : have ye call we to take that we have ? be it not so ?
and samson 's wife weep before he , and say , thou dost but hate i , and lovest i not : thou hast put forth a riddle unto the child of my people , and hast not tell it i .
and he say unto she , behold , i have not tell it my father nor my mother , and shall i tell it thee ?
and she weep before he the seven day , while they feast last : and it come to pass on the seventh day , that he tell she , because she lay sore upon he : and she tell the riddle to the child of she people .
and the man of the city say unto he on the seventh day before the sun go down , what be sweeter than honey ?
and what be stronger than a lion ?
and he say unto they , if ye have not plow with my heifer , ye have not find out my riddle .
and the spirit of the lord come upon he , and he go down to ashkelon , and slew thirty man of they , and take they spoil , and give change of garment unto they which expound the riddle .
and he anger be kindle , and he go up to he father 's house .
but samson 's wife be give to he companion , whom he have use as he friend .
but it come to pass within a while after , in the time of wheat harvest , that samson visit he wife with a kid ; and he say , i will go in to my wife into the chamber .
but she father would not suffer he to go in .
and she father say , i verily think that thou hadst utterly hate she ; therefore i give she to thy companion : be not she younger sister fairer than she ? take she , i pray thee , instead of she .
and samson say concern they , now shall i be more blameless than the philistines , though i do they a displeasure .
and samson go and catch three hundred fox , and take firebrand , and turn tail to tail , and put a firebrand in the midst between two tail .
and when he have set the brand on fire , he let they go into the standing corn of the philistines , and burn up both the shock , and also the standing corn , with the vineyard and olive .
then the philistines say , who have do this ?
and they answer , samson , the son in law of the timnite , because he have take he wife , and give she to he companion .
and the philistines come up , and burn she and she father with fire .
and samson say unto they , though ye have do this , yet will i be avenge of you , and after that i will cease .
and he smite they hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he go down and dwell in the top of the rock etam .
then the philistines go up , and pitch in judah , and spread themselves in lehi .
and the man of judah say , why be ye come up against we ?
and they answer , to bind samson be we come up , to do to he as he have do to we .
then three thousand man of judah go to the top of the rock etam , and say to samson , knowest thou not that the philistine be ruler over we ? what be this that thou hast do unto we ?
and he say unto they , as they do unto i , so have i do unto they .
and they say unto he , we be come down to bind thee , that we may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines .
and samson say unto they , swear unto i , that ye will not fall upon i yourselve .
and they speak unto he , say , no ; but we will bind thee fast , and deliver thee into they hand : but surely we will not kill thee .
and they bind he with two new cord , and bring he up from the rock .
and when he come unto lehi , the philistines shout against he : and the spirit of the lord come mightily upon he , and the cord that be upon he arm become as flax that be burn with fire , and he band loose from off he hand .
and he find a new jawbone of a ass , and put forth he hand , and take it , and slew a thousand man therewith .
and samson say , with the jawbone of a ass , heap upon heap , with the jaw of a ass have i slay a thousand man .
and it come to pass , when he have make a end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of he hand , and call that place ramathlehus .
and he be sore athirst , and call on the lord , and say , thou hast give this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant : and now shall i die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ?
but god cleave a hollow place that be in the jaw , and there come water thereout ; and when he have drunk , he spirit come again , and he revive : wherefore he call the name thereof enhakkore , which be in lehi unto this day .
and he judge israel in the day of the philistines twenty year .
then go samson to gaza , and see there a harlot , and go in unto she .
and it be tell the gazites , say , samson be come hither .
and they compass he in , and lay wait for he all night in the gate of the city , and be quiet all the night , say , in the morning , when it be day , we shall kill he .
and samson lay till midnight , and arise at midnight , and take the door of the gate of the city , and the two post , and go away with they , bar and all , and put they upon he shoulder , and carry they up to the top of a hill that be before hebron .
and it come to pass afterward , that he love a woman in the valley of sorek , whose name be delilah .
and the lord of the philistines come up unto she , and say unto she , entice he , and see wherein he great strength lieth , and by what mean we may prevail against he , that we may bind he to afflict he : and we will give thee every one of we eleven hundred piece of silver .
and delilah say to samson , tell i , i pray thee , wherein thy great strength lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bind to afflict thee .
and samson say unto she , if they bind i with seven green with that be never dry , then shall i be weak , and be as another man .
then the lord of the philistine bring up to she seven green with which have not be dry , and she bind he with they .
now there be man lie in wait , abide with she in the chamber .
and she say unto he , the philistines be upon thee , samson .
and he brake the with , as a thread of tow be break when it toucheth the fire .
so he strength be not know .
and delilah say unto samson , behold , thou hast mock i , and tell i lie : now tell i , i pray thee , wherewith thou mightest be bind .
and he say unto she , if they bind i fast with new rope that never be occupy , then shall i be weak , and be as another man .
delilah therefore take new rope , and bind he therewith , and say unto he , the philistines be upon thee , samson .
and there be lier in wait abide in the chamber .
and he brake they from off he arm like a thread .
and delilah say unto samson , hitherto thou hast mock i , and tell i lie : tell i wherewith thou mightest be bind .
and he say unto she , if thou weavest the seven lock of my head with the web .
and she fasten it with the pin , and say unto he , the philistines be upon thee , samson .
and he awake out of he sleep , and go away with the pin of the beam , and with the web .
and she say unto he , how canst thou say , i love thee , when thine heart be not with i ? thou hast mock i these three time , and hast not tell i wherein thy great strength lieth .
and it come to pass , when she press he daily with she word , and urge he , so that he soul be vex unto death ;
that he tell she all he heart , and say unto she , there have not come a razor upon mine head ; for i have be a nazarite unto god from my mother 's womb : if i be shave , then my strength will go from i , and i shall become weak , and be like any other man .
and when delilah see that he have tell she all he heart , she send and call for the lord of the philistines , say , come up this once , for he have shew i all he heart .
then the lord of the philistines come up unto she , and bring money in they hand .
and she make he sleep upon she knee ; and she call for a man , and she cause he to shave off the seven lock of he head ; and she begin to afflict he , and he strength go from he .
and she say , the philistines be upon thee , samson .
and he awake out of he sleep , and say , i will go out as at other time before , and shake myself .
and he wist not that the lord be depart from he .
but the philistines take he , and put out he eye , and bring he down to gaza , and bind he with fetter of brass ; and he do grind in the prison house .
howbeit the hair of he head begin to grow again after he be shaven .
then the lord of the philistines gather they together for to offer a great sacrifice unto dagon they god , and to rejoice : for they say , we god have deliver samson we enemy into we hand .
and when the people see he , they praise they god : for they say , we god have deliver into we hand we enemy , and the destroyer of we country , which slew many of we .
and it come to pass , when they heart be merry , that they say , call for samson , that he may make we sport .
and they call for samson out of the prison house ; and he make they sport : and they set he between the pillar .
and samson say unto the lad that hold he by the hand , suffer i that i may feel the pillar whereupon the house standeth , that i may lean upon they .
now the house be full of man and woman ; and all the lord of the philistines be there ; and there be upon the roof about three thousand man and woman , that beheld while samson make sport .
and samson call unto the lord , and say , o lord god , remember i , i pray thee , and strengthen i , i pray thee , only this once , o god , that i may be at once avenge of the philistines for my two eye .
and samson take hold of the two middle pillar upon which the house stand , and on which it be bear up , of the one with he right hand , and of the other with he left .
and samson say , let i die with the philistines .
and he bow himself with all he might ; and the house fall upon the lord , and upon all the people that be therein .
so the dead which he slew at he death be more than they which he slew in he life .
then he brethren and all the house of he father come down , and take he , and bring he up , and bury he between zorah and eshtaol in the buryingplace of manoah he father .
and he judge israel twenty year .
and there be a man of mount ephraim , whose name be micah .
and he say unto he mother , the eleven hundred shekel of silver that be take from thee , about which thou cursedst , and spakest of also in mine ear , behold , the silver be with i ; i take it .
and he mother say , bless be thou of the lord , my son .
and when he have restore the eleven hundred shekel of silver to he mother , he mother say , i have wholly dedicate the silver unto the lord from my hand for my son , to make a graven image and a molten image : now therefore i will restore it unto thee .
yet he restore the money unto he mother ; and he mother take two hundred shekel of silver , and give they to the founder , who make thereof a graven image and a molten image : and they be in the house of micah .
and the man micah have a house of god , and make a ephod , and teraphim , and consecrate one of he son , who become he priest .
in those day there be no king in israel , but every man do that which be right in he own eye .
and there be a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family of judah , who be a levite , and he sojourn there .
and the man depart out of the city from bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place : and he come to mount ephraim to the house of micah , as he journey .
and micah say unto he , whence comest thou ?
and he say unto he , i be a levite of bethlehemjudah , and i go to sojourn where i may find a place .
and micah say unto he , dwell with i , and be unto i a father and a priest , and i will give thee ten shekel of silver by the year , and a suit of apparel , and thy victuals .
so the levite go in .
and the levite be content to dwell with the man ; and the young man be unto he as one of he son .
and micah consecrate the levite ; and the young man become he priest , and be in the house of micah .
then say micah , now know i that the lord will do i good , see i have a levite to my priest .
in those day there be no king in israel : and in those day the tribe of the danites seek they a inheritance to dwell in ; for unto that day all they inheritance have not fall unto they among the tribe of israel .
and the child of dan send of they family five man from they coast , man of valour , from zorah , and from eshtaol , to spy out the land , and to search it ; and they say unto they , go , search the land : who when they come to mount ephraim , to the house of micah , they lodge there .
when they be by the house of micah , they know the voice of the young man the levite : and they turn in thither , and say unto he , who bring thee hither ? and what makest thou in this place ? and what hast thou here ?
and he say unto they , thus and thus dealeth micah with i , and have hire i , and i be he priest .
and they say unto he , ask counsel , we pray thee , of god , that we may know whether we way which we go shall be prosperous .
and the priest say unto they , go in peace : before the lord be you way wherein ye go .
then the five man depart , and come to laish , and see the people that be therein , how they dwell careless , after the manner of the zidonians , quiet and secure ; and there be no magistrate in the land , that might put they to shame in any thing ; and they be far from the zidonians , and have no business with any man .
and they come unto they brethren to zorah and eshtaol : and they brethren say unto they , what say ye ?
and they say , arise , that we may go up against they : for we have see the land , and , behold , it be very good : and be ye still ? be not slothful to go , and to enter to possess the land .
when ye go , ye shall come unto a people secure , and to a large land : for god have give it into you hand ; a place where there be no want of any thing that be in the earth .
and there go from thence of the family of the danites , out of zorah and out of eshtaol , six hundred man appoint with weapon of war .
and they go up , and pitch in kirjathjearim , in judah : wherefore they call that place mahanehdan unto this day : behold , it be behind kirjathjearim .
and they pass thence unto mount ephraim , and come unto the house of micah .
then answer the five man that go to spy out the country of laish , and say unto they brethren , do ye know that there be in these house a ephod , and teraphim , and a graven image , and a molten image ? now therefore consider what ye have to do .
and they turn thitherward , and come to the house of the young man the levite , even unto the house of micah , and salute he .
and the six hundred man appoint with they weapon of war , which be of the child of dan , stand by the enter of the gate .
and the five man that go to spy out the land go up , and come in thither , and take the graven image , and the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image : and the priest stand in the enter of the gate with the six hundred man that be appoint with weapon of war .
and these go into micah 's house , and fetch the carve image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image .
then say the priest unto they , what do ye ?
and they say unto he , hold thy peace , lay thine hand upon thy mouth , and go with we , and be to we a father and a priest : be it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man , or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in israel ?
and the priest 's heart be glad , and he take the ephod , and the teraphim , and the graven image , and go in the midst of the people .
so they turn and depart , and put the little one and the cattle and the carriage before they .
and when they be a good way from the house of micah , the man that be in the house near to micah 's house be gather together , and overtake the child of dan .
and they cry unto the child of dan .
and they turn they face , and say unto micah , what aileth thee , that thou comest with such a company ?
and he say , ye have take away my god which i make , and the priest , and ye be go away : and what have i more ? and what be this that ye say unto i , what aileth thee ?
and the child of dan say unto he , let not thy voice be hear among we , lest angry fellow run upon thee , and thou lose thy life , with the life of thy household .
and the child of dan go they way : and when micah see that they be too strong for he , he turn and go back unto he house .
and they take the thing which micah have make , and the priest which he have , and come unto laish , unto a people that be at quiet and secure : and they smite they with the edge of the sword , and burn the city with fire .
and there be no deliverer , because it be far from zidon , and they have no business with any man ; and it be in the valley that lieth by bethrehob .
and they build a city , and dwelt therein .
and they call the name of the city dan , after the name of dan they father , who be bear unto israel : howbeit the name of the city be laish at the first .
and the child of dan set up the graven image : and jonathan , the son of gershom , the son of manasseh , he and he son be priest to the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land .
and they set they up micah 's graven image , which he make , all the time that the house of god be in shiloh .
and it come to pass in those day , when there be no king in israel , that there be a certain levite sojourn on the side of mount ephraim , who take to he a concubine out of bethlehemjudah .
and he concubine play the whore against he , and go away from he unto she father 's house to bethlehemjudah , and be there four whole month .
and she husband arise , and go after she , to speak friendly unto she , and to bring she again , have he servant with he , and a couple of ass : and she bring he into she father 's house : and when the father of the damsel see he , he rejoice to meet he .
and he father in law , the damsel 's father , retain he ; and he abode with he three day : so they do eat and drink , and lodge there .
and it come to pass on the fourth day , when they arise early in the morning , that he rise up to depart : and the damsel 's father say unto he son in law , comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go you way .
and they sit down , and do eat and drink both of they together : for the damsel 's father have say unto the man , be content , i pray thee , and tarry all night , and let thine heart be merry .
and when the man rise up to depart , he father in law urge he : therefore he lodge there again .
and he arise early in the morning on the fifth day to depart : and the damsel 's father say , comfort thine heart , i pray thee .
and they tarry until afternoon , and they do eat both of they .
and when the man rise up to depart , he , and he concubine , and he servant , he father in law , the damsel 's father , say unto he , behold , now the day draweth toward evening , i pray you tarry all night : behold , the day groweth to a end , lodge here , that thine heart may be merry ; and to morrow get you early on you way , that thou mayest go home .
but the man would not tarry that night , but he rise up and depart , and come over against jebus , which be jerusalem ; and there be with he two ass saddle , he concubine also be with he .
and when they be by jebus , the day be far spend ; and the servant say unto he master , come , i pray thee , and let we turn in into this city of the jebusites , and lodge in it .
and he master say unto he , we will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger , that be not of the child of israel ; we will pass over to gibeah .
and he say unto he servant , come , and let we draw near to one of these place to lodge all night , in gibeah , or in ramah .
and they pass on and go they way ; and the sun go down upon they when they be by gibeah , which belongeth to benjamin .
and they turn aside thither , to go in and to lodge in gibeah : and when he go in , he sit he down in a street of the city : for there be no man that take they into he house to lodging .
and , behold , there come a old man from he work out of the field at even , which be also of mount ephraim ; and he sojourn in gibeah : but the man of the place be benjamites .
and when he have lift up he eye , he see a wayfaring man in the street of the city : and the old man say , whither goest thou ? and whence comest thou ?
and he say unto he , we be pass from bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim ; from thence be i : and i go to bethlehemjudah , but i be now go to the house of the lord ; and there be no man that receiveth i to house .
yet there be both straw and provender for we ass ; and there be bread and wine also for i , and for thy handmaid , and for the young man which be with thy servant : there be no want of any thing .
and the old man say , peace be with thee ; howsoever let all thy want lie upon i ; only lodge not in the street .
so he bring he into he house , and give provender unto the ass : and they wash they foot , and do eat and drink .
now as they be make they heart merry , behold , the man of the city , certain son of belial , beset the house round about , and beat at the door , and spake to the master of the house , the old man , say , bring forth the man that come into thine house , that we may know he .
and the man , the master of the house , go out unto they , and say unto they , nay , my brethren , nay , i pray you , do not so wickedly ; see that this man be come into mine house , do not this folly .
behold , here be my daughter a maiden , and he concubine ; they i will bring out now , and humble ye they , and do with they what seemeth good unto you : but unto this man do not so vile a thing .
but the man would not hearken to he : so the man take he concubine , and bring she forth unto they ; and they know she , and abuse she all the night until the morning : and when the day begin to spring , they let she go .
then come the woman in the dawn of the day , and fall down at the door of the man 's house where she lord be , till it be light .
and she lord rise up in the morning , and open the door of the house , and go out to go he way : and , behold , the woman he concubine be fall down at the door of the house , and she hand be upon the threshold .
and he say unto she , up , and let we be go .
but none answer .
then the man take she up upon a ass , and the man rise up , and gat he unto he place .
and when he be come into he house , he take a knife , and lay hold on he concubine , and divide she , together with she bone , into twelve piece , and send she into all the coast of israel .
and it be so , that all that see it say , there be no such deed do nor see from the day that the child of israel come up out of the land of egypt unto this day : consider of it , take advice , and speak you mind .
then all the child of israel go out , and the congregation be gather together as one man , from dan even to beersheba , with the land of gilead , unto the lord in mizpeh .
and the chief of all the people , even of all the tribe of israel , present themselves in the assembly of the people of god , four hundred thousand footman that draw sword .
( now the child of benjamin hear that the child of israel be go up to mizpeh . )
then say the child of israel , tell we , how be this wickedness ?
and the levite , the husband of the woman that be slay , answer and say , i come into gibeah that belongeth to benjamin , i and my concubine , to lodge .
and the man of gibeah rise against i , and beset the house round about upon i by night , and think to have slay i : and my concubine have they force , that she be dead .
and i take my concubine , and cut she in piece , and send she throughout all the country of the inheritance of israel : for they have commit lewdness and folly in israel .
behold , ye be all child of israel ; give here you advice and counsel .
and all the people arise as one man , say , we will not any of we go to he tent , neither will we any of we turn into he house .
but now this shall be the thing which we will do to gibeah ; we will go up by lot against it ;
and we will take ten man of a hundred throughout all the tribe of israel , and a hundred of a thousand , and a thousand out of ten thousand , to fetch victual for the people , that they may do , when they come to gibeah of benjamin , accord to all the folly that they have work in israel .
so all the man of israel be gather against the city , knit together as one man .
and the tribe of israel send man through all the tribe of benjamin , say , what wickedness be this that be do among you ?
now therefore deliver we the man , the child of belial , which be in gibeah , that we may put they to death , and put away evil from israel .
but the child of benjamin would not hearken to the voice of they brethren the child of israel :
but the child of benjamin gather themselves together out of the city unto gibeah , to go out to battle against the child of israel .
and the child of benjamin be number at that time out of the city twenty and six thousand man that draw sword , beside the inhabitant of gibeah , which be number seven hundred choose man .
among all this people there be seven hundred choose man lefthand ; every one could sling stone at a hair breadth , and not miss .
and the man of israel , beside benjamin , be number four hundred thousand man that draw sword : all these be man of war .
and the child of israel arise , and go up to the house of god , and ask counsel of god , and say , which of we shall go up first to the battle against the child of benjamin ?
and the lord say , judah shall go up first .
and the child of israel rise up in the morning , and encamp against gibeah .
and the man of israel go out to battle against benjamin ; and the man of israel put themselves in array to fight against they at gibeah .
and the child of benjamin come forth out of gibeah , and destroy down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and two thousand man .
and the people the man of israel encourage themselves , and set they battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
( and the child of israel go up and weep before the lord until even , and ask counsel of the lord , say , shall i go up again to battle against the child of benjamin my brother ?
and the lord say , go up against he . )
and the child of israel come near against the child of benjamin the second day .
and benjamin go forth against they out of gibeah the second day , and destroy down to the ground of the child of israel again eighteen thousand man ; all these draw the sword .
then all the child of israel , and all the people , go up , and come unto the house of god , and weep , and sit there before the lord , and fast that day until even , and offer burnt offering and peace offering before the lord .
and the child of israel enquire of the lord , ( for the ark of the covenant of god be there in those day ,
and phinehas , the son of eleazar , the son of aaron , stand before it in those day , ) say , shall i yet again go out to battle against the child of benjamin my brother , or shall i cease ?
and the lord say , go up ; for to morrow i will deliver they into thine hand .
and israel set lier in wait round about gibeah .
and the child of israel go up against the child of benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against gibeah , as at other time .
and the child of benjamin go out against the people , and be draw away from the city ; and they begin to smite of the people , and kill , as at other time , in the highway , of which one goeth up to the house of god , and the other to gibeah in the field , about thirty man of israel .
and the child of benjamin say , they be smite down before we , as at the first .
but the child of israel say , let we flee , and draw they from the city unto the highway .
and all the man of israel rise up out of they place , and put themselves in array at baaltamar : and the lier in wait of israel come forth out of they place , even out of the meadow of gibeah .
and there come against gibeah ten thousand choose man out of all israel , and the battle be sore : but they know not that evil be near they .
and the lord smite benjamin before israel : and the child of israel destroy of the benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred man : all these draw the sword .
so the child of benjamin see that they be smite : for the man of israel give place to the benjamites , because they trust unto the lier in wait which they have set beside gibeah .
and the lier in wait hast , and rush upon gibeah ; and the lier in wait draw themselves along , and smite all the city with the edge of the sword .
now there be a appoint sign between the man of israel and the lier in wait , that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city .
and when the man of israel retire in the battle , benjamin begin to smite and kill of the man of israel about thirty person : for they say , surely they be smite down before we , as in the first battle .
but when the flame begin to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke , the benjamites look behind they , and , behold , the flame of the city ascend up to heaven .
and when the man of israel turn again , the man of benjamin be amaze : for they see that evil be come upon they .
therefore they turn they back before the man of israel unto the way of the wilderness ; but the battle overtake they ; and they which come out of the city they destroy in the midst of they .
thus they inclose the benjamites round about , and chase they , and trode they down with ease over against gibeah toward the sunrising .
and there fall of benjamin eighteen thousand man ; all these be man of valour .
and they turn and flee toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon : and they glean of they in the highway five thousand man ; and pursued hard after they unto gidom , and slew two thousand man of they .
so that all which fall that day of benjamin be twenty and five thousand man that draw the sword ; all these be man of valour .
but six hundred man turn and flee to the wilderness unto the rock rimmon , and abode in the rock rimmon four month .
and the man of israel turn again upon the child of benjamin , and smite they with the edge of the sword , as well the man of every city , as the beast , and all that come to hand : also they set on fire all the city that they come to .
now the man of israel have swear in mizpeh , say , there shall not any of we give he daughter unto benjamin to wife .
and the people come to the house of god , and abode there till even before god , and lift up they voice , and weep sore ;
and say , o lord god of israel , why be this come to pass in israel , that there should be to day one tribe lack in israel ?
and it come to pass on the morrow , that the people rise early , and build there a altar , and offer burnt offering and peace offering .
and the child of israel say , who be there among all the tribe of israel that come not up with the congregation unto the lord ?
for they have make a great oath concern he that come not up to the lord to mizpeh , say , he shall surely be put to death .
and the child of israel repent they for benjamin they brother , and say , there be one tribe cut off from israel this day .
how shall we do for wife for they that remain , see we have swear by the lord that we will not give they of we daughter to wife ?
and they say , what one be there of the tribe of israel that come not up to mizpeh to the lord ?
and , behold , there come none to the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembly .
for the people be number , and , behold , there be none of the inhabitant of jabeshgilead there .
and the congregation send thither twelve thousand man of the valiantest , and command they , say , go and smite the inhabitant of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword , with the woman and the child .
and this be the thing that ye shall do , ye shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that have lain by man .
and they find among the inhabitant of jabeshgilead four hundred young virgin , that have know no man by lie with any male : and they bring they unto the camp to shiloh , which be in the land of canaan .
and the whole congregation send some to speak to the child of benjamin that be in the rock rimmon , and to call peaceably unto they .
and benjamin come again at that time ; and they give they wife which they have save alive of the woman of jabeshgilead : and yet so they suffice they not .
and the people repent they for benjamin , because that the lord have make a breach in the tribe of israel .
then the elder of the congregation say , how shall we do for wife for they that remain , see the woman be destroy out of benjamin ?
and they say , there must be a inheritance for they that be escape of benjamin , that a tribe be not destroy out of israel .
howbeit we may not give they wife of we daughter : for the child of israel have swear , say , cursed be he that giveth a wife to benjamin .
then they say , behold , there be a feast of the lord in shiloh yearly in a place which be on the north side of bethel , on the east side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem , and on the south of lebonah .
therefore they command the child of benjamin , say , go and lie in wait in the vineyard ;
and see , and , behold , if the daughter of shiloh come out to dance in dance , then come ye out of the vineyard , and catch you every man he wife of the daughter of shiloh , and go to the land of benjamin .
and it shall be , when they father or they brethren come unto we to complain , that we will say unto they , be favourable unto they for we sake : because we reserve not to each man he wife in the war : for ye do not give unto they at this time , that ye should be guilty .
and the child of benjamin do so , and take they wife , accord to they number , of they that dance , whom they catch : and they go and return unto they inheritance , and repair the city , and dwelt in they .
and the child of israel depart thence at that time , every man to he tribe and to he family , and they go out from thence every man to he inheritance .
in those day there be no king in israel : every man do that which be right in he own eye .
now it come to pass in the day when the judge rule , that there be a famine in the land .
and a certain man of bethlehemjudah go to sojourn in the country of moab , he , and he wife , and he two son .
and the name of the man be elimelech , and the name of he wife naomi , and the name of he two son mahlon and chilion , ephrathites of bethlehemjudah .
and they come into the country of moab , and continue there .
and elimelech naomi 's husband die ; and she be leave , and she two son .
and they take they wife of the woman of moab ; the name of the one be orpah , and the name of the other ruth : and they dwell there about ten year .
and mahlon and chilion die also both of they ; and the woman be leave of she two son and she husband .
then she arise with she daughter in law , that she might return from the country of moab : for she have hear in the country of moab how that the lord have visit he people in give they bread .
wherefore she go forth out of the place where she be , and she two daughter in law with she ; and they go on the way to return unto the land of judah .
and naomi say unto she two daughter in law , go , return each to she mother 's house : the lord deal kindly with you , as ye have deal with the dead , and with i .
the lord grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of she husband .
then she kiss they ; and they lift up they voice , and weep .
and they say unto she , surely we will return with thee unto thy people .
and naomi say , turn again , my daughter : why will ye go with i ? be there yet any more son in my womb , that they may be you husband ?
turn again , my daughter , go you way ; for i be too old to have a husband .
if i should say , i have hope , if i should have a husband also to night , and should also bear son ;
would ye tarry for they till they be grow ? would ye stay for they from have husband ? nay , my daughter ; for it grieveth i much for you sake that the hand of the lord be go out against i .
and they lift up they voice , and weep again : and orpah kiss she mother in law ; but ruth clave unto she .
and she say , behold , thy sister in law be go back unto she people , and unto she god : return thou after thy sister in law .
and ruth say , intreat i not to leave thee , or to return from follow after thee : for whither thou goest , i will go ; and where thou lodgest , i will lodge : thy people shall be my people , and thy god my god :
where thou diest , will i die , and there will i be bury : the lord do so to i , and more also , if ought but death part thee and i .
when she see that she be stedfastly mind to go with she , then she leave speak unto she .
so they two go until they come to bethlehem .
and it come to pass , when they be come to bethlehem , that all the city be move about they , and they say , be this naomi ?
and she say unto they , call i not naomi , call i mara : for the almighty have deal very bitterly with i .
i go out full , and the lord have bring i home again empty : why then call ye i naomi , see the lord have testify against i , and the almighty have afflict i ?
so naomi return , and ruth the moabitess , she daughter in law , with she , which return out of the country of moab : and they come to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
and naomi have a kinsman of she husband 's , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of elimelech ; and he name be boaz .
and ruth the moabitess say unto naomi , let i now go to the field , and glean ear of corn after he in whose sight i shall find grace .
and she say unto she , go , my daughter .
and she go , and come , and glean in the field after the reaper : and she hap be to light on a part of the field belong unto boaz , who be of the kindred of elimelech .
and , behold , boaz come from bethlehem , and say unto the reaper , the lord be with you .
and they answer he , the lord bless thee .
then say boaz unto he servant that be set over the reaper , whose damsel be this ?
and the servant that be set over the reaper answer and say , it be the moabitish damsel that come back with naomi out of the country of moab :
and she say , i pray you , let i glean and gather after the reaper among the sheaf : so she come , and have continue even from the morning until now , that she tarry a little in the house .
then say boaz unto ruth , hearest thou not , my daughter ?
go not to glean in another field , neither go from hence , but abide here fast by my maiden :
let thine eye be on the field that they do reap , and go thou after they : have i not charge the young man that they shall not touch thee ? and when thou art athirst , go unto the vessel , and drink of that which the young man have draw .
then she fall on she face , and bow herself to the ground , and say unto he , why have i find grace in thine eye , that thou shouldest take knowledge of i , see i be a stranger ?
and boaz answer and say unto she , it have fully be shew i , all that thou hast do unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband : and how thou hast leave thy father and thy mother , and the land of thy nativity , and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore .
the lord recompense thy work , and a full reward be give thee of the lord god of israel , under whose wing thou art come to trust .
then she say , let i find favour in thy sight , my lord ; for that thou hast comfort i , and for that thou hast speak friendly unto thine handmaid , though i be not like unto one of thine handmaiden .
and boaz say unto she , at mealtime come thou hither , and eat of the bread , and dip thy morsel in the vinegar .
and she sit beside the reaper : and he reach she parched corn , and she do eat , and be suffice , and leave .
and when she be rise up to glean , boaz command he young man , say , let she glean even among the sheaf , and reproach she not :
and let fall also some of the handful of purpose for she , and leave they , that she may glean they , and rebuke she not .
so she glean in the field until even , and beat out that she have glean : and it be about a ephah of barley .
and she take it up , and go into the city : and she mother in law see what she have glean : and she bring forth , and give to she that she have reserve after she be suffice .
and she mother in law say unto she , where hast thou glean to day ? and where wroughtest thou ? bless be he that do take knowledge of thee .
and she shew she mother in law with whom she have work , and say , the man 's name with whom i work to day be boaz .
and naomi say unto she daughter in law , bless be he of the lord , who have not leave off he kindness to the living and to the dead .
and naomi say unto she , the man be near of kin unto we , one of we next kinsman .
and ruth the moabitess say , he say unto i also , thou shalt keep fast by my young man , until they have end all my harvest .
and naomi say unto ruth she daughter in law , it be good , my daughter , that thou go out with he maiden , that they meet thee not in any other field .
so she keep fast by the maiden of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and dwell with she mother in law .
then naomi she mother in law say unto she , my daughter , shall i not seek rest for thee , that it may be well with thee ?
and now be not boaz of we kindred , with whose maiden thou wast ?
behold , he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor .
wash thyself therefore , and anoint thee , and put thy raiment upon thee , and get thee down to the floor : but make not thyself know unto the man , until he shall have do eating and drinking .
and it shall be , when he lieth down , that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie , and thou shalt go in , and uncover he foot , and lay thee down ; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do .
and she say unto she , all that thou sayest unto i i will do .
and she go down unto the floor , and do accord to all that she mother in law bid she .
and when boaz have eat and drunk , and he heart be merry , he go to lie down at the end of the heap of corn : and she come softly , and uncover he foot , and lay she down .
and it come to pass at midnight , that the man be afraid , and turn himself : and , behold , a woman lay at he foot .
and he say , who art thou ?
and she answer , i be ruth thine handmaid : spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid ; for thou art a near kinsman .
and he say , bless be thou of the lord , my daughter : for thou hast shew more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning , inasmuch as thou followedst not young man , whether poor or rich .
and now , my daughter , fear not ; i will do to thee all that thou requirest : for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman .
and now it be true that i be thy near kinsman : howbeit there be a kinsman nearer than i.
tarry this night , and it shall be in the morning , that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman , well ; let he do the kinsman 's part : but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee , then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee , as the lord liveth : lie down until the morning .
and she lay at he foot until the morning : and she rise up before one could know another .
and he say , let it not be know that a woman come into the floor .
also he say , bring the vail that thou hast upon thee , and hold it .
and when she hold it , he measure six measure of barley , and lay it on she : and she go into the city .
and when she come to she mother in law , she say , who art thou , my daughter ?
and she tell she all that the man have do to she .
and she say , these six measure of barley give he i ; for he say to i , go not empty unto thy mother in law .
then say she , sit still , my daughter , until thou know how the matter will fall : for the man will not be in rest , until he have finish the thing this day .
then go boaz up to the gate , and sit he down there : and , behold , the kinsman of whom boaz spake come by ; unto whom he say , ho , such a one ! turn aside , sit down here .
and he turn aside , and sit down .
and he take ten man of the elder of the city , and say , sit ye down here .
and they sit down .
and he say unto the kinsman , naomi , that be come again out of the country of moab , selleth a parcel of land , which be we brother elimelech 's :
and i think to advertise thee , say , buy it before the inhabitant , and before the elder of my people .
if thou wilt redeem it , redeem it : but if thou wilt not redeem it , then tell i , that i may know : for there be none to redeem it beside thee ; and i be after thee .
and he say , i will redeem it .
then say boaz , what day thou buyest the field of the hand of naomi , thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead upon he inheritance .
and the kinsman say , i can not redeem it for myself , lest i mar mine own inheritance : redeem thou my right to thyself ; for i can not redeem it .
now this be the manner in former time in israel concern redeeming and concern change , for to confirm all thing ; a man pluck off he shoe , and give it to he neighbour : and this be a testimony in israel .
therefore the kinsman say unto boaz , buy it for thee .
so he draw off he shoe .
and boaz say unto the elder , and unto all the people , ye be witness this day , that i have buy all that be elimelech 's , and all that be chilion 's and mahlon 's , of the hand of naomi .
moreover ruth the moabitess , the wife of mahlon , have i purchase to be my wife , to raise up the name of the dead upon he inheritance , that the name of the dead be not cut off from among he brethren , and from the gate of he place : ye be witness this day .
and all the people that be in the gate , and the elder , say , we be witness .
the lord make the woman that be come into thine house like rachel and like leah , which two do build the house of israel : and do thou worthily in ephratah , and be famous in bethlehem :
and let thy house be like the house of pharez , whom tamar bare unto judah , of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young woman .
so boaz take ruth , and she be he wife : and when he go in unto she , the lord give she conception , and she bare a son .
and the woman say unto naomi , blessed be the lord , which have not leave thee this day without a kinsman , that he name may be famous in israel .
and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life , and a nourisher of thine old age : for thy daughter in law , which loveth thee , which be better to thee than seven son , have bear he .
and naomi take the child , and lay it in she bosom , and become nurse unto it .
and the woman she neighbour give it a name , say , there be a son bear to naomi ; and they call he name obed : he be the father of jesse , the father of david .
now these be the generation of pharez : pharez beget hezron ,
and hezron beget ram , and ram beget amminadab ,
and amminadab beget nahshon , and nahshon beget salmon ,
and salmon beget boaz , and boaz beget obed ,
and obed beget jesse , and jesse beget david .
now there be a certain man of ramathaimzophim , of mount ephraim , and he name be elkanah , the son of jeroham , the son of elihu , the son of tohu , the son of zuph , a ephrathite :
and he have two wife ; the name of the one be hannah , and the name of the other peninnah : and peninnah have child , but hannah have no child .
and this man go up out of he city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord of host in shiloh .
and the two son of eli , hophni and phinehas , the priest of the lord , be there .
and when the time be that elkanah offer , he give to peninnah he wife , and to all she son and she daughter , portion :
but unto hannah he give a worthy portion ; for he love hannah : but the lord have shut up she womb .
and she adversary also provoke she sore , for to make she fret , because the lord have shut up she womb .
and as he do so year by year , when she go up to the house of the lord , so she provoke she ; therefore she weep , and do not eat .
then say elkanah she husband to she , hannah , why weepest thou ? and why eatest thou not ? and why be thy heart grieve ? be not i better to thee than ten son ?
so hannah rise up after they have eat in shiloh , and after they have drunk .
now eli the priest sit upon a seat by a post of the temple of the lord .
and she be in bitterness of soul , and pray unto the lord , and weep sore .
and she vow a vow , and say , o lord of host , if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid , and remember i , and not forget thine handmaid , but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child , then i will give he unto the lord all the day of he life , and there shall no razor come upon he head .
and it come to pass , as she continue pray before the lord , that eli mark she mouth .
now hannah , she speak in she heart ; only she lip move , but she voice be not hear : therefore eli think she have be drunken .
and eli say unto she , how long wilt thou be drunken ? put away thy wine from thee .
and hannah answer and say , no , my lord , i be a woman of a sorrowful spirit : i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink , but have pour out my soul before the lord .
count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial : for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have i speak hitherto .
then eli answer and say , go in peace : and the god of israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast ask of he .
and she say , let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight .
so the woman go she way , and do eat , and she countenance be no more sad .
and they rise up in the morning early , and worship before the lord , and return , and come to they house to ramah : and elkanah know hannah he wife ; and the lord remember she .
wherefore it come to pass , when the time be come about after hannah have conceive , that she bare a son , and call he name samuel , say , because i have ask he of the lord .
and the man elkanah , and all he house , go up to offer unto the lord the yearly sacrifice , and he vow .
but hannah go not up ; for she say unto she husband , i will not go up until the child be wean , and then i will bring he , that he may appear before the lord , and there abide for ever .
and elkanah she husband say unto she , do what seemeth thee good ; tarry until thou have wean he ; only the lord establish he word .
so the woman abode , and give she son suck until she wean he .
and when she have wean he , she take he up with she , with three bullock , and one ephah of flour , and a bottle of wine , and bring he unto the house of the lord in shiloh : and the child be young .
and they slew a bullock , and bring the child to eli .
and she say , oh my lord , as thy soul liveth , my lord , i be the woman that stand by thee here , pray unto the lord .
for this child i pray ; and the lord have give i my petition which i ask of he :
therefore also i have lend he to the lord ; as long as he liveth he shall be lend to the lord .
and he worship the lord there .
and hannah pray , and say , my heart rejoiceth in the lord , mine horn be exalt in the lord : my mouth be enlarged over mine enemy ; because i rejoice in thy salvation .
there be none holy as the lord : for there be none beside thee : neither be there any rock like we god .
talk no more so exceed proudly ; let not arrogancy come out of you mouth : for the lord be a god of knowledge , and by he action be weigh .
the bow of the mighty man be break , and they that stumble be gird with strength .
they that be full have hire out themselves for bread ; and they that be hungry cease : so that the barren have bear seven ; and she that have many child be wax feeble .
the lord killeth , and maketh alive : he bringeth down to the grave , and bringeth up .
the lord maketh poor , and maketh rich : he bringeth low , and lifteth up .
he raiseth up the poor out of the dust , and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill , to set they among prince , and to make they inherit the throne of glory : for the pillar of the earth be the lord 's , and he have set the world upon they .
he will keep the foot of he saint , and the wicked shall be silent in darkness ; for by strength shall no man prevail .
the adversary of the lord shall be break to piece ; out of heaven shall he thunder upon they : the lord shall judge the end of the earth ; and he shall give strength unto he king , and exalt the horn of he anointed .
and elkanah go to ramah to he house .
and the child do minister unto the lord before eli the priest .
now the son of eli be son of belial ; they know not the lord .
and the priest ' custom with the people be , that , when any man offer sacrifice , the priest 's servant come , while the flesh be in seething , with a fleshhook of three tooth in he hand ;
and he strike it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fleshhook bring up the priest take for himself .
so they do in shiloh unto all the israelites that come thither .
also before they burn the fat , the priest 's servant come , and say to the man that sacrifice , give flesh to roast for the priest ; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee , but raw .
and if any man say unto he , let they not fail to burn the fat presently , and then take as much as thy soul desireth ; then he would answer he , nay ; but thou shalt give it i now : and if not , i will take it by force .
wherefore the sin of the young man be very great before the lord : for man abhor the offering of the lord .
but samuel minister before the lord , be a child , gird with a linen ephod .
moreover he mother make he a little coat , and bring it to he from year to year , when she come up with she husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
and eli bless elkanah and he wife , and say , the lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which be lend to the lord .
and they go unto they own home .
and the lord visit hannah , so that she conceive , and bare three son and two daughter .
and the child samuel grow before the lord .
now eli be very old , and hear all that he son do unto all israel ; and how they lay with the woman that assemble at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and he say unto they , why do ye such thing ? for i hear of you evil dealings by all this people .
nay , my son ; for it be no good report that i hear : ye make the lord 's people to transgress .
if one man sin against another , the judge shall judge he : but if a man sin against the lord , who shall intreat for he ?
notwithstanding they hearken not unto the voice of they father , because the lord would slay they .
and the child samuel grow on , and be in favour both with the lord , and also with man .
and there come a man of god unto eli , and say unto he , thus saith the lord , do i plainly appear unto the house of thy father , when they be in egypt in pharaoh 's house ?
and do i choose he out of all the tribe of israel to be my priest , to offer upon mine altar , to burn incense , to wear a ephod before i ? and do i give unto the house of thy father all the offering make by fire of the child of israel ?
wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering , which i have command in my habitation ; and honourest thy son above i , to make yourselve fat with the chiefest of all the offering of israel my people ?
wherefore the lord god of israel saith , i say indeed that thy house , and the house of thy father , should walk before i for ever : but now the lord saith , be it far from i ; for they that honour i i will honour , and they that despise i shall be lightly esteem .
behold , the day come , that i will cut off thine arm , and the arm of thy father 's house , that there shall not be a old man in thine house .
and thou shalt see a enemy in my habitation , in all the wealth which god shall give israel : and there shall not be a old man in thine house for ever .
and the man of thine , whom i shall not cut off from mine altar , shall be to consume thine eye , and to grieve thine heart : and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of they age .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , that shall come upon thy two son , on hophni and phinehas ; in one day they shall die both of they .
and i will raise i up a faithful priest , that shall do accord to that which be in mine heart and in my mind : and i will build he a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anoint for ever .
and it shall come to pass , that every one that be leave in thine house shall come and crouch to he for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread , and shall say , put i , i pray thee , into one of the priest ' office , that i may eat a piece of bread .
and the child samuel minister unto the lord before eli .
and the word of the lord be precious in those day ; there be no open vision .
and it come to pass at that time , when eli be lay down in he place , and he eye begin to wax dim , that he could not see ;
and ere the lamp of god go out in the temple of the lord , where the ark of god be , and samuel be lay down to sleep ;
that the lord call samuel : and he answer , here be i.
and he run unto eli , and say , here be i ; for thou calledst i .
and he say , i call not ; lie down again .
and he go and lay down .
and the lord call yet again , samuel .
and samuel arise and go to eli , and say , here be i ; for thou didst call i .
and he answer , i call not , my son ; lie down again .
now samuel do not yet know the lord , neither be the word of the lord yet reveal unto he .
and the lord call samuel again the third time .
and he arise and go to eli , and say , here be i ; for thou didst call i .
and eli perceive that the lord have call the child .
therefore eli say unto samuel , go , lie down : and it shall be , if he call thee , that thou shalt say , speak , lord ; for thy servant heareth .
so samuel go and lay down in he place .
and the lord come , and stand , and call as at other time , samuel , samuel .
then samuel answer , speak ; for thy servant heareth .
and the lord say to samuel , behold , i will do a thing in israel , at which both the ear of every one that heareth it shall tingle .
in that day i will perform against eli all thing which i have speak concern he house : when i begin , i will also make a end .
for i have tell he that i will judge he house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth ; because he son make themselves vile , and he restrain they not .
and therefore i have swear unto the house of eli , that the iniquity of eli 's house shall not be purge with sacrifice nor offering for ever .
and samuel lay until the morning , and open the door of the house of the lord .
and samuel fear to shew eli the vision .
then eli call samuel , and say , samuel , my son .
and he answer , here be i.
and he say , what be the thing that the lord have say unto thee ?
i pray thee hide it not from i : god do so to thee , and more also , if thou hide any thing from i of all the thing that he say unto thee .
and samuel tell he every whit , and hide nothing from he .
and he say , it be the lord : let he do what seemeth he good .
and samuel grow , and the lord be with he , and do let none of he word fall to the ground .
and all israel from dan even to beersheba know that samuel be establish to be a prophet of the lord .
and the lord appear again in shiloh : for the lord reveal himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord .
and the word of samuel come to all israel .
now israel go out against the philistine to battle , and pitch beside ebenezer : and the philistines pitch in aphek .
and the philistines put themselves in array against israel : and when they join battle , israel be smite before the philistines : and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand man .
and when the people be come into the camp , the elder of israel say , wherefore have the lord smite we to day before the philistines ?
let we fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of shiloh unto we , that , when it cometh among we , it may save we out of the hand of we enemy .
so the people send to shiloh , that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of host , which dwelleth between the cherubim : and the two son of eli , hophni and phinehas , be there with the ark of the covenant of god .
and when the ark of the covenant of the lord come into the camp , all israel shout with a great shout , so that the earth ring again .
and when the philistines hear the noise of the shout , they say , what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews ?
and they understand that the ark of the lord be come into the camp .
and the philistines be afraid , for they say , god be come into the camp .
and they say , woe unto we ! for there have not be such a thing heretofore .
woe unto we ! who shall deliver we out of the hand of these mighty god ? these be the god that smite the egyptians with all the plague in the wilderness .
be strong , and quit yourselve like man , o ye philistine , that ye be not servant unto the hebrews , as they have be to you : quit yourselve like man , and fight .
and the philistines fight , and israel be smitten , and they flee every man into he tent : and there be a very great slaughter ; for there fall of israel thirty thousand footman .
and the ark of god be take ; and the two son of eli , hophni and phinehas , be slay .
and there run a man of benjamin out of the army , and come to shiloh the same day with he clothes rent , and with earth upon he head .
and when he come , lo , eli sit upon a seat by the wayside watching : for he heart tremble for the ark of god .
and when the man come into the city , and tell it , all the city cry out .
and when eli hear the noise of the cry , he say , what meaneth the noise of this tumult ?
and the man come in hastily , and tell eli .
now eli be ninety and eight year old ; and he eye be dim , that he could not see .
and the man say unto eli , i be he that come out of the army , and i flee to day out of the army .
and he say , what be there do , my son ?
and the messenger answer and say , israel be flee before the philistines , and there have be also a great slaughter among the people , and thy two son also , hophni and phinehas , be dead , and the ark of god be take .
and it come to pass , when he make mention of the ark of god , that he fall from off the seat backward by the side of the gate , and he neck brake , and he die : for he be a old man , and heavy .
and he have judge israel forty year .
and he daughter in law , phinehas ' wife , be with child , near to be deliver : and when she hear the tiding that the ark of god be take , and that she father in law and she husband be dead , she bow herself and travail ; for she pain come upon she .
and about the time of she death the woman that stand by she say unto she , fear not ; for thou hast bear a son .
but she answer not , neither do she regard it .
and she name the child ichabod , say , the glory be depart from israel : because the ark of god be take , and because of she father in law and she husband .
and she say , the glory be depart from israel : for the ark of god be take .
and the philistines take the ark of god , and bring it from ebenezer unto ashdod .
when the philistines take the ark of god , they bring it into the house of dagon , and set it by dagon .
and when they of ashdod arise early on the morrow , behold , dagon be fall upon he face to the earth before the ark of the lord .
and they take dagon , and set he in he place again .
and when they arise early on the morrow morning , behold , dagon be fall upon he face to the ground before the ark of the lord ; and the head of dagon and both the palm of he hand be cut off upon the threshold ; only the stump of dagon be leave to he .
therefore neither the priest of dagon , nor any that come into dagon 's house , tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day .
but the hand of the lord be heavy upon they of ashdod , and he destroy they , and smite they with emerod , even ashdod and the coast thereof .
and when the man of ashdod see that it be so , they say , the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with we : for he hand be sore upon we , and upon dagon we god .
they send therefore and gather all the lord of the philistines unto they , and say , what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel ?
and they answer , let the ark of the god of israel be carry about unto gath .
and they carry the ark of the god of israel about thither .
and it be so , that , after they have carry it about , the hand of the lord be against the city with a very great destruction : and he smite the man of the city , both small and great , and they have emerod in they secret part .
therefore they send the ark of god to ekron .
and it come to pass , as the ark of god come to ekron , that the ekronites cry out , say , they have bring about the ark of the god of israel to we , to slay we and we people .
so they send and gather together all the lord of the philistines , and say , send away the ark of the god of israel , and let it go again to he own place , that it slay we not , and we people : for there be a deadly destruction throughout all the city ; the hand of god be very heavy there .
and the man that die not be smite with the emerod : and the cry of the city go up to heaven .
and the ark of the lord be in the country of the philistines seven month .
and the philistines call for the priest and the diviner , say , what shall we do to the ark of the lord ? tell we wherewith we shall send it to he place .
and they say , if ye send away the ark of the god of israel , send it not empty ; but in any wise return he a trespass offering : then ye shall be heal , and it shall be know to you why he hand be not remove from you .
then say they , what shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to he ?
they answer , five golden emerod , and five golden mouse , accord to the number of the lord of the philistines : for one plague be on you all , and on you lord .
wherefore ye shall make image of you emerod , and image of you mouse that mar the land ; and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel : peradventure he will lighten he hand from off you , and from off you god , and from off you land .
wherefore then do ye harden you heart , as the egyptians and pharaoh harden they heart ? when he have work wonderfully among they , do they not let the people go , and they depart ?
now therefore make a new cart , and take two milch kine , on which there have come no yoke , and tie the kine to the cart , and bring they calf home from they :
and take the ark of the lord , and lay it upon the cart ; and put the jewel of gold , which ye return he for a trespass offering , in a coffer by the side thereof ; and send it away , that it may go .
and see , if it goeth up by the way of he own coast to bethshemesh , then he have do we this great evil : but if not , then we shall know that it be not he hand that smite we : it be a chance that happen to we .
and the man do so ; and take two milch kine , and tie they to the cart , and shut up they calf at home :
and they lay the ark of the lord upon the cart , and the coffer with the mouse of gold and the image of they emerod .
and the kine take the straight way to the way of bethshemesh , and go along the highway , low as they go , and turn not aside to the right hand or to the leave ; and the lord of the philistines go after they unto the border of bethshemesh .
and they of bethshemesh be reap they wheat harvest in the valley : and they lift up they eye , and see the ark , and rejoice to see it .
and the cart come into the field of joshua , a bethshemite , and stand there , where there be a great stone : and they cleave the wood of the cart , and offer the kine a burnt offering unto the lord .
and the levites take down the ark of the lord , and the coffer that be with it , wherein the jewel of gold be , and put they on the great stone : and the man of bethshemesh offer burnt offering and sacrifice sacrifice the same day unto the lord .
and when the five lord of the philistines have see it , they return to ekron the same day .
and these be the golden emerod which the philistines return for a trespass offering unto the lord ; for ashdod one , for gaza one , for askelon one , for gath one , for ekron one ;
and the golden mouse , accord to the number of all the city of the philistines belong to the five lord , both of fenced city , and of country village , even unto the great stone of abel , whereon they set down the ark of the lord : which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of joshua , the bethshemite .
and he smite the man of bethshemesh , because they have look into the ark of the lord , even he smite of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten man : and the people lament , because the lord have smite many of the people with a great slaughter .
and the man of bethshemesh say , who be able to stand before this holy lord god ? and to whom shall he go up from we ?
and they send messenger to the inhabitant of kirjathjearim , say , the philistine have bring again the ark of the lord ; come ye down , and fetch it up to you .
and the man of kirjathjearim come , and fetch up the ark of the lord , and bring it into the house of abinadab in the hill , and sanctify eleazar he son to keep the ark of the lord .
and it come to pass , while the ark abode in kirjathjearim , that the time be long ; for it be twenty year : and all the house of israel lament after the lord .
and samuel spake unto all the house of israel , say , if ye do return unto the lord with all you heart , then put away the strange god and ashtaroth from among you , and prepare you heart unto the lord , and serve he only : and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines .
then the child of israel do put away baalim and ashtaroth , and serve the lord only .
and samuel say , gather all israel to mizpeh , and i will pray for you unto the lord .
and they gather together to mizpeh , and draw water , and pour it out before the lord , and fast on that day , and say there , we have sin against the lord .
and samuel judge the child of israel in mizpeh .
and when the philistines hear that the child of israel be gather together to mizpeh , the lord of the philistines go up against israel .
and when the child of israel hear it , they be afraid of the philistines .
and the child of israel say to samuel , cease not to cry unto the lord we god for we , that he will save we out of the hand of the philistines .
and samuel take a suck lamb , and offer it for a burnt offering wholly unto the lord : and samuel cry unto the lord for israel ; and the lord hear he .
and as samuel be offer up the burnt offering , the philistines draw near to battle against israel : but the lord thunder with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines , and discomfited they ; and they be smite before israel .
and the man of israel go out of mizpeh , and pursue the philistines , and smite they , until they come under bethcar .
then samuel take a stone , and set it between mizpeh and shen , and call the name of it ebenezer , say , hitherto have the lord help we .
so the philistines be subdue , and they come no more into the coast of israel : and the hand of the lord be against the philistines all the day of samuel .
and the city which the philistines have take from israel be restore to israel , from ekron even unto gath ; and the coast thereof do israel deliver out of the hand of the philistines .
and there be peace between israel and the amorites .
and samuel judge israel all the day of he life .
and he go from year to year in circuit to bethel , and gilgal , and mizpeh , and judge israel in all those place .
and he return be to ramah ; for there be he house ; and there he judge israel ; and there he build a altar unto the lord .
and it come to pass , when samuel be old , that he make he son judge over israel .
now the name of he firstborn be joel ; and the name of he second , abiah : they be judge in beersheba .
and he son walk not in he way , but turn aside after lucre , and take bribe , and perverted judgment .
then all the elder of israel gather themselves together , and come to samuel unto ramah ,
and say unto he , behold , thou art old , and thy son walk not in thy way : now make we a king to judge we like all the nation .
but the thing displeased samuel , when they say , give we a king to judge we .
and samuel pray unto the lord .
and the lord say unto samuel , hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not reject thee , but they have reject i , that i should not reign over they .
accord to all the work which they have do since the day that i bring they up out of egypt even unto this day , wherewith they have forsake i , and serve other god , so do they also unto thee .
now therefore hearken unto they voice : howbeit yet protest solemnly unto they , and shew they the manner of the king that shall reign over they .
and samuel tell all the word of the lord unto the people that ask of he a king .
and he say , this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take you son , and appoint they for himself , for he chariot , and to be he horseman ; and some shall run before he chariot .
and he will appoint he captain over thousand , and captain over fifty ; and will set they to ear he ground , and to reap he harvest , and to make he instrument of war , and instrument of he chariot .
and he will take you daughter to be confectionary , and to be cook , and to be baker .
and he will take you field , and you vineyard , and you oliveyard , even the best of they , and give they to he servant .
and he will take the tenth of you seed , and of you vineyard , and give to he officer , and to he servant .
and he will take you manservant , and you maidservant , and you goodliest young man , and you ass , and put they to he work .
he will take the tenth of you sheep : and ye shall be he servant .
and ye shall cry out in that day because of you king which ye shall have choose you ; and the lord will not hear you in that day .
nevertheless the people refuse to obey the voice of samuel ; and they say , nay ; but we will have a king over we ;
that we also may be like all the nation ; and that we king may judge we , and go out before we , and fight we battle .
and samuel hear all the word of the people , and he rehearse they in the ear of the lord .
and the lord say to samuel , hearken unto they voice , and make they a king .
and samuel say unto the man of israel , go ye every man unto he city .
now there be a man of benjamin , whose name be kish , the son of abiel , the son of zeror , the son of bechorath , the son of aphiah , a benjamite , a mighty man of power .
and he have a son , whose name be saul , a choice young man , and a goodly : and there be not among the child of israel a goodlier person than he : from he shoulder and upward he be higher than any of the people .
and the ass of kish saul 's father be lose .
and kish say to saul he son , take now one of the servant with thee , and arise , go seek the ass .
and he pass through mount ephraim , and pass through the land of shalisha , but they find they not : then they pass through the land of shalim , and there they be not : and he pass through the land of the benjamites , but they find they not .
and when they be come to the land of zuph , saul say to he servant that be with he , come , and let we return ; lest my father leave care for the ass , and take think for we .
and he say unto he , behold now , there be in this city a man of god , and he be a honourable man ; all that he saith cometh surely to pass : now let we go thither ; peradventure he can shew we we way that we should go .
then say saul to he servant , but , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread be spend in we vessel , and there be not a present to bring to the man of god : what have we ?
and the servant answer saul again , and say , behold , i have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver : that will i give to the man of god , to tell we we way .
( beforetime in israel , when a man go to enquire of god , thus he speak , come , and let we go to the seer : for he that be now call a prophet be beforetime call a seer . )
then say saul to he servant , well say ; come , let we go .
so they go unto the city where the man of god be .
and as they go up the hill to the city , they find young maiden go out to draw water , and say unto they , be the seer here ?
and they answer they , and say , he be ; behold , he be before you : make haste now , for he come to day to the city ; for there be a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place :
as soon as ye be come into the city , ye shall straightway find he , before he go up to the high place to eat : for the people will not eat until he come , because he doth bless the sacrifice ; and afterwards they eat that be bid .
now therefore get you up ; for about this time ye shall find he .
and they go up into the city : and when they be come into the city , behold , samuel come out against they , for to go up to the high place .
now the lord have tell samuel in he ear a day before saul come , say ,
to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out of the land of benjamin , and thou shalt anoint he to be captain over my people israel , that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistines : for i have look upon my people , because they cry be come unto i .
and when samuel see saul , the lord say unto he , behold the man whom i speak to thee of ! this same shall reign over my people .
then saul draw near to samuel in the gate , and say , tell i , i pray thee , where the seer 's house be .
and samuel answer saul , and say , i be the seer : go up before i unto the high place ; for ye shall eat with i to day , and to morrow i will let thee go , and will tell thee all that be in thine heart .
and as for thine ass that be lose three day ago , set not thy mind on they ; for they be find .
and on whom be all the desire of israel ?
be it not on thee , and on all thy father 's house ?
and saul answer and say , be not i a benjamite , of the smallest of the tribe of israel ? and my family the least of all the family of the tribe of benjamin ? wherefore then speakest thou so to i ?
and samuel take saul and he servant , and bring they into the parlour , and make they sit in the chiefest place among they that be bid , which be about thirty person .
and samuel say unto the cook , bring the portion which i give thee , of which i say unto thee , set it by thee .
and the cook take up the shoulder , and that which be upon it , and set it before saul .
and samuel say , behold that which be leave ! set it before thee , and eat : for unto this time have it be keep for thee since i say , i have invite the people .
so saul do eat with samuel that day .
and when they be come down from the high place into the city , samuel communed with saul upon the top of the house .
and they arise early : and it come to pass about the spring of the day , that samuel call saul to the top of the house , say , up , that i may send thee away .
and saul arise , and they go out both of they , he and samuel , abroad .
and as they be go down to the end of the city , samuel say to saul , bid the servant pass on before we , ( and he pass on ) , but stand thou still a while , that i may shew thee the word of god .
then samuel take a vial of oil , and pour it upon he head , and kiss he , and say , be it not because the lord have anointed thee to be captain over he inheritance ?
when thou art depart from i to day , then thou shalt find two man by rachel 's sepulchre in the border of benjamin at zelzah ; and they will say unto thee , the ass which thou wentest to seek be find : and , lo , thy father have leave the care of the ass , and sorroweth for you , say , what shall i do for my son ?
then shalt thou go on forward from thence , and thou shalt come to the plain of tabor , and there shall meet thee three man go up to god to bethel , one carry three kid , and another carry three loaf of bread , and another carry a bottle of wine :
and they will salute thee , and give thee two loaf of bread ; which thou shalt receive of they hand .
after that thou shalt come to the hill of god , where be the garrison of the philistines : and it shall come to pass , when thou art come thither to the city , that thou shalt meet a company of prophet come down from the high place with a psaltery , and a tabret , and a pipe , and a harp , before they ; and they shall prophesy :
and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee , and thou shalt prophesy with they , and shalt be turn into another man .
and let it be , when these sign be come unto thee , that thou do as occasion serve thee ; for god be with thee .
and thou shalt go down before i to gilgal ; and , behold , i will come down unto thee , to offer burnt offering , and to sacrifice sacrifice of peace offering : seven day shalt thou tarry , till i come to thee , and shew thee what thou shalt do .
and it be so , that when he have turn he back to go from samuel , god give he another heart : and all those sign come to pass that day .
and when they come thither to the hill , behold , a company of prophet meet he ; and the spirit of god come upon he , and he prophesy among they .
and it come to pass , when all that know he beforetime saw that , behold , he prophesy among the prophet , then the people say one to another , what be this that be come unto the son of kish ?
be saul also among the prophet ?
and one of the same place answer and say , but who be they father ?
therefore it become a proverb , be saul also among the prophet ?
and when he have make a end of prophesy , he come to the high place .
and saul 's uncle say unto he and to he servant , whither go ye ?
and he say , to seek the ass : and when we see that they be no where , we come to samuel .
and saul 's uncle say , tell i , i pray thee , what samuel say unto you .
and saul say unto he uncle , he tell we plainly that the ass be find .
but of the matter of the kingdom , whereof samuel spake , he tell he not .
and samuel call the people together unto the lord to mizpeh ;
and say unto the child of israel , thus saith the lord god of israel , i bring up israel out of egypt , and deliver you out of the hand of the egyptians , and out of the hand of all kingdom , and of they that oppress you :
and ye have this day reject you god , who himself save you out of all you adversity and you tribulation ; and ye have say unto he , nay , but set a king over we .
now therefore present yourselve before the lord by you tribe , and by you thousand .
and when samuel have cause all the tribe of israel to come near , the tribe of benjamin be take .
when he have cause the tribe of benjamin to come near by they family , the family of matri be take , and saul the son of kish be take : and when they seek he , he could not be find .
therefore they enquire of the lord further , if the man should yet come thither .
and the lord answer , behold , he have hide himself among the stuff .
and they run and fetch he thence : and when he stand among the people , he be higher than any of the people from he shoulder and upward .
and samuel say to all the people , see ye he whom the lord have choose , that there be none like he among all the people ?
and all the people shout , and say , god save the king .
then samuel tell the people the manner of the kingdom , and write it in a book , and lay it up before the lord .
and samuel send all the people away , every man to he house .
and saul also go home to gibeah ; and there go with he a band of man , whose heart god have touch .
but the child of belial say , how shall this man save we ?
and they despise he , and bring he no present .
but he hold he peace .
then nahash the ammonite come up , and encamp against jabeshgilead : and all the man of jabesh say unto nahash , make a covenant with we , and we will serve thee .
and nahash the ammonite answer they , on this condition will i make a covenant with you , that i may thrust out all you right eye , and lay it for a reproach upon all israel .
and the elder of jabesh say unto he , give we seven day ' respite , that we may send messenger unto all the coast of israel : and then , if there be no man to save we , we will come out to thee .
then come the messenger to gibeah of saul , and tell the tiding in the ear of the people : and all the people lift up they voice , and weep .
and , behold , saul come after the herd out of the field ; and saul say , what aileth the people that they weep ?
and they tell he the tiding of the man of jabesh .
and the spirit of god come upon saul when he hear those tiding , and he anger be kindle greatly .
and he take a yoke of ox , and hew they in piece , and send they throughout all the coast of israel by the hand of messenger , say , whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel , so shall it be do unto he ox .
and the fear of the lord fall on the people , and they come out with one consent .
and when he number they in bezek , the child of israel be three hundred thousand , and the man of judah thirty thousand .
and they say unto the messenger that come , thus shall ye say unto the man of jabeshgilead , to morrow , by that time the sun be hot , ye shall have help .
and the messenger come and shew it to the man of jabesh ; and they be glad .
therefore the man of jabesh say , to morrow we will come out unto you , and ye shall do with we all that seemeth good unto you .
and it be so on the morrow , that saul put the people in three company ; and they come into the midst of the host in the morning watch , and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day : and it come to pass , that they which remain be scatter , so that two of they be not leave together .
and the people say unto samuel , who be he that say , shall saul reign over we ? bring the man , that we may put they to death .
and saul say , there shall not a man be put to death this day : for to day the lord have work salvation in israel .
then say samuel to the people , come , and let we go to gilgal , and renew the kingdom there .
and all the people go to gilgal ; and there they make saul king before the lord in gilgal ; and there they sacrifice sacrifice of peace offering before the lord ; and there saul and all the man of israel rejoice greatly .
and samuel say unto all israel , behold , i have hearken unto you voice in all that ye say unto i , and have make a king over you .
and now , behold , the king walketh before you : and i be old and grayhead ; and , behold , my son be with you : and i have walk before you from my childhood unto this day .
behold , here i be : witness against i before the lord , and before he anointed : whose ox have i take ? or whose ass have i take ? or whom have i defraud ? whom have i oppress ? or of whose hand have i receive any bribe to blind mine eye therewith ? and i will restore it you .
and they say , thou hast not defraud we , nor oppressed we , neither hast thou take ought of any man 's hand .
and he say unto they , the lord be witness against you , and he anointed be witness this day , that ye have not find ought in my hand .
and they answer , he be witness .
and samuel say unto the people , it be the lord that advance moses and aaron , and that bring you father up out of the land of egypt .
now therefore stand still , that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous act of the lord , which he do to you and to you father .
when jacob be come into egypt , and you father cry unto the lord , then the lord send moses and aaron , which bring forth you father out of egypt , and make they dwell in this place .
and when they forgat the lord they god , he sell they into the hand of sisera , captain of the host of hazor , and into the hand of the philistines , and into the hand of the king of moab , and they fight against they .
and they cry unto the lord , and say , we have sin , because we have forsake the lord , and have serve baalim and ashtaroth : but now deliver we out of the hand of we enemy , and we will serve thee .
and the lord send jerubbaal , and bedan , and jephthah , and samuel , and deliver you out of the hand of you enemy on every side , and ye dwell safe .
and when ye see that nahash the king of the child of ammon come against you , ye say unto i , nay ; but a king shall reign over we : when the lord you god be you king .
now therefore behold the king whom ye have choose , and whom ye have desire ! and , behold , the lord have set a king over you .
if ye will fear the lord , and serve he , and obey he voice , and not rebel against the commandment of the lord , then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue follow the lord you god :
but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord , but rebel against the commandment of the lord , then shall the hand of the lord be against you , as it be against you father .
now therefore stand and see this great thing , which the lord will do before you eye .
be it not wheat harvest to day ?
i will call unto the lord , and he shall send thunder and rain ; that ye may perceive and see that you wickedness be great , which ye have do in the sight of the lord , in ask you a king .
so samuel call unto the lord ; and the lord send thunder and rain that day : and all the people greatly fear the lord and samuel .
and all the people say unto samuel , pray for thy servant unto the lord thy god , that we die not : for we have add unto all we sin this evil , to ask we a king .
and samuel say unto the people , fear not : ye have do all this wickedness : yet turn not aside from follow the lord , but serve the lord with all you heart ;
and turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after vain thing , which can not profit nor deliver ; for they be vain .
for the lord will not forsake he people for he great name 's sake : because it have pleased the lord to make you he people .
moreover as for i , god forbid that i should sin against the lord in cease to pray for you : but i will teach you the good and the right way :
only fear the lord , and serve he in truth with all you heart : for consider how great thing he have do for you .
but if ye shall still do wickedly , ye shall be consume , both ye and you king .
saul reign one year ; and when he have reign two year over israel ,
saul choose he three thousand man of israel ; whereof two thousand be with saul in michmash and in mount bethel , and a thousand be with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin : and the rest of the people he send every man to he tent .
and jonathan smite the garrison of the philistine that be in geba , and the philistines hear of it .
and saul blow the trumpet throughout all the land , say , let the hebrews hear .
and all israel hear say that saul have smite a garrison of the philistines , and that israel also be have in abomination with the philistines .
and the people be call together after saul to gilgal .
and the philistines gather themselves together to fight with israel , thirty thousand chariot , and six thousand horseman , and people as the sand which be on the sea shore in multitude : and they come up , and pitch in michmash , eastward from bethaven .
when the man of israel see that they be in a strait , ( for the people be distressed , ) then the people do hide themselves in cave , and in thicket , and in rock , and in high place , and in pit .
and some of the hebrews go over jordan to the land of gad and gilead .
as for saul , he be yet in gilgal , and all the people follow he tremble .
and he tarry seven day , accord to the set time that samuel have appoint : but samuel come not to gilgal ; and the people be scatter from he .
and saul say , bring hither a burnt offering to i , and peace offering .
and he offer the burnt offering .
and it come to pass , that as soon as he have make a end of offer the burnt offering , behold , samuel come ; and saul go out to meet he , that he might salute he .
and samuel say , what hast thou do ?
and saul say , because i see that the people be scatter from i , and that thou camest not within the day appoint , and that the philistines gather themselves together at michmash ;
therefore say i , the philistine will come down now upon i to gilgal , and i have not make supplication unto the lord : i force myself therefore , and offer a burnt offering .
and samuel say to saul , thou hast do foolishly : thou hast not keep the commandment of the lord thy god , which he command thee : for now would the lord have establish thy kingdom upon israel for ever .
but now thy kingdom shall not continue : the lord have seek he a man after he own heart , and the lord have command he to be captain over he people , because thou hast not keep that which the lord command thee .
and samuel arise , and gat he up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin .
and saul number the people that be present with he , about six hundred man .
and saul , and jonathan he son , and the people that be present with they , abode in gibeah of benjamin : but the philistines encamp in michmash .
and the spoiler come out of the camp of the philistines in three company : one company turn unto the way that leadeth to ophrah , unto the land of shual :
and another company turn the way to bethhoron : and another company turn to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness .
now there be no smith find throughout all the land of israel : for the philistines say , lest the hebrews make they sword or spear :
but all the israelites go down to the philistines , to sharpen every man he share , and he coulter , and he axe , and he mattock .
yet they have a file for the mattock , and for the coulter , and for the fork , and for the axis , and to sharpen the goad .
so it come to pass in the day of battle , that there be neither sword nor spear find in the hand of any of the people that be with saul and jonathan : but with saul and with jonathan he son be there find .
and the garrison of the philistines go out to the passage of michmash .
now it come to pass upon a day , that jonathan the son of saul say unto the young man that bare he armour , come , and let we go over to the philistines ' garrison , that be on the other side .
but he tell not he father .
and saul tarry in the uttermost part of gibeah under a pomegranate tree which be in migron : and the people that be with he be about six hundred man ;
and ahiah , the son of ahitub , ichabod 's brother , the son of phinehas , the son of eli , the lord 's priest in shiloh , wear a ephod .
and the people know not that jonathan be go .
and between the passage , by which jonathan seek to go over unto the philistines ' garrison , there be a sharp rock on the one side , and a sharp rock on the other side : and the name of the one be bozez , and the name of the other seneh .
the forefront of the one be situate northward over against michmash , and the other southward over against gibeah .
and jonathan say to the young man that bare he armour , come , and let we go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised : it may be that the lord will work for we : for there be no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few .
and he armourbearer say unto he , do all that be in thine heart : turn thee ; behold , i be with thee accord to thy heart .
then say jonathan , behold , we will pass over unto these man , and we will discover ourselves unto they .
if they say thus unto we , tarry until we come to you ; then we will stand still in we place , and will not go up unto they .
but if they say thus , come up unto we ; then we will go up : for the lord have deliver they into we hand : and this shall be a sign unto we .
and both of they discover themselves unto the garrison of the philistines : and the philistines say , behold , the hebrews come forth out of the hole where they have hide themselves .
and the man of the garrison answer jonathan and he armourbearer , and say , come up to we , and we will shew you a thing .
and jonathan say unto he armourbearer , come up after i : for the lord have deliver they into the hand of israel .
and jonathan climb up upon he hand and upon he foot , and he armourbearer after he : and they fall before jonathan ; and he armourbearer slew after he .
and that first slaughter , which jonathan and he armourbearer make , be about twenty man , within as it be a half acre of land , which a yoke of ox might plow .
and there be tremble in the host , in the field , and among all the people : the garrison , and the spoiler , they also tremble , and the earth quake : so it be a very great tremble .
and the watchman of saul in gibeah of benjamin look ; and , behold , the multitude melt away , and they go on beat down one another .
then say saul unto the people that be with he , number now , and see who be go from we .
and when they have number , behold , jonathan and he armourbearer be not there .
and saul say unto ahiah , bring hither the ark of god .
for the ark of god be at that time with the child of israel .
and it come to pass , while saul talk unto the priest , that the noise that be in the host of the philistines go on and increase : and saul say unto the priest , withdraw thine hand .
and saul and all the people that be with he assemble themselves , and they come to the battle : and , behold , every man 's sword be against he fellow , and there be a very great discomfiture .
moreover the hebrews that be with the philistines before that time , which go up with they into the camp from the country round about , even they also turn to be with the israelites that be with saul and jonathan .
likewise all the man of israel which have hide themselves in mount ephraim , when they hear that the philistines flee , even they also follow hard after they in the battle .
so the lord save israel that day : and the battle pass over unto bethaven .
and the man of israel be distressed that day : for saul have adjure the people , say , cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening , that i may be avenge on mine enemy .
so none of the people taste any food .
and all they of the land come to a wood ; and there be honey upon the ground .
and when the people be come into the wood , behold , the honey drop ; but no man put he hand to he mouth : for the people fear the oath .
but jonathan hear not when he father charge the people with the oath : wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that be in he hand , and dip it in a honeycomb , and put he hand to he mouth ; and he eye be enlighten .
then answer one of the people , and say , thy father straitly charge the people with a oath , say , cursed be the man that eateth any food this day .
and the people be faint .
then say jonathan , my father have trouble the land : see , i pray you , how mine eye have be enlighten , because i taste a little of this honey .
how much more , if haply the people have eat freely to day of the spoil of they enemy which they find ? for have there not be now a much greater slaughter among the philistines ?
and they smite the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon : and the people be very faint .
and the people fly upon the spoil , and take sheep , and ox , and calf , and slew they on the ground : and the people do eat they with the blood .
then they tell saul , say , behold , the people sin against the lord , in that they eat with the blood .
and he say , ye have transgress : roll a great stone unto i this day .
and saul say , disperse yourselve among the people , and say unto they , bring i hither every man he ox , and every man he sheep , and slay they here , and eat ; and sin not against the lord in eat with the blood .
and all the people bring every man he ox with he that night , and slew they there .
and saul build a altar unto the lord : the same be the first altar that he build unto the lord .
and saul say , let we go down after the philistine by night , and spoil they until the morning light , and let we not leave a man of they .
and they say , do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee .
then say the priest , let we draw near hither unto god .
and saul ask counsel of god , shall i go down after the philistines ? wilt thou deliver they into the hand of israel ?
but he answer he not that day .
and saul say , draw ye near hither , all the chief of the people : and know and see wherein this sin have be this day .
for , as the lord liveth , which saveth israel , though it be in jonathan my son , he shall surely die .
but there be not a man among all the people that answer he .
then say he unto all israel , be ye on one side , and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side .
and the people say unto saul , do what seemeth good unto thee .
therefore saul say unto the lord god of israel , give a perfect lot .
and saul and jonathan be take : but the people escape .
and saul say , cast lot between i and jonathan my son .
and jonathan be take .
then saul say to jonathan , tell i what thou hast do .
and jonathan tell he , and say , i do but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that be in mine hand , and , lo , i must die .
and saul answer , god do so and more also : for thou shalt surely die , jonathan .
and the people say unto saul , shall jonathan die , who have work this great salvation in israel ?
god forbid : as the lord liveth , there shall not one hair of he head fall to the ground ; for he have work with god this day .
so the people rescue jonathan , that he die not .
then saul go up from follow the philistines : and the philistines go to they own place .
so saul take the kingdom over israel , and fight against all he enemy on every side , against moab , and against the child of ammon , and against edom , and against the king of zobah , and against the philistines : and whithersoever he turn himself , he vex they .
and he gather a host , and smite the amalekites , and deliver israel out of the hand of they that spoil they .
now the son of saul be jonathan , and ishui , and melchishua : and the name of he two daughter be these ; the name of the firstborn merab , and the name of the younger michal :
and the name of saul 's wife be ahinoam , the daughter of ahimaaz : and the name of the captain of he host be abner , the son of ner , saul 's uncle .
and kish be the father of saul ; and ner the father of abner be the son of abiel .
and there be sore war against the philistines all the day of saul : and when saul see any strong man , or any valiant man , he take he unto he .
samuel also say unto saul , the lord send i to anoint thee to be king over he people , over israel : now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the word of the lord .
thus saith the lord of host , i remember that which amalek do to israel , how he lay wait for he in the way , when he come up from egypt .
now go and smite amalek , and utterly destroy all that they have , and spare they not ; but slay both man and woman , infant and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass .
and saul gather the people together , and number they in telaim , two hundred thousand footman , and ten thousand man of judah .
and saul come to a city of amalek , and lay wait in the valley .
and saul say unto the kenites , go , depart , get you down from among the amalekites , lest i destroy you with they : for ye shew kindness to all the child of israel , when they come up out of egypt .
so the kenites depart from among the amalekites .
and saul smite the amalekites from havilah until thou comest to shur , that be over against egypt .
and he take agag the king of the amalekites alive , and utterly destroy all the people with the edge of the sword .
but saul and the people spare agag , and the best of the sheep , and of the ox , and of the fatling , and the lamb , and all that be good , and would not utterly destroy they : but every thing that be vile and refuse , that they destroy utterly .
then come the word of the lord unto samuel , say ,
it repenteth i that i have set up saul to be king : for he be turn back from follow i , and have not perform my commandment .
and it grieve samuel ; and he cry unto the lord all night .
and when samuel rise early to meet saul in the morning , it be tell samuel , say , saul come to carmel , and , behold , he set he up a place , and be go about , and pass on , and go down to gilgal .
and samuel come to saul : and saul say unto he , bless be thou of the lord : i have perform the commandment of the lord .
and samuel say , what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ear , and the lowing of the ox which i hear ?
and saul say , they have bring they from the amalekites : for the people spare the best of the sheep and of the ox , to sacrifice unto the lord thy god ; and the rest we have utterly destroy .
then samuel say unto saul , stay , and i will tell thee what the lord have say to i this night .
and he say unto he , say on .
and samuel say , when thou wast little in thine own sight , wast thou not make the head of the tribe of israel , and the lord anoint thee king over israel ?
and the lord send thee on a journey , and say , go and utterly destroy the sinner the amalekites , and fight against they until they be consume .
wherefore then do thou not obey the voice of the lord , but didst fly upon the spoil , and didst evil in the sight of the lord ?
and saul say unto samuel , yea , i have obey the voice of the lord , and have go the way which the lord send i , and have bring agag the king of amalek , and have utterly destroy the amalekites .
but the people take of the spoil , sheep and ox , the chief of the thing which should have be utterly destroy , to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal .
and samuel say , have the lord as great delight in burnt offering and sacrifice , as in obey the voice of the lord ?
behold , to obey be better than sacrifice , and to hearken than the fat of ram .
for rebellion be as the sin of witchcraft , and stubbornness be as iniquity and idolatry .
because thou hast reject the word of the lord , he have also reject thee from be king .
and saul say unto samuel , i have sin : for i have transgress the commandment of the lord , and thy word : because i fear the people , and obey they voice .
now therefore , i pray thee , pardon my sin , and turn again with i , that i may worship the lord .
and samuel say unto saul , i will not return with thee : for thou hast reject the word of the lord , and the lord have reject thee from be king over israel .
and as samuel turn about to go away , he lay hold upon the skirt of he mantle , and it rent .
and samuel say unto he , the lord have rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day , and have give it to a neighbour of thine , that be better than thou .
and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent : for he be not a man , that he should repent .
then he say , i have sin : yet honour i now , i pray thee , before the elder of my people , and before israel , and turn again with i , that i may worship the lord thy god .
so samuel turn again after saul ; and saul worship the lord .
then say samuel , bring ye hither to i agag the king of the amalekites .
and agag come unto he delicately .
and agag say , surely the bitterness of death be past .
and samuel say , as thy sword have make woman childless , so shall thy mother be childless among woman .
and samuel hew agag in piece before the lord in gilgal .
then samuel go to ramah ; and saul go up to he house to gibeah of saul .
and samuel come no more to see saul until the day of he death : nevertheless samuel mourn for saul : and the lord repent that he have make saul king over israel .
and the lord say unto samuel , how long wilt thou mourn for saul , see i have reject he from reign over israel ? fill thine horn with oil , and go , i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite : for i have provide i a king among he son .
and samuel say , how can i go ? if saul hear it , he will kill i .
and the lord say , take a heifer with thee , and say , i be come to sacrifice to the lord .
and call jesse to the sacrifice , and i will shew thee what thou shalt do : and thou shalt anoint unto i he whom i name unto thee .
and samuel do that which the lord spake , and come to bethlehem .
and the elder of the town tremble at he come , and say , comest thou peaceably ?
and he say , peaceably : i be come to sacrifice unto the lord : sanctify yourselve , and come with i to the sacrifice .
and he sanctify jesse and he son , and call they to the sacrifice .
and it come to pass , when they be come , that he look on eliab , and say , surely the lord 's anointed be before he .
but the lord say unto samuel , look not on he countenance , or on the height of he stature ; because i have refuse he : for the lord seeth not as man seeth ; for man looketh on the outward appearance , but the lord looketh on the heart .
then jesse call abinadab , and make he pass before samuel .
and he say , neither have the lord choose this .
then jesse make shammah to pass by .
and he say , neither have the lord choose this .
again , jesse make seven of he son to pass before samuel .
and samuel say unto jesse , the lord have not choose these .
and samuel say unto jesse , be here all thy child ?
and he say , there remaineth yet the youngest , and , behold , he keepeth the sheep .
and samuel say unto jesse , send and fetch he : for we will not sit down till he come hither .
and he send , and bring he in .
now he be ruddy , and withal of a beautiful countenance , and goodly to look to .
and the lord say , arise , anoint he : for this be he .
then samuel take the horn of oil , and anoint he in the midst of he brethren : and the spirit of the lord come upon david from that day forward .
so samuel rise up , and go to ramah .
but the spirit of the lord depart from saul , and a evil spirit from the lord trouble he .
and saul 's servant say unto he , behold now , a evil spirit from god troubleth thee .
let we lord now command thy servant , which be before thee , to seek out a man , who be a cunning player on a harp : and it shall come to pass , when the evil spirit from god be upon thee , that he shall play with he hand , and thou shalt be well .
and saul say unto he servant , provide i now a man that can play well , and bring he to i .
then answer one of the servant , and say , behold , i have see a son of jesse the bethlehemite , that be cunning in play , and a mighty valiant man , and a man of war , and prudent in matter , and a comely person , and the lord be with he .
wherefore saul send messenger unto jesse , and say , send i david thy son , which be with the sheep .
and jesse take a ass laden with bread , and a bottle of wine , and a kid , and send they by david he son unto saul .
and david come to saul , and stand before he : and he love he greatly ; and he become he armourbearer .
and saul send to jesse , say , let david , i pray thee , stand before i ; for he have find favour in my sight .
and it come to pass , when the evil spirit from god be upon saul , that david take a harp , and play with he hand : so saul be refresh , and be well , and the evil spirit depart from he .
now the philistines gather together they army to battle , and be gather together at shochoh , which belongeth to judah , and pitch between shochoh and azekah , in ephesdammim .
and saul and the man of israel be gather together , and pitch by the valley of elah , and set the battle in array against the philistines .
and the philistines stand on a mountain on the one side , and israel stand on a mountain on the other side : and there be a valley between they .
and there go out a champion out of the camp of the philistines , name goliath , of gath , whose height be six cubit and a span .
and he have a helmet of brass upon he head , and he be arm with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat be five thousand shekel of brass .
and he have greave of brass upon he leg , and a target of brass between he shoulder .
and the staff of he spear be like a weaver 's beam ; and he spear 's head weigh six hundred shekel of iron : and one bear a shield go before he .
and he stand and cry unto the army of israel , and say unto they , why be ye come out to set you battle in array ? be not i a philistine , and ye servant to saul ? choose you a man for you , and let he come down to i .
if he be able to fight with i , and to kill i , then will we be you servant : but if i prevail against he , and kill he , then shall ye be we servant , and serve we .
and the philistine say , i defy the army of israel this day ; give i a man , that we may fight together .
when saul and all israel hear those word of the philistine , they be dismayed , and greatly afraid .
now david be the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah , whose name be jesse ; and he have eight son : and the man go among man for a old man in the day of saul .
and the three eldest son of jesse go and follow saul to the battle : and the name of he three son that go to the battle be eliab the firstborn , and next unto he abinadab , and the third shammah .
and david be the youngest : and the three eldest follow saul .
but david go and return from saul to feed he father 's sheep at bethlehem .
and the philistine draw near morning and evening , and present himself forty day .
and jesse say unto david he son , take now for thy brethren a ephah of this parched corn , and these ten loaf , and run to the camp to thy brethren .
and carry these ten cheese unto the captain of they thousand , and look how thy brethren fare , and take they pledge .
now saul , and they , and all the man of israel , be in the valley of elah , fight with the philistines .
and david rise up early in the morning , and leave the sheep with a keeper , and take , and go , as jesse have command he ; and he come to the trench , as the host be go forth to the fight , and shout for the battle .
for israel and the philistines have put the battle in array , army against army .
and david leave he carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage , and run into the army , and come and salute he brethren .
and as he talk with they , behold , there come up the champion , the philistine of gath , goliath by name , out of the army of the philistines , and spake accord to the same word : and david hear they .
and all the man of israel , when they see the man , flee from he , and be sore afraid .
and the man of israel say , have ye see this man that be come up ? surely to defy israel be he come up : and it shall be , that the man who killeth he , the king will enrich he with great riches , and will give he he daughter , and make he father 's house free in israel .
and david spake to the man that stand by he , say , what shall be do to the man that killeth this philistine , and taketh away the reproach from israel ? for who be this uncircumcised philistine , that he should defy the army of the living god ?
and the people answer he after this manner , say , so shall it be do to the man that killeth he .
and eliab he eldest brother hear when he speak unto the man ; and eliab 's anger be kindle against david , and he say , why camest thou down hither ? and with whom hast thou leave those few sheep in the wilderness ?
i know thy pride , and the naughtiness of thine heart ; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle .
and david say , what have i now do ?
be there not a cause ?
and he turn from he toward another , and spake after the same manner : and the people answer he again after the former manner .
and when the word be hear which david spake , they rehearse they before saul : and he send for he .
and david say to saul , let no man 's heart fail because of he ; thy servant will go and fight with this philistine .
and saul say to david , thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with he : for thou art but a youth , and he a man of war from he youth .
and david say unto saul , thy servant keep he father 's sheep , and there come a lion , and a bear , and take a lamb out of the flock :
and i go out after he , and smite he , and deliver it out of he mouth : and when he arise against i , i catch he by he beard , and smite he , and slew he .
thy servant slew both the lion and the bear : and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of they , see he have defy the army of the living god .
david say moreover , the lord that deliver i out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver i out of the hand of this philistine .
and saul say unto david , go , and the lord be with thee .
and saul armed david with he armour , and he put a helmet of brass upon he head ; also he arm he with a coat of mail .
and david gird he sword upon he armour , and he assay to go ; for he have not prove it .
and david say unto saul , i can not go with these ; for i have not prove they .
and david put they off he .
and he take he staff in he hand , and choose he five smooth stone out of the brook , and put they in a shepherd 's bag which he have , even in a scrip ; and he sling be in he hand : and he draw near to the philistine .
and the philistine come on and draw near unto david ; and the man that bare the shield go before he .
and when the philistine look about , and see david , he disdain he : for he be but a youth , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance .
and the philistine say unto david , be i a dog , that thou comest to i with stave ?
and the philistine curse david by he god .
and the philistine say to david , come to i , and i will give thy flesh unto the fowl of the air , and to the beast of the field .
then say david to the philistine , thou comest to i with a sword , and with a spear , and with a shield : but i come to thee in the name of the lord of host , the god of the army of israel , whom thou hast defy .
this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand ; and i will smite thee , and take thine head from thee ; and i will give the carcase of the host of the philistine this day unto the fowl of the air , and to the wild beast of the earth ; that all the earth may know that there be a god in israel .
and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear : for the battle be the lord 's , and he will give you into we hand .
and it come to pass , when the philistine arise , and come , and draw nigh to meet david , that david hasten , and run toward the army to meet the philistine .
and david put he hand in he bag , and take thence a stone , and slang it , and smite the philistine in he forehead , that the stone sink into he forehead ; and he fall upon he face to the earth .
so david prevail over the philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smite the philistine , and slew he ; but there be no sword in the hand of david .
therefore david run , and stand upon the philistine , and take he sword , and draw it out of the sheath thereof , and slew he , and cut off he head therewith .
and when the philistines see they champion be dead , they flee .
and the man of israel and of judah arise , and shout , and pursue the philistines , until thou come to the valley , and to the gate of ekron .
and the wound of the philistines fall down by the way to shaaraim , even unto gath , and unto ekron .
and the child of israel return from chase after the philistines , and they spoil they tent .
and david take the head of the philistine , and bring it to jerusalem ; but he put he armour in he tent .
and when saul see david go forth against the philistine , he say unto abner , the captain of the host , abner , whose son be this youth ?
and abner say , as thy soul liveth , o king , i can not tell .
and the king say , enquire thou whose son the stripling be .
and as david return from the slaughter of the philistine , abner take he , and bring he before saul with the head of the philistine in he hand .
and saul say to he , whose son art thou , thou young man ?
and david answer , i be the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite .
and it come to pass , when he have make a end of speak unto saul , that the soul of jonathan be knit with the soul of david , and jonathan love he as he own soul .
and saul take he that day , and would let he go no more home to he father 's house .
then jonathan and david make a covenant , because he love he as he own soul .
and jonathan strip himself of the robe that be upon he , and give it to david , and he garment , even to he sword , and to he bow , and to he girdle .
and david go out whithersoever saul send he , and behave himself wisely : and saul set he over the man of war , and he be accept in the sight of all the people , and also in the sight of saul 's servant .
and it come to pass as they come , when david be return from the slaughter of the philistine , that the woman come out of all city of israel , singing and dancing , to meet king saul , with tabret , with joy , and with instrument of musick .
and the woman answer one another as they play , and say , saul have slay he thousand , and david he ten thousand .
and saul be very wroth , and the say displeased he ; and he say , they have ascribe unto david ten thousand , and to i they have ascribe but thousand : and what can he have more but the kingdom ?
and saul eye david from that day and forward .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that the evil spirit from god come upon saul , and he prophesy in the midst of the house : and david play with he hand , as at other time : and there be a javelin in saul 's hand .
and saul cast the javelin ; for he say , i will smite david even to the wall with it .
and david avoid out of he presence twice .
and saul be afraid of david , because the lord be with he , and be depart from saul .
therefore saul remove he from he , and make he he captain over a thousand ; and he go out and come in before the people .
and david behave himself wisely in all he way ; and the lord be with he .
wherefore when saul see that he behave himself very wisely , he be afraid of he .
but all israel and judah love david , because he go out and come in before they .
and saul say to david , behold my elder daughter merab , she will i give thee to wife : only be thou valiant for i , and fight the lord 's battle .
for saul say , let not mine hand be upon he , but let the hand of the philistines be upon he .
and david say unto saul , who be i ? and what be my life , or my father 's family in israel , that i should be son in law to the king ?
but it come to pass at the time when merab saul 's daughter should have be give to david , that she be give unto adriel the meholathite to wife .
and michal saul 's daughter love david : and they tell saul , and the thing pleased he .
and saul say , i will give he she , that she may be a snare to he , and that the hand of the philistines may be against he .
wherefore saul say to david , thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain .
and saul command he servant , say , commune with david secretly , and say , behold , the king have delight in thee , and all he servant love thee : now therefore be the king 's son in law .
and saul 's servant speak those word in the ear of david .
and david say , seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king 's son in law , see that i be a poor man , and lightly esteem ?
and the servant of saul tell he , say , on this manner spake david .
and saul say , thus shall ye say to david , the king desireth not any dowry , but a hundred foreskin of the philistines , to be avenge of the king 's enemy .
but saul think to make david fall by the hand of the philistines .
and when he servant tell david these word , it please david well to be the king 's son in law : and the day be not expire .
wherefore david arise and go , he and he man , and slew of the philistines two hundred man ; and david bring they foreskin , and they give they in full tale to the king , that he might be the king 's son in law .
and saul give he michal he daughter to wife .
and saul see and know that the lord be with david , and that michal saul 's daughter love he .
and saul be yet the more afraid of david ; and saul become david 's enemy continually .
then the prince of the philistines go forth : and it come to pass , after they go forth , that david behave himself more wisely than all the servant of saul ; so that he name be much set by .
and saul speak to jonathan he son , and to all he servant , that they should kill david .
but jonathan saul 's son delighted much in david : and jonathan tell david , say , saul my father seeketh to kill thee : now therefore , i pray thee , take heed to thyself until the morning , and abide in a secret place , and hide thyself :
and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and i will commune with my father of thee ; and what i see , that i will tell thee .
and jonathan speak good of david unto saul he father , and say unto he , let not the king sin against he servant , against david ; because he have not sin against thee , and because he work have be to thee-ward very good :
for he do put he life in he hand , and slew the philistine , and the lord work a great salvation for all israel : thou sawest it , and didst rejoice : wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood , to slay david without a cause ?
and saul hearken unto the voice of jonathan : and saul sware , as the lord liveth , he shall not be slay .
and jonathan call david , and jonathan shew he all those thing .
and jonathan bring david to saul , and he be in he presence , as in time past .
and there be war again : and david go out , and fight with the philistines , and slew they with a great slaughter ; and they flee from he .
and the evil spirit from the lord be upon saul , as he sit in he house with he javelin in he hand : and david play with he hand .
and saul seek to smite david even to the wall with the javelin , but he slip away out of saul 's presence , and he smite the javelin into the wall : and david flee , and escape that night .
saul also send messenger unto david 's house , to watch he , and to slay he in the morning : and michal david 's wife tell he , say , if thou save not thy life to night , to morrow thou shalt be slay .
so michal let david down through a window : and he go , and flee , and escape .
and michal take a image , and lay it in the bed , and put a pillow of goat ' hair for he bolster , and cover it with a cloth .
and when saul send messenger to take david , she say , he be sick .
and saul send the messenger again to see david , say , bring he up to i in the bed , that i may slay he .
and when the messenger be come in , behold , there be a image in the bed , with a pillow of goat ' hair for he bolster .
and saul say unto michal , why hast thou deceive i so , and send away mine enemy , that he be escape ?
and michal answer saul , he say unto i , let i go ; why should i kill thee ?
so david flee , and escape , and come to samuel to ramah , and tell he all that saul have do to he .
and he and samuel go and dwelt in naioth .
and it be tell saul , say , behold , david be at naioth in ramah .
and saul send messenger to take david : and when they see the company of the prophet prophesy , and samuel standing as appoint over they , the spirit of god be upon the messenger of saul , and they also prophesy .
and when it be tell saul , he send other messenger , and they prophesy likewise .
and saul send messenger again the third time , and they prophesy also .
then go he also to ramah , and come to a great well that be in sechu : and he ask and say , where be samuel and david ?
and one say , behold , they be at naioth in ramah .
and he go thither to naioth in ramah : and the spirit of god be upon he also , and he go on , and prophesy , until he come to naioth in ramah .
and he strip off he clothes also , and prophesy before samuel in like manner , and lay down naked all that day and all that night .
wherefore they say , be saul also among the prophet ?
and david flee from naioth in ramah , and come and say before jonathan , what have i do ? what be mine iniquity ? and what be my sin before thy father , that he seeketh my life ?
and he say unto he , god forbid ; thou shalt not die : behold , my father will do nothing either great or small , but that he will shew it i : and why should my father hide this thing from i ? it be not so .
and david sware moreover , and say , thy father certainly knoweth that i have find grace in thine eye ; and he saith , let not jonathan know this , lest he be grieve : but truly as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , there be but a step between i and death .
then say jonathan unto david , whatsoever thy soul desireth , i will even do it for thee .
and david say unto jonathan , behold , to morrow be the new moon , and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat : but let i go , that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even .
if thy father at all miss i , then say , david earnestly ask leave of i that he might run to bethlehem he city : for there be a yearly sacrifice there for all the family .
if he say thus , it be well ; thy servant shall have peace : but if he be very wroth , then be sure that evil be determine by he .
therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant ; for thou hast bring thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee : notwithstanding , if there be in i iniquity , slay i thyself ; for why shouldest thou bring i to thy father ?
and jonathan say , far be it from thee : for if i know certainly that evil be determine by my father to come upon thee , then would not i tell it thee ?
then say david to jonathan , who shall tell i ? or what if thy father answer thee roughly ?
and jonathan say unto david , come , and let we go out into the field .
and they go out both of they into the field .
and jonathan say unto david , o lord god of israel , when i have sound my father about to morrow any time , or the third day , and , behold , if there be good toward david , and i then send not unto thee , and shew it thee ;
the lord do so and much more to jonathan : but if it please my father to do thee evil , then i will shew it thee , and send thee away , that thou mayest go in peace : and the lord be with thee , as he have be with my father .
and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew i the kindness of the lord , that i die not :
but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the lord have cut off the enemy of david every one from the face of the earth .
so jonathan make a covenant with the house of david , say , let the lord even require it at the hand of david 's enemy .
and jonathan cause david to swear again , because he love he : for he love he as he love he own soul .
then jonathan say to david , to morrow be the new moon : and thou shalt be miss , because thy seat will be empty .
and when thou hast stay three day , then thou shalt go down quickly , and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business be in hand , and shalt remain by the stone ezel .
and i will shoot three arrow on the side thereof , as though i shoot at a mark .
and , behold , i will send a lad , say , go , find out the arrow .
if i expressly say unto the lad , behold , the arrow be on this side of thee , take they ; then come thou : for there be peace to thee , and no hurt ; as the lord liveth .
but if i say thus unto the young man , behold , the arrow be beyond thee ; go thy way : for the lord have send thee away .
and as touch the matter which thou and i have speak of , behold , the lord be between thee and i for ever .
so david hide himself in the field : and when the new moon be come , the king sit he down to eat meat .
and the king sit upon he seat , as at other time , even upon a seat by the wall : and jonathan arise , and abner sit by saul 's side , and david 's place be empty .
nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day : for he think , something have befall he , he be not clean ; surely he be not clean .
and it come to pass on the morrow , which be the second day of the month , that david 's place be empty : and saul say unto jonathan he son , wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat , neither yesterday , nor to day ?
and jonathan answer saul , david earnestly ask leave of i to go to bethlehem :
and he say , let i go , i pray thee ; for we family have a sacrifice in the city ; and my brother , he have command i to be there : and now , if i have find favour in thine eye , let i get away , i pray thee , and see my brethren .
therefore he cometh not unto the king 's table .
then saul 's anger be kindle against jonathan , and he say unto he , thou son of the perverse rebellious woman , do not i know that thou hast choose the son of jesse to thine own confusion , and unto the confusion of thy mother 's nakedness ?
for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground , thou shalt not be establish , nor thy kingdom .
wherefore now send and fetch he unto i , for he shall surely die .
and jonathan answer saul he father , and say unto he , wherefore shall he be slay ? what have he do ?
and saul cast a javelin at he to smite he : whereby jonathan know that it be determine of he father to slay david .
so jonathan arise from the table in fierce anger , and do eat no meat the second day of the month : for he be grieve for david , because he father have do he shame .
and it come to pass in the morning , that jonathan go out into the field at the time appoint with david , and a little lad with he .
and he say unto he lad , run , find out now the arrow which i shoot .
and as the lad run , he shoot a arrow beyond he .
and when the lad be come to the place of the arrow which jonathan have shoot , jonathan cry after the lad , and say , be not the arrow beyond thee ?
and jonathan cry after the lad , make speed , haste , stay not .
and jonathan 's lad gather up the arrow , and come to he master .
but the lad know not any thing : only jonathan and david know the matter .
and jonathan give he artillery unto he lad , and say unto he , go , carry they to the city .
and as soon as the lad be go , david arise out of a place toward the south , and fall on he face to the ground , and bow himself three time : and they kiss one another , and weep one with another , until david exceed .
and jonathan say to david , go in peace , forasmuch as we have swear both of we in the name of the lord , say , the lord be between i and thee , and between my seed and thy seed for ever .
and he arise and depart : and jonathan go into the city .
then come david to nob to ahimelech the priest : and ahimelech be afraid at the meeting of david , and say unto he , why art thou alone , and no man with thee ?
and david say unto ahimelech the priest , the king have command i a business , and have say unto i , let no man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee , and what i have command thee : and i have appoint my servant to such and such a place .
now therefore what be under thine hand ? give i five loaf of bread in mine hand , or what there be present .
and the priest answer david , and say , there be no common bread under mine hand , but there be hallowed bread ; if the young man have keep themselves at least from woman .
and david answer the priest , and say unto he , of a truth woman have be keep from we about these three day , since i come out , and the vessel of the young man be holy , and the bread be in a manner common , yea , though it be sanctify this day in the vessel .
so the priest give he hallowed bread : for there be no bread there but the shewbread , that be take from before the lord , to put hot bread in the day when it be take away .
now a certain man of the servant of saul be there that day , detain before the lord ; and he name be doeg , a edomite , the chiefest of the herdman that belong to saul .
and david say unto ahimelech , and be there not here under thine hand spear or sword ? for i have neither bring my sword nor my weapon with i , because the king 's business require haste .
and the priest say , the sword of goliath the philistine , whom thou slewest in the valley of elah , behold , it be here wrap in a cloth behind the ephod : if thou wilt take that , take it : for there be no other save that here .
and david say , there be none like that ; give it i .
and david arise , and flee that day for fear of saul , and go to achish the king of gath .
and the servant of achish say unto he , be not this david the king of the land ? do they not sing one to another of he in dance , say , saul have slay he thousand , and david he ten thousand ?
and david lay up these word in he heart , and be sore afraid of achish the king of gath .
and he change he behaviour before they , and feign himself mad in they hand , and scrabble on the door of the gate , and let he spittle fall down upon he beard .
then say achish unto he servant , lo , ye see the man be mad : wherefore then have ye bring he to i ?
have i need of mad man , that ye have bring this fellow to play the mad man in my presence ? shall this fellow come into my house ?
david therefore depart thence , and escape to the cave adullam : and when he brethren and all he father 's house hear it , they go down thither to he .
and every one that be in distress , and every one that be in debt , and every one that be discontented , gather themselves unto he ; and he become a captain over they : and there be with he about four hundred man .
and david go thence to mizpeh of moab : and he say unto the king of moab , let my father and my mother , i pray thee , come forth , and be with you , till i know what god will do for i .
and he bring they before the king of moab : and they dwell with he all the while that david be in the hold .
and the prophet gad say unto david , abide not in the hold ; depart , and get thee into the land of judah .
then david depart , and come into the forest of hareth .
when saul hear that david be discover , and the man that be with he , ( now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah , have he spear in he hand , and all he servant be stand about he ; )
then saul say unto he servant that stand about he , hear now , ye benjamite ; will the son of jesse give every one of you field and vineyard , and make you all captain of thousand , and captain of hundred ;
that all of you have conspire against i , and there be none that sheweth i that my son have make a league with the son of jesse , and there be none of you that be sorry for i , or sheweth unto i that my son have stir up my servant against i , to lie in wait , as at this day ?
then answer doeg the edomite , which be set over the servant of saul , and say , i see the son of jesse come to nob , to ahimelech the son of ahitub .
and he enquire of the lord for he , and give he victuals , and give he the sword of goliath the philistine .
then the king send to call ahimelech the priest , the son of ahitub , and all he father 's house , the priest that be in nob : and they come all of they to the king .
and saul say , hear now , thou son of ahitub .
and he answer , here i be , my lord .
and saul say unto he , why have ye conspire against i , thou and the son of jesse , in that thou hast give he bread , and a sword , and hast enquire of god for he , that he should rise against i , to lie in wait , as at this day ?
then ahimelech answer the king , and say , and who be so faithful among all thy servant as david , which be the king 's son in law , and goeth at thy bidding , and be honourable in thine house ?
do i then begin to enquire of god for he ? be it far from i : let not the king impute any thing unto he servant , nor to all the house of my father : for thy servant know nothing of all this , less or more .
and the king say , thou shalt surely die , ahimelech , thou , and all thy father 's house .
and the king say unto the footman that stand about he , turn , and slay the priest of the lord : because they hand also be with david , and because they know when he flee , and do not shew it to i .
but the servant of the king would not put forth they hand to fall upon the priest of the lord .
and the king say to doeg , turn thou , and fall upon the priest .
and doeg the edomite turn , and he fall upon the priest , and slew on that day fourscore and five person that do wear a linen ephod .
and nob , the city of the priest , smite he with the edge of the sword , both man and woman , child and suckling , and ox , and ass , and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
and one of the son of ahimelech the son of ahitub , name abiathar , escape , and flee after david .
and abiathar shewed david that saul have slay the lord 's priest .
and david say unto abiathar , i know it that day , when doeg the edomite be there , that he would surely tell saul : i have occasion the death of all the person of thy father 's house .
abide thou with i , fear not : for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life : but with i thou shalt be in safeguard .
then they tell david , say , behold , the philistines fight against keilah , and they rob the threshingfloor .
therefore david enquire of the lord , say , shall i go and smite these philistine ?
and the lord say unto david , go , and smite the philistines , and save keilah .
and david 's man say unto he , behold , we be afraid here in judah : how much more then if we come to keilah against the army of the philistines ?
then david enquire of the lord yet again .
and the lord answer he and say , arise , go down to keilah ; for i will deliver the philistines into thine hand .
so david and he man go to keilah , and fight with the philistines , and bring away they cattle , and smite they with a great slaughter .
so david save the inhabitant of keilah .
and it come to pass , when abiathar the son of ahimelech flee to david to keilah , that he come down with a ephod in he hand .
and it be tell saul that david be come to keilah .
and saul say , god have deliver he into mine hand ; for he be shut in , by enter into a town that have gate and bar .
and saul call all the people together to war , to go down to keilah , to besiege david and he man .
and david know that saul secretly practise mischief against he ; and he say to abiathar the priest , bring hither the ephod .
then say david , o lord god of israel , thy servant have certainly hear that saul seeketh to come to keilah , to destroy the city for my sake .
will the man of keilah deliver i up into he hand ? will saul come down , as thy servant have hear ?
o lord god of israel , i beseech thee , tell thy servant .
and the lord say , he will come down .
then say david , will the man of keilah deliver i and my man into the hand of saul ?
and the lord say , they will deliver thee up .
then david and he man , which be about six hundred , arise and depart out of keilah , and go whithersoever they could go .
and it be tell saul that david be escape from keilah ; and he forbare to go forth .
and david abode in the wilderness in strong hold , and remain in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph .
and saul seek he every day , but god deliver he not into he hand .
and david see that saul be come out to seek he life : and david be in the wilderness of ziph in a wood .
and jonathan saul 's son arise , and go to david into the wood , and strengthen he hand in god .
and he say unto he , fear not : for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee ; and thou shalt be king over israel , and i shall be next unto thee ; and that also saul my father knoweth .
and they two make a covenant before the lord : and david abode in the wood , and jonathan go to he house .
then come up the ziphites to saul to gibeah , say , doth not david hide himself with we in strong hold in the wood , in the hill of hachilah , which be on the south of jeshimon ?
now therefore , o king , come down accord to all the desire of thy soul to come down ; and we part shall be to deliver he into the king 's hand .
and saul say , blessed be ye of the lord ; for ye have compassion on i .
go , i pray you , prepare yet , and know and see he place where he haunt be , and who have see he there : for it be tell i that he dealeth very subtilly .
see therefore , and take knowledge of all the lurk place where he hideth himself , and come ye again to i with the certainty , and i will go with you : and it shall come to pass , if he be in the land , that i will search he out throughout all the thousand of judah .
and they arise , and go to ziph before saul : but david and he man be in the wilderness of maon , in the plain on the south of jeshimon .
saul also and he man go to seek he .
and they tell david : wherefore he come down into a rock , and abode in the wilderness of maon .
and when saul hear that , he pursue after david in the wilderness of maon .
and saul go on this side of the mountain , and david and he man on that side of the mountain : and david make haste to get away for fear of saul ; for saul and he man compass david and he man round about to take they .
but there come a messenger unto saul , say , haste thee , and come ; for the philistines have invade the land .
wherefore saul return from pursue after david , and go against the philistines : therefore they call that place selahammahlekoth .
and david go up from thence , and dwelt in strong hold at engedi .
and it come to pass , when saul be return from follow the philistines , that it be tell he , say , behold , david be in the wilderness of engedi .
then saul take three thousand choose man out of all israel , and go to seek david and he man upon the rock of the wild goat .
and he come to the sheepcote by the way , where be a cave ; and saul go in to cover he foot : and david and he man remain in the side of the cave .
and the man of david say unto he , behold the day of which the lord say unto thee , behold , i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand , that thou mayest do to he as it shall seem good unto thee .
then david arise , and cut off the skirt of saul 's robe privily .
and it come to pass afterward , that david 's heart smite he , because he have cut off saul 's skirt .
and he say unto he man , the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master , the lord 's anointed , to stretch forth mine hand against he , see he be the anointed of the lord .
so david stay he servant with these word , and suffer they not to rise against saul .
but saul rise up out of the cave , and go on he way .
david also arise afterward , and go out of the cave , and cry after saul , say , my lord the king .
and when saul look behind he , david stoop with he face to the earth , and bow himself .
and david say to saul , wherefore hearest thou man 's word , say , behold , david seeketh thy hurt ?
behold , this day thine eye have see how that the lord have deliver thee to day into mine hand in the cave : and some bid i kill thee : but mine eye spare thee ; and i say , i will not put forth mine hand against my lord ; for he be the lord 's anointed .
moreover , my father , see , yea , see the skirt of thy robe in my hand : for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe , and kill thee not , know thou and see that there be neither evil nor transgression in mine hand , and i have not sin against thee ; yet thou huntest my soul to take it .
the lord judge between i and thee , and the lord avenge i of thee : but mine hand shall not be upon thee .
as saith the proverb of the ancient , wickedness proceedeth from the wicked : but mine hand shall not be upon thee .
after whom be the king of israel come out ? after whom dost thou pursue ? after a dead dog , after a flea .
the lord therefore be judge , and judge between i and thee , and see , and plead my cause , and deliver i out of thine hand .
and it come to pass , when david have make a end of speak these word unto saul , that saul say , be this thy voice , my son david ?
and saul lift up he voice , and weep .
and he say to david , thou art more righteous than i : for thou hast reward i good , whereas i have reward thee evil .
and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast deal well with i : forasmuch as when the lord have deliver i into thine hand , thou killedst i not .
for if a man find he enemy , will he let he go well away ? wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast do unto i this day .
and now , behold , i know well that thou shalt surely be king , and that the kingdom of israel shall be establish in thine hand .
swear now therefore unto i by the lord , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after i , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and david sware unto saul .
and saul go home ; but david and he man gat they up unto the hold .
and samuel die ; and all the israelites be gather together , and lament he , and bury he in he house at ramah .
and david arise , and go down to the wilderness of paran .
and there be a man in maon , whose possession be in carmel ; and the man be very great , and he have three thousand sheep , and a thousand goat : and he be shear he sheep in carmel .
now the name of the man be nabal ; and the name of he wife abigail : and she be a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful countenance : but the man be churlish and evil in he doings ; and he be of the house of caleb .
and david hear in the wilderness that nabal do shear he sheep .
and david send out ten young man , and david say unto the young man , get you up to carmel , and go to nabal , and greet he in my name :
and thus shall ye say to he that liveth in prosperity , peace be both to thee , and peace be to thine house , and peace be unto all that thou hast .
and now i have hear that thou hast shearer : now thy shepherd which be with we , we hurt they not , neither be there ought miss unto they , all the while they be in carmel .
ask thy young man , and they will shew thee .
wherefore let the young man find favour in thine eye : for we come in a good day : give , i pray thee , whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servant , and to thy son david .
and when david 's young man come , they speak to nabal accord to all those word in the name of david , and cease .
and nabal answer david 's servant , and say , who be david ? and who be the son of jesse ? there be many servant now a day that break away every man from he master .
shall i then take my bread , and my water , and my flesh that i have kill for my shearer , and give it unto man , whom i know not whence they be ?
so david 's young man turn they way , and go again , and come and tell he all those saying .
and david say unto he man , gird ye on every man he sword .
and they gird on every man he sword ; and david also gird on he sword : and there go up after david about four hundred man ; and two hundred abode by the stuff .
but one of the young man tell abigail , nabal 's wife , say , behold , david send messenger out of the wilderness to salute we master ; and he rail on they .
but the man be very good unto we , and we be not hurt , neither miss we any thing , as long as we be conversant with they , when we be in the field :
they be a wall unto we both by night and day , all the while we be with they keep the sheep .
now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do ; for evil be determine against we master , and against all he household : for he be such a son of belial , that a man can not speak to he .
then abigail make haste , and take two hundred loaf , and two bottle of wine , and five sheep ready dress , and five measure of parched corn , and a hundred cluster of raisin , and two hundred cake of fig , and lay they on ass .
and she say unto she servant , go on before i ; behold , i come after you .
but she tell not she husband nabal .
and it be so , as she ride on the ass , that she come down by the covert of the hill , and , behold , david and he man come down against she ; and she meet they .
now david have say , surely in vain have i keep all that this fellow have in the wilderness , so that nothing be miss of all that pertained unto he : and he have requite i evil for good .
so and more also do god unto the enemy of david , if i leave of all that pertain to he by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall .
and when abigail see david , she hast , and light off the ass , and fall before david on she face , and bow herself to the ground ,
and fall at he foot , and say , upon i , my lord , upon i let this iniquity be : and let thine handmaid , i pray thee , speak in thine audience , and hear the word of thine handmaid .
let not my lord , i pray thee , regard this man of belial , even nabal : for as he name be , so be he ; nabal be he name , and folly be with he : but i thine handmaid see not the young man of my lord , whom thou didst send .
now therefore , my lord , as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , see the lord have withholden thee from come to shed blood , and from avenge thyself with thine own hand , now let thine enemy , and they that seek evil to my lord , be as nabal .
and now this blessing which thine handmaid have bring unto my lord , let it even be give unto the young man that follow my lord .
i pray thee , forgive the trespass of thine handmaid : for the lord will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fighteth the battle of the lord , and evil have not be find in thee all thy day .
yet a man be rise to pursue thee , and to seek thy soul : but the soul of my lord shall be bind in the bundle of life with the lord thy god ; and the soul of thine enemy , they shall he sling out , as out of the middle of a sling .
and it shall come to pass , when the lord shall have do to my lord accord to all the good that he have speak concern thee , and shall have appoint thee ruler over israel ;
that this shall be no grief unto thee , nor offence of heart unto my lord , either that thou hast shed blood causeless , or that my lord have avenge himself : but when the lord shall have deal well with my lord , then remember thine handmaid .
and david say to abigail , blessed be the lord god of israel , which send thee this day to meet i :
and bless be thy advice , and bless be thou , which hast keep i this day from come to shed blood , and from avenge myself with mine own hand .
for in very deed , as the lord god of israel liveth , which have keep i back from hurt thee , except thou hadst hast and come to meet i , surely there have not be leave unto nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall .
so david receive of she hand that which she have bring he , and say unto she , go up in peace to thine house ; see , i have hearken to thy voice , and have accept thy person .
and abigail come to nabal ; and , behold , he hold a feast in he house , like the feast of a king ; and nabal 's heart be merry within he , for he be very drunken : wherefore she tell he nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
but it come to pass in the morning , when the wine be go out of nabal , and he wife have tell he these thing , that he heart die within he , and he become as a stone .
and it come to pass about ten day after , that the lord smite nabal , that he die .
and when david hear that nabal be dead , he say , blessed be the lord , that have plead the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal , and have keep he servant from evil : for the lord have return the wickedness of nabal upon he own head .
and david send and commune with abigail , to take she to he to wife .
and when the servant of david be come to abigail to carmel , they speak unto she , say , david send we unto thee , to take thee to he to wife .
and she arise , and bow herself on she face to the earth , and say , behold , let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the foot of the servant of my lord .
and abigail hast , and arise , and ride upon a ass , with five damsel of hers that go after she ; and she go after the messenger of david , and become he wife .
david also take ahinoam of jezreel ; and they be also both of they he wife .
but saul have give michal he daughter , david 's wife , to phalti the son of laish , which be of gallim .
and the ziphites come unto saul to gibeah , say , doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah , which be before jeshimon ?
then saul arise , and go down to the wilderness of ziph , have three thousand choose man of israel with he , to seek david in the wilderness of ziph .
and saul pitch in the hill of hachilah , which be before jeshimon , by the way .
but david abode in the wilderness , and he see that saul come after he into the wilderness .
david therefore send out spy , and understand that saul be come in very deed .
and david arise , and come to the place where saul have pitch : and david behold the place where saul lay , and abner the son of ner , the captain of he host : and saul lay in the trench , and the people pitch round about he .
then answer david and say to ahimelech the hittite , and to abishai the son of zeruiah , brother to joab , say , who will go down with i to saul to the camp ?
and abishai say , i will go down with thee .
so david and abishai come to the people by night : and , behold , saul lay sleep within the trench , and he spear stick in the ground at he bolster : but abner and the people lay round about he .
then say abishai to david , god have deliver thine enemy into thine hand this day : now therefore let i smite he , i pray thee , with the spear even to the earth at once , and i will not smite he the second time .
and david say to abishai , destroy he not : for who can stretch forth he hand against the lord 's anointed , and be guiltless ?
david say furthermore , as the lord liveth , the lord shall smite he ; or he day shall come to die ; or he shall descend into battle , and perish .
the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lord 's anoint : but , i pray thee , take thou now the spear that be at he bolster , and the cruse of water , and let we go .
so david take the spear and the cruse of water from saul 's bolster ; and they gat they away , and no man see it , nor know it , neither awake : for they be all asleep ; because a deep sleep from the lord be fall upon they .
then david go over to the other side , and stand on the top of a hill afar off ; a great space be between they :
and david cry to the people , and to abner the son of ner , say , answerest thou not , abner ?
then abner answer and say , who art thou that criest to the king ?
and david say to abner , art not thou a valiant man ? and who be like to thee in israel ? wherefore then hast thou not keep thy lord the king ? for there come one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord .
this thing be not good that thou hast do .
as the lord liveth , ye be worthy to die , because ye have not keep you master , the lord 's anointed .
and now see where the king 's spear be , and the cruse of water that be at he bolster .
and saul know david 's voice , and say , be this thy voice , my son david ?
and david say , it be my voice , my lord , o king .
and he say , wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after he servant ? for what have i do ? or what evil be in mine hand ?
now therefore , i pray thee , let my lord the king hear the word of he servant .
if the lord have stir thee up against i , let he accept a offering : but if they be the child of man , curse be they before the lord ; for they have drive i out this day from abide in the inheritance of the lord , say , go , serve other god .
now therefore , let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the lord : for the king of israel be come out to seek a flea , as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountain .
then say saul , i have sin : return , my son david : for i will no more do thee harm , because my soul be precious in thine eye this day : behold , i have play the fool , and have err exceedingly .
and david answer and say , behold the king 's spear ! and let one of the young man come over and fetch it .
the lord render to every man he righteousness and he faithfulness ; for the lord deliver thee into my hand to day , but i would not stretch forth mine hand against the lord 's anointed .
and , behold , as thy life be much set by this day in mine eye , so let my life be much set by in the eye of the lord , and let he deliver i out of all tribulation .
then saul say to david , blessed be thou , my son david : thou shalt both do great thing , and also shalt still prevail .
so david go on he way , and saul return to he place .
and david say in he heart , i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul : there be nothing better for i than that i should speedily escape into the land of the philistines ; and saul shall despair of i , to seek i any more in any coast of israel : so shall i escape out of he hand .
and david arise , and he pass over with the six hundred man that be with he unto achish , the son of maoch , king of gath .
and david dwelt with achish at gath , he and he man , every man with he household , even david with he two wife , ahinoam the jezreelitess , and abigail the carmelitess , nabal 's wife .
and it be tell saul that david be flee to gath : and he seek no more again for he .
and david say unto achish , if i have now find grace in thine eye , let they give i a place in some town in the country , that i may dwell there : for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee ?
then achish give he ziklag that day : wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the king of judah unto this day .
and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistine be a full year and four month .
and david and he man go up , and invade the geshurites , and the gezrites , and the amalekites : for those nation be of old the inhabitant of the land , as thou goest to shur , even unto the land of egypt .
and david smite the land , and leave neither man nor woman alive , and take away the sheep , and the ox , and the ass , and the camel , and the apparel , and return , and come to achish .
and achish say , whither have ye make a road to day ?
and david say , against the south of judah , and against the south of the jerahmeelites , and against the south of the kenites .
and david save neither man nor woman alive , to bring tiding to gath , say , lest they should tell on we , say , so do david , and so will be he manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the philistines .
and achish believe david , say , he have make he people israel utterly to abhor he ; therefore he shall be my servant for ever .
and it come to pass in those day , that the philistines gather they army together for warfare , to fight with israel .
and achish say unto david , know thou assuredly , that thou shalt go out with i to battle , thou and thy man .
and david say to achish , surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do .
and achish say to david , therefore will i make thee keeper of mine head for ever .
now samuel be dead , and all israel have lament he , and bury he in ramah , even in he own city .
and saul have put away those that have familiar spirit , and the wizard , out of the land .
and the philistines gather themselves together , and come and pitch in shunem : and saul gather all israel together , and they pitch in gilboa .
and when saul see the host of the philistines , he be afraid , and he heart greatly tremble .
and when saul enquire of the lord , the lord answer he not , neither by dream , nor by urim , nor by prophet .
then say saul unto he servant , seek i a woman that have a familiar spirit , that i may go to she , and enquire of she .
and he servant say to he , behold , there be a woman that have a familiar spirit at endor .
and saul disguise himself , and put on other raiment , and he go , and two man with he , and they come to the woman by night : and he say , i pray thee , divine unto i by the familiar spirit , and bring i he up , whom i shall name unto thee .
and the woman say unto he , behold , thou knowest what saul have do , how he have cut off those that have familiar spirit , and the wizard , out of the land : wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life , to cause i to die ?
and saul sware to she by the lord , say , as the lord liveth , there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing .
then say the woman , whom shall i bring up unto thee ?
and he say , bring i up samuel .
and when the woman see samuel , she cry with a loud voice : and the woman spake to saul , say , why hast thou deceive i ? for thou art saul .
and the king say unto she , be not afraid : for what sawest thou ?
and the woman say unto saul , i see god ascend out of the earth .
and he say unto she , what form be he of ?
and she say , a old man cometh up ; and he be cover with a mantle .
and saul perceive that it be samuel , and he stoop with he face to the ground , and bow himself .
and samuel say to saul , why hast thou disquiet i , to bring i up ?
and saul answer , i be sore distressed ; for the philistine make war against i , and god be depart from i , and answereth i no more , neither by prophet , nor by dream : therefore i have call thee , that thou mayest make known unto i what i shall do .
then say samuel , wherefore then dost thou ask of i , see the lord be depart from thee , and be become thine enemy ?
and the lord have do to he , as he speak by i : for the lord have rent the kingdom out of thine hand , and give it to thy neighbour , even to david :
because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord , nor executedst he fierce wrath upon amalek , therefore have the lord do this thing unto thee this day .
moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the hand of the philistines : and to morrow shalt thou and thy son be with i : the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of the philistines .
then saul fall straightway all along on the earth , and be sore afraid , because of the word of samuel : and there be no strength in he ; for he have eat no bread all the day , nor all the night .
and the woman come unto saul , and see that he be sore troubled , and say unto he , behold , thine handmaid have obey thy voice , and i have put my life in my hand , and have hearken unto thy word which thou spakest unto i .
now therefore , i pray thee , hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid , and let i set a morsel of bread before thee ; and eat , that thou mayest have strength , when thou goest on thy way .
but he refuse , and say , i will not eat .
but he servant , together with the woman , compel he ; and he hearken unto they voice .
so he arise from the earth , and sit upon the bed .
and the woman have a fat calf in the house ; and she hast , and kill it , and take flour , and knead it , and do bake unleavened bread thereof :
and she bring it before saul , and before he servant ; and they do eat .
then they rise up , and go away that night .
now the philistines gather together all they army to aphek : and the israelites pitch by a fountain which be in jezreel .
and the lord of the philistines pass on by hundred , and by thousand : but david and he man pass on in the rereward with achish .
then say the prince of the philistines , what do these hebrew here ?
and achish say unto the prince of the philistines , be not this david , the servant of saul the king of israel , which have be with i these day , or these year , and i have find no fault in he since he fall unto i unto this day ?
and the prince of the philistines be wroth with he ; and the prince of the philistines say unto he , make this fellow return , that he may go again to he place which thou hast appoint he , and let he not go down with we to battle , lest in the battle he be a adversary to we : for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto he master ? should it not be with the head of these man ?
be not this david , of whom they sing one to another in dance , say , saul slew he thousand , and david he ten thousand ?
then achish call david , and say unto he , surely , as the lord liveth , thou hast be upright , and thy go out and thy come in with i in the host be good in my sight : for i have not find evil in thee since the day of thy come unto i unto this day : nevertheless the lord favour thee not .
wherefore now return , and go in peace , that thou displease not the lord of the philistines .
and david say unto achish , but what have i do ? and what hast thou find in thy servant so long as i have be with thee unto this day , that i may not go fight against the enemy of my lord the king ?
and achish answer and say to david , i know that thou art good in my sight , as a angel of god : notwithstanding the prince of the philistines have say , he shall not go up with we to the battle .
wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master 's servant that be come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
so david and he man rise up early to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the philistines .
and the philistines go up to jezreel .
and it come to pass , when david and he man be come to ziklag on the third day , that the amalekites have invade the south , and ziklag , and smitten ziklag , and burn it with fire ;
and have take the woman captive , that be therein : they slew not any , either great or small , but carry they away , and go on they way .
so david and he man come to the city , and , behold , it be burn with fire ; and they wife , and they son , and they daughter , be take captive .
then david and the people that be with he lift up they voice and weep , until they have no more power to weep .
and david 's two wife be take captive , ahinoam the jezreelitess , and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite .
and david be greatly distressed ; for the people speak of stone he , because the soul of all the people be grieve , every man for he son and for he daughter : but david encourage himself in the lord he god .
and david say to abiathar the priest , ahimelech 's son , i pray thee , bring i hither the ephod .
and abiathar bring thither the ephod to david .
and david enquire at the lord , say , shall i pursue after this troop ? shall i overtake they ?
and he answer he , pursue : for thou shalt surely overtake they , and without fail recover all .
so david go , he and the six hundred man that be with he , and come to the brook besor , where those that be leave behind stay .
but david pursue , he and four hundred man : for two hundred abode behind , which be so faint that they could not go over the brook besor .
and they find a egyptian in the field , and bring he to david , and give he bread , and he do eat ; and they make he drink water ;
and they give he a piece of a cake of fig , and two cluster of raisin : and when he have eat , he spirit come again to he : for he have eat no bread , nor drunk any water , three day and three night .
and david say unto he , to whom belongest thou ? and whence art thou ?
and he say , i be a young man of egypt , servant to a amalekite ; and my master leave i , because three day agone i fall sick .
we make a invasion upon the south of the cherethites , and upon the coast which belongeth to judah , and upon the south of caleb ; and we burn ziklag with fire .
and david say to he , canst thou bring i down to this company ?
and he say , swear unto i by god , that thou wilt neither kill i , nor deliver i into the hand of my master , and i will bring thee down to this company .
and when he have bring he down , behold , they be spread abroad upon all the earth , eating and drinking , and dancing , because of all the great spoil that they have take out of the land of the philistines , and out of the land of judah .
and david smite they from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day : and there escape not a man of they , save four hundred young man , which ride upon camel , and flee .
and david recover all that the amalekites have carry away : and david rescue he two wife .
and there be nothing lack to they , neither small nor great , neither son nor daughter , neither spoil , nor any thing that they have take to they : david recover all .
and david take all the flock and the herd , which they drave before those other cattle , and say , this be david 's spoil .
and david come to the two hundred man , which be so faint that they could not follow david , whom they have make also to abide at the brook besor : and they go forth to meet david , and to meet the people that be with he : and when david come near to the people , he salute they .
then answer all the wicked man and man of belial , of those that go with david , and say , because they go not with we , we will not give they ought of the spoil that we have recover , save to every man he wife and he child , that they may lead they away , and depart .
then say david , ye shall not do so , my brethren , with that which the lord have give we , who have preserved we , and deliver the company that come against we into we hand .
for who will hearken unto you in this matter ? but as he part be that goeth down to the battle , so shall he part be that tarrieth by the stuff : they shall part alike .
and it be so from that day forward , that he make it a statute and a ordinance for israel unto this day .
and when david come to ziklag , he send of the spoil unto the elder of judah , even to he friend , say , behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemy of the lord ;
to they which be in bethel , and to they which be in south ramoth , and to they which be in jattir ,
and to they which be in aroer , and to they which be in siphmoth , and to they which be in eshtemoa ,
and to they which be in rachal , and to they which be in the city of the jerahmeelites , and to they which be in the city of the kenites ,
and to they which be in hormah , and to they which be in chorashan , and to they which be in athach ,
and to they which be in hebron , and to all the place where david himself and he man be wont to haunt .
now the philistines fight against israel : and the man of israel flee from before the philistines , and fall down slay in mount gilboa .
and the philistines follow hard upon saul and upon he son ; and the philistines slew jonathan , and abinadab , and melchishua , saul 's son .
and the battle go sore against saul , and the archer hit he ; and he be sore wound of the archer .
then say saul unto he armourbearer , draw thy sword , and thrust i through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust i through , and abuse i .
but he armourbearer would not ; for he be sore afraid .
therefore saul take a sword , and fall upon it .
and when he armourbearer see that saul be dead , he fall likewise upon he sword , and die with he .
so saul die , and he three son , and he armourbearer , and all he man , that same day together .
and when the man of israel that be on the other side of the valley , and they that be on the other side jordan , see that the man of israel flee , and that saul and he son be dead , they forsake the city , and flee ; and the philistines come and dwelt in they .
and it come to pass on the morrow , when the philistines come to strip the slay , that they find saul and he three son fall in mount gilboa .
and they cut off he head , and strip off he armour , and send into the land of the philistine round about , to publish it in the house of they idol , and among the people .
and they put he armour in the house of ashtaroth : and they fasten he body to the wall of bethshan .
and when the inhabitant of jabeshgilead hear of that which the philistines have do to saul ;
all the valiant man arise , and go all night , and take the body of saul and the body of he son from the wall of bethshan , and come to jabesh , and burn they there .
and they take they bone , and bury they under a tree at jabesh , and fast seven day .
now it come to pass after the death of saul , when david be return from the slaughter of the amalekites , and david have abode two day in ziklag ;
it come even to pass on the third day , that , behold , a man come out of the camp from saul with he clothes rent , and earth upon he head : and so it be , when he come to david , that he fall to the earth , and do obeisance .
and david say unto he , from whence comest thou ?
and he say unto he , out of the camp of israel be i escape .
and david say unto he , how go the matter ?
i pray thee , tell i .
and he answer , that the people be flee from the battle , and many of the people also be fall and dead ; and saul and jonathan he son be dead also .
and david say unto the young man that tell he , how knowest thou that saul and jonathan he son be dead ?
and the young man that tell he say , as i happen by chance upon mount gilboa , behold , saul lean upon he spear ; and , lo , the chariot and horseman follow hard after he .
and when he look behind he , he see i , and call unto i .
and i answer , here be i.
and he say unto i , who art thou ?
and i answer he , i be a amalekite .
he say unto i again , stand , i pray thee , upon i , and slay i : for anguish be come upon i , because my life be yet whole in i .
so i stand upon he , and slew he , because i be sure that he could not live after that he be fall : and i take the crown that be upon he head , and the bracelet that be on he arm , and have bring they hither unto my lord .
then david take hold on he clothes , and rent they ; and likewise all the man that be with he :
and they mourn , and weep , and fast until even , for saul , and for jonathan he son , and for the people of the lord , and for the house of israel ; because they be fall by the sword .
and david say unto the young man that tell he , whence art thou ?
and he answer , i be the son of a stranger , a amalekite .
and david say unto he , how wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the lord 's anoint ?
and david call one of the young man , and say , go near , and fall upon he .
and he smite he that he die .
and david say unto he , thy blood be upon thy head ; for thy mouth have testify against thee , say , i have slay the lord 's anointed .
and david lament with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan he son :
( also he bid they teach the child of judah the use of the bow : behold , it be write in the book of jasher . )
the beauty of israel be slay upon thy high place : how be the mighty fall !
tell it not in gath , publish it not in the street of askelon ; lest the daughter of the philistine rejoice , lest the daughter of the uncircumcised triumph .
ye mountain of gilboa , let there be no dew , neither let there be rain , upon you , nor field of offering : for there the shield of the mighty be vilely cast away , the shield of saul , as though he have not be anoint with oil .
from the blood of the slay , from the fat of the mighty , the bow of jonathan turn not back , and the sword of saul return not empty .
saul and jonathan be lovely and pleasant in they life , and in they death they be not divide : they be swifter than eagle , they be stronger than lion .
ye daughter of israel , weep over saul , who clothe you in scarlet , with other delight , who put on ornament of gold upon you apparel .
how be the mighty fall in the midst of the battle !
o jonathan , thou wast slay in thine high place .
i be distressed for thee , my brother jonathan : very pleasant hast thou be unto i : thy love to i be wonderful , pass the love of woman .
how be the mighty fall , and the weapon of war perish !
and it come to pass after this , that david enquire of the lord , say , shall i go up into any of the city of judah ?
and the lord say unto he , go up .
and david say , whither shall i go up ?
and he say , unto hebron .
so david go up thither , and he two wife also , ahinoam the jezreelitess , and abigail nabal 's wife the carmelite .
and he man that be with he do david bring up , every man with he household : and they dwell in the city of hebron .
and the man of judah come , and there they anoint david king over the house of judah .
and they tell david , say , that the man of jabeshgilead be they that bury saul .
and david send messenger unto the man of jabeshgilead , and say unto they , bless be ye of the lord , that ye have shew this kindness unto you lord , even unto saul , and have bury he .
and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you : and i also will requite you this kindness , because ye have do this thing .
therefore now let you hand be strengthen , and be ye valiant : for you master saul be dead , and also the house of judah have anoint i king over they .
but abner the son of ner , captain of saul 's host , take ishbosheth the son of saul , and bring he over to mahanaim ;
and make he king over gilead , and over the ashurites , and over jezreel , and over ephraim , and over benjamin , and over all israel .
ishbosheth saul 's son be forty year old when he begin to reign over israel , and reign two year .
but the house of judah follow david .
and the time that david be king in hebron over the house of judah be seven year and six month .
and abner the son of ner , and the servant of ishbosheth the son of saul , go out from mahanaim to gibeon .
and joab the son of zeruiah , and the servant of david , go out , and meet together by the pool of gibeon : and they sit down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
and abner say to joab , let the young man now arise , and play before we .
and joab say , let they arise .
then there arise and go over by number twelve of benjamin , which pertain to ishbosheth the son of saul , and twelve of the servant of david .
and they catch every one he fellow by the head , and thrust he sword in he fellow 's side ; so they fall down together : wherefore that place be call helkathhazzurim , which be in gibeon .
and there be a very sore battle that day ; and abner be beat , and the man of israel , before the servant of david .
and there be three son of zeruiah there , joab , and abishai , and asahel : and asahel be as light of foot as a wild roe .
and asahel pursue after abner ; and in go he turn not to the right hand nor to the leave from follow abner .
then abner look behind he , and say , art thou asahel ?
and he answer , i be .
and abner say to he , turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left , and lay thee hold on one of the young man , and take thee he armour .
but asahel would not turn aside from follow of he .
and abner say again to asahel , turn thee aside from follow i : wherefore should i smite thee to the ground ? how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother ?
howbeit he refuse to turn aside : wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smite he under the fifth rib , that the spear come out behind he ; and he fall down there , and die in the same place : and it come to pass , that as many as come to the place where asahel fall down and die stand still .
joab also and abishaus pursue after abner : and the sun go down when they be come to the hill of ammah , that lieth before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon .
and the child of benjamin gather themselves together after abner , and become one troop , and stand on the top of a hill .
then abner call to joab , and say , shall the sword devour for ever ? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end ? how long shall it be then , ere thou bid the people return from follow they brethren ?
and joab say , as god liveth , unless thou hadst speak , surely then in the morning the people have go up every one from follow he brother .
so joab blow a trumpet , and all the people stand still , and pursue after israel no more , neither fight they any more .
and abner and he man walk all that night through the plain , and pass over jordan , and go through all bithron , and they come to mahanaim .
and joab return from follow abner : and when he have gather all the people together , there lack of david 's servant nineteen man and asahel .
but the servant of david have smite of benjamin , and of abner 's man , so that three hundred and threescore man die .
and they take up asahel , and bury he in the sepulchre of he father , which be in bethlehem .
and joab and he man go all night , and they come to hebron at break of day .
now there be long war between the house of saul and the house of david : but david wax stronger and stronger , and the house of saul wax weaker and weaker .
and unto david be son bear in hebron : and he firstborn be amnon , of ahinoam the jezreelitess ;
and he second , chileab , of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite ; and the third , absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur ;
and the fourth , adonijah the son of haggith ; and the fifth , shephatiah the son of abital ;
and the sixth , ithream , by eglah david 's wife .
these be bear to david in hebron .
and it come to pass , while there be war between the house of saul and the house of david , that abner make himself strong for the house of saul .
and saul have a concubine , whose name be rizpah , the daughter of aiah : and ishbosheth say to abner , wherefore hast thou go in unto my father 's concubine ?
then be abner very wroth for the word of ishbosheth , and say , be i a dog 's head , which against judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of saul thy father , to he brethren , and to he friend , and have not deliver thee into the hand of david , that thou chargest i to day with a fault concern this woman ?
so do god to abner , and more also , except , as the lord have swear to david , even so i do to he ;
to translate the kingdom from the house of saul , and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah , from dan even to beersheba .
and he could not answer abner a word again , because he fear he .
and abner send messenger to david on he behalf , say , whose be the land ? say also , make thy league with i , and , behold , my hand shall be with thee , to bring about all israel unto thee .
and he say , well ; i will make a league with thee : but one thing i require of thee , that be , thou shalt not see my face , except thou first bring michal saul 's daughter , when thou comest to see my face .
and david send messenger to ishbosheth saul 's son , say , deliver i my wife michal , which i espouse to i for a hundred foreskin of the philistines .
and ishbosheth send , and take she from she husband , even from phaltiel the son of laish .
and she husband go with she along weep behind she to bahurim .
then say abner unto he , go , return .
and he return .
and abner have communication with the elder of israel , say , ye seek for david in time past to be king over you :
now then do it : for the lord have speak of david , say , by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines , and out of the hand of all they enemy .
and abner also speak in the ear of benjamin : and abner go also to speak in the ear of david in hebron all that seem good to israel , and that seem good to the whole house of benjamin .
so abner come to david to hebron , and twenty man with he .
and david make abner and the man that be with he a feast .
and abner say unto david , i will arise and go , and will gather all israel unto my lord the king , that they may make a league with thee , and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth .
and david send abner away ; and he go in peace .
and , behold , the servant of david and joab come from pursue a troop , and bring in a great spoil with they : but abner be not with david in hebron ; for he have send he away , and he be go in peace .
when joab and all the host that be with he be come , they tell joab , say , abner the son of ner come to the king , and he have send he away , and he be go in peace .
then joab come to the king , and say , what hast thou do ? behold , abner come unto thee ; why be it that thou hast send he away , and he be quite go ?
thou knowest abner the son of ner , that he come to deceive thee , and to know thy go out and thy come in , and to know all that thou doest .
and when joab be come out from david , he send messenger after abner , which bring he again from the well of sirah : but david know it not .
and when abner be return to hebron , joab take he aside in the gate to speak with he quietly , and smite he there under the fifth rib , that he die , for the blood of asahel he brother .
and afterward when david hear it , he say , i and my kingdom be guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of ner :
let it rest on the head of joab , and on all he father 's house ; and let there not fail from the house of joab one that have a issue , or that be a leper , or that leaneth on a staff , or that falleth on the sword , or that lacketh bread .
so joab and abishai he brother slew abner , because he have slay they brother asahel at gibeon in the battle .
and david say to joab , and to all the people that be with he , rend you clothes , and gird you with sackcloth , and mourn before abner .
and king david himself follow the bier .
and they bury abner in hebron : and the king lift up he voice , and weep at the grave of abner ; and all the people weep .
and the king lament over abner , and say , die abner as a fool dieth ?
thy hand be not bind , nor thy foot put into fetter : as a man falleth before wicked man , so fellest thou .
and all the people weep again over he .
and when all the people come to cause david to eat meat while it be yet day , david sware , say , so do god to i , and more also , if i taste bread , or ought else , till the sun be down .
and all the people take notice of it , and it please they : as whatsoever the king do pleased all the people .
for all the people and all israel understand that day that it be not of the king to slay abner the son of ner .
and the king say unto he servant , know ye not that there be a prince and a great man fall this day in israel ?
and i be this day weak , though anointed king ; and these man the son of zeruiah be too hard for i : the lord shall reward the doer of evil accord to he wickedness .
and when saul 's son hear that abner be dead in hebron , he hand be feeble , and all the israelites be trouble .
and saul 's son have two man that be captain of band : the name of the one be baanah , and the name of the other rechab , the son of rimmon a beerothite , of the child of benjamin : ( for beeroth also be reckon to benjamin .
and the beerothites flee to gittaim , and be sojourner there until this day . )
and jonathan , saul 's son , have a son that be lame of he foot .
he be five year old when the tiding come of saul and jonathan out of jezreel , and he nurse take he up , and flee : and it come to pass , as she make haste to flee , that he fall , and become lame .
and he name be mephibosheth .
and the son of rimmon the beerothite , rechab and baanah , go , and come about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth , who lay on a bed at noon .
and they come thither into the midst of the house , as though they would have fetch wheat ; and they smite he under the fifth rib : and rechab and baanah he brother escape .
for when they come into the house , he lay on he bed in he bedchamber , and they smite he , and slew he , and behead he , and take he head , and gat they away through the plain all night .
and they bring the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron , and say to the king , behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine enemy , which seek thy life ; and the lord have avenge my lord the king this day of saul , and of he seed .
and david answer rechab and baanah he brother , the son of rimmon the beerothite , and say unto they , as the lord liveth , who have redeem my soul out of all adversity ,
when one tell i , say , behold , saul be dead , think to have bring good tiding , i take hold of he , and slew he in ziklag , who think that i would have give he a reward for he tiding :
how much more , when wicked man have slay a righteous person in he own house upon he bed ? shall i not therefore now require he blood of you hand , and take you away from the earth ?
and david command he young man , and they slew they , and cut off they hand and they foot , and hang they up over the pool in hebron .
but they take the head of ishbosheth , and bury it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron .
then come all the tribe of israel to david unto hebron , and spake , say , behold , we be thy bone and thy flesh .
also in time past , when saul be king over we , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel : and the lord say to thee , thou shalt feed my people israel , and thou shalt be a captain over israel .
so all the elder of israel come to the king to hebron ; and king david make a league with they in hebron before the lord : and they anoint david king over israel .
david be thirty year old when he begin to reign , and he reign forty year .
in hebron he reign over judah seven year and six month : and in jerusalem he reign thirty and three year over all israel and judah .
and the king and he man go to jerusalem unto the jebusites , the inhabitant of the land : which speak unto david , say , except thou take away the blind and the lame , thou shalt not come in hither : thinking , david can not come in hither .
nevertheless david take the strong hold of zion : the same be the city of david .
and david say on that day , whosoever getteth up to the gutter , and smiteth the jebusites , and the lame and the blind , that be hate of david 's soul , he shall be chief and captain .
wherefore they say , the blind and the lame shall not come into the house .
so david dwelt in the fort , and call it the city of david .
and david build round about from millo and inward .
and david go on , and grow great , and the lord god of host be with he .
and hiram king of tyre send messenger to david , and cedar tree , and carpenter , and mason : and they build david a house .
and david perceive that the lord have establish he king over israel , and that he have exalt he kingdom for he people israel 's sake .
and david take he more concubine and wife out of jerusalem , after he be come from hebron : and there be yet son and daughter bear to david .
and these be the name of those that be bear unto he in jerusalem ; shammuah , and shobab , and nathan , and solomon ,
ibhar also , and elishua , and nepheg , and japhia ,
and elishama , and eliada , and eliphalet .
but when the philistines hear that they have anoint david king over israel , all the philistines come up to seek david ; and david hear of it , and go down to the hold .
the philistine also come and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim .
and david enquire of the lord , say , shall i go up to the philistines ? wilt thou deliver they into mine hand ?
and the lord say unto david , go up : for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into thine hand .
and david come to baalperazim , and david smite they there , and say , the lord have broken forth upon mine enemy before i , as the breach of water .
therefore he call the name of that place baalperazim .
and there they leave they image , and david and he man burn they .
and the philistines come up yet again , and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim .
and when david enquire of the lord , he say , thou shalt not go up ; but fetch a compass behind they , and come upon they over against the mulberry tree .
and let it be , when thou hearest the sound of a go in the top of the mulberry tree , that then thou shalt bestir thyself : for then shall the lord go out before thee , to smite the host of the philistines .
and david do so , as the lord have command he ; and smite the philistines from geba until thou come to gazer .
again , david gather together all the choose man of israel , thirty thousand .
and david arise , and go with all the people that be with he from baale of judah , to bring up from thence the ark of god , whose name be call by the name of the lord of host that dwelleth between the cherubim .
and they set the ark of god upon a new cart , and bring it out of the house of abinadab that be in gibeah : and uzzah and ahio , the son of abinadab , drave the new cart .
and they bring it out of the house of abinadab which be at gibeah , accompany the ark of god : and ahio go before the ark .
and david and all the house of israel play before the lord on all manner of instrument make of fir wood , even on harp , and on psaltery , and on timbrel , and on cornet , and on cymbal .
and when they come to nachon 's threshingfloor , uzzah put forth he hand to the ark of god , and take hold of it ; for the oxen shake it .
and the anger of the lord be kindle against uzzah ; and god smite he there for he error ; and there he die by the ark of god .
and david be displeased , because the lord have make a breach upon uzzah : and he call the name of the place perezuzzah to this day .
and david be afraid of the lord that day , and say , how shall the ark of the lord come to i ?
so david would not remove the ark of the lord unto he into the city of david : but david carry it aside into the house of obededom the gittite .
and the ark of the lord continue in the house of obededom the gittite three month : and the lord bless obededom , and all he household .
and it be tell king david , say , the lord have bless the house of obededom , and all that pertaineth unto he , because of the ark of god .
so david go and bring up the ark of god from the house of obededom into the city of david with gladness .
and it be so , that when they that bare the ark of the lord have go six pace , he sacrifice ox and fatling .
and david dance before the lord with all he might ; and david be gird with a linen ephod .
so david and all the house of israel bring up the ark of the lord with shout , and with the sound of the trumpet .
and as the ark of the lord come into the city of david , michal saul 's daughter look through a window , and see king david leap and dance before the lord ; and she despise he in she heart .
and they bring in the ark of the lord , and set it in he place , in the midst of the tabernacle that david have pitch for it : and david offer burnt offering and peace offering before the lord .
and as soon as david have make a end of offer burnt offering and peace offering , he bless the people in the name of the lord of host .
and he deal among all the people , even among the whole multitude of israel , as well to the woman as man , to every one a cake of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine .
so all the people depart every one to he house .
then david return to bless he household .
and michal the daughter of saul come out to meet david , and say , how glorious be the king of israel to day , who uncover himself to day in the eye of the handmaid of he servant , as one of the vain fellow shamelessly uncovereth himself !
and david say unto michal , it be before the lord , which choose i before thy father , and before all he house , to appoint i ruler over the people of the lord , over israel : therefore will i play before the lord .
and i will yet be more vile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the maidservant which thou hast speak of , of they shall i be have in honour .
therefore michal the daughter of saul have no child unto the day of she death .
and it come to pass , when the king sit in he house , and the lord have give he rest round about from all he enemy ;
that the king say unto nathan the prophet , see now , i dwell in a house of cedar , but the ark of god dwelleth within curtain .
and nathan say to the king , go , do all that be in thine heart ; for the lord be with thee .
and it come to pass that night , that the word of the lord come unto nathan , say ,
go and tell my servant david , thus saith the lord , shalt thou build i a house for i to dwell in ?
whereas i have not dwell in any house since the time that i bring up the child of israel out of egypt , even to this day , but have walk in a tent and in a tabernacle .
in all the place wherein i have walk with all the child of israel speak i a word with any of the tribe of israel , whom i command to feed my people israel , say , why build ye not i a house of cedar ?
now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant david , thus saith the lord of host , i take thee from the sheepcote , from follow the sheep , to be ruler over my people , over israel :
and i be with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemy out of thy sight , and have make thee a great name , like unto the name of the great man that be in the earth .
moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel , and will plant they , that they may dwell in a place of they own , and move no more ; neither shall the child of wickedness afflict they any more , as beforetime ,
and as since the time that i command judge to be over my people israel , and have cause thee to rest from all thine enemy .
also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee a house .
and when thy day be fulfil , and thou shalt sleep with thy father , i will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy bowels , and i will establish he kingdom .
he shall build a house for my name , and i will stablish the throne of he kingdom for ever .
i will be he father , and he shall be my son .
if he commit iniquity , i will chasten he with the rod of man , and with the stripe of the child of man :
but my mercy shall not depart away from he , as i take it from saul , whom i put away before thee .
and thine house and thy kingdom shall be establish for ever before thee : thy throne shall be establish for ever .
accord to all these word , and accord to all this vision , so do nathan speak unto david .
then go king david in , and sit before the lord , and he say , who be i , o lord god ? and what be my house , that thou hast bring i hitherto ?
and this be yet a small thing in thy sight , o lord god ; but thou hast speak also of thy servant 's house for a great while to come .
and be this the manner of man , o lord god ?
and what can david say more unto thee ? for thou , lord god , knowest thy servant .
for thy word 's sake , and accord to thine own heart , hast thou do all these great thing , to make thy servant know they .
wherefore thou art great , o lord god : for there be none like thee , neither be there any god beside thee , accord to all that we have hear with we ear .
and what one nation in the earth be like thy people , even like israel , whom god go to redeem for a people to himself , and to make he a name , and to do for you great thing and terrible , for thy land , before thy people , which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt , from the nation and they god ?
for thou hast confirm to thyself thy people israel to be a people unto thee for ever : and thou , lord , art become they god .
and now , o lord god , the word that thou hast speak concern thy servant , and concern he house , establish it for ever , and do as thou hast say .
and let thy name be magnify for ever , say , the lord of host be the god over israel : and let the house of thy servant david be establish before thee .
for thou , o lord of host , god of israel , hast reveal to thy servant , say , i will build thee a house : therefore have thy servant find in he heart to pray this prayer unto thee .
and now , o lord god , thou art that god , and thy word be true , and thou hast promise this goodness unto thy servant :
therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may continue for ever before thee : for thou , o lord god , hast speak it : and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be bless for ever .
and after this it come to pass that david smite the philistines , and subdue they : and david take methegammah out of the hand of the philistines .
and he smite moab , and measure they with a line , cast they down to the ground ; even with two line measure he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive .
and so the moabites become david 's servant , and bring gift .
david smote also hadadezer , the son of rehob , king of zobah , as he go to recover he border at the river euphrates .
and david take from he a thousand chariot , and seven hundred horseman , and twenty thousand footman : and david hough all the chariot horse , but reserve of they for a hundred chariot .
and when the syrians of damascus come to succour hadadezer king of zobah , david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand man .
then david put garrison in syria of damascus : and the syrians become servant to david , and bring gift .
and the lord preserved david whithersoever he go .
and david take the shield of gold that be on the servant of hadadezer , and bring they to jerusalem .
and from betah , and from berothai , city of hadadezer , king david take exceed much brass .
when toi king of hamath hear that david have smite all the host of hadadezer ,
then toi send joram he son unto king david , to salute he , and to bless he , because he have fight against hadadezer , and smitten he : for hadadezer have war with toi .
and joram bring with he vessel of silver , and vessel of gold , and vessel of brass :
which also king david do dedicate unto the lord , with the silver and gold that he have dedicate of all nation which he subdue ;
of syria , and of moab , and of the child of ammon , and of the philistines , and of amalek , and of the spoil of hadadezer , son of rehob , king of zobah .
and david gat he a name when he return from smite of the syrians in the valley of salt , be eighteen thousand man .
and he put garrison in edom ; throughout all edom put he garrison , and all they of edom become david 's servant .
and the lord preserved david whithersoever he go .
and david reign over all israel ; and david execute judgment and justice unto all he people .
and joab the son of zeruiah be over the host ; and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud be recorder ;
and zadok the son of ahitub , and ahimelech the son of abiathar , be the priest ; and seraiah be the scribe ;
and benaiah the son of jehoiada be over both the cherethites and the pelethites ; and david 's son be chief ruler .
and david say , be there yet any that be leave of the house of saul , that i may shew he kindness for jonathan 's sake ?
and there be of the house of saul a servant whose name be ziba .
and when they have call he unto david , the king say unto he , art thou ziba ?
and he say , thy servant be he .
and the king say , be there not yet any of the house of saul , that i may shew the kindness of god unto he ?
and ziba say unto the king , jonathan have yet a son , which be lame on he foot .
and the king say unto he , where be he ?
and ziba say unto the king , behold , he be in the house of machir , the son of ammiel , in lodebar .
then king david send , and fetch he out of the house of machir , the son of ammiel , from lodebar .
now when mephibosheth , the son of jonathan , the son of saul , be come unto david , he fall on he face , and do reverence .
and david say , mephibosheth .
and he answer , behold thy servant !
and david say unto he , fear not : for i will surely shew thee kindness for jonathan thy father 's sake , and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father ; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually .
and he bow himself , and say , what be thy servant , that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i be ?
then the king call to ziba , saul 's servant , and say unto he , i have give unto thy master 's son all that pertain to saul and to all he house .
thou therefore , and thy son , and thy servant , shall till the land for he , and thou shalt bring in the fruit , that thy master 's son may have food to eat : but mephibosheth thy master 's son shall eat bread alway at my table .
now ziba have fifteen son and twenty servant .
then say ziba unto the king , accord to all that my lord the king have command he servant , so shall thy servant do .
as for mephibosheth , say the king , he shall eat at my table , as one of the king 's son .
and mephibosheth have a young son , whose name be micha .
and all that dwelt in the house of ziba be servant unto mephibosheth .
so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem : for he do eat continually at the king 's table ; and be lame on both he foot .
and it come to pass after this , that the king of the child of ammon die , and hanun he son reign in he stead .
then say david , i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash , as he father shew kindness unto i .
and david send to comfort he by the hand of he servant for he father .
and david 's servant come into the land of the child of ammon .
and the prince of the child of ammon say unto hanun they lord , thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father , that he have send comforter unto thee ? have not david rather send he servant unto thee , to search the city , and to spy it out , and to overthrow it ?
wherefore hanun take david 's servant , and shave off the one half of they beard , and cut off they garment in the middle , even to they buttock , and send they away .
when they tell it unto david , he send to meet they , because the man be greatly ashamed : and the king say , tarry at jericho until you beard be grow , and then return .
and when the child of ammon see that they stink before david , the child of ammon send and hire the syrians of bethrehob , and the syrians of zoba , twenty thousand footman , and of king maacah a thousand man , and of ishtob twelve thousand man .
and when david hear of it , he send joab , and all the host of the mighty man .
and the child of ammon come out , and put the battle in array at the enter in of the gate : and the syrians of zoba , and of rehob , and ishtob , and maacah , be by themselves in the field .
when joab see that the front of the battle be against he before and behind , he choose of all the choice man of israel , and put they in array against the syrians :
and the rest of the people he deliver into the hand of abishai he brother , that he might put they in array against the child of ammon .
and he say , if the syrians be too strong for i , then thou shalt help i : but if the child of ammon be too strong for thee , then i will come and help thee .
be of good courage , and let we play the man for we people , and for the city of we god : and the lord do that which seemeth he good .
and joab draw nigh , and the people that be with he , unto the battle against the syrians : and they flee before he .
and when the child of ammon see that the syrians be flee , then flee they also before abishai , and enter into the city .
so joab return from the child of ammon , and come to jerusalem .
and when the syrians see that they be smite before israel , they gather themselves together .
and hadarezer send , and bring out the syrians that be beyond the river : and they come to helam ; and shobach the captain of the host of hadarezer go before they .
and when it be tell david , he gather all israel together , and pass over jordan , and come to helam .
and the syrians set themselves in array against david , and fight with he .
and the syrians flee before israel ; and david slew the man of seven hundred chariot of the syrians , and forty thousand horseman , and smite shobach the captain of they host , who die there .
and when all the king that be servant to hadarezer see that they be smite before israel , they make peace with israel , and serve they .
so the syrians fear to help the child of ammon any more .
and it come to pass , after the year be expire , at the time when king go forth to battle , that david send joab , and he servant with he , and all israel ; and they destroy the child of ammon , and besiege rabbah .
but david tarry still at jerusalem .
and it come to pass in a eveningtide , that david arise from off he bed , and walk upon the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he see a woman wash herself ; and the woman be very beautiful to look upon .
and david send and enquire after the woman .
and one say , be not this bathsheba , the daughter of eliam , the wife of uriah the hittite ?
and david send messenger , and take she ; and she come in unto he , and he lay with she ; for she be purify from she uncleanness : and she return unto she house .
and the woman conceive , and send and tell david , and say , i be with child .
and david send to joab , say , send i uriah the hittite .
and joab send uriah to david .
and when uriah be come unto he , david demand of he how joab do , and how the people do , and how the war prosper .
and david say to uriah , go down to thy house , and wash thy foot .
and uriah depart out of the king 's house , and there follow he a mess of meat from the king .
but uriah sleep at the door of the king 's house with all the servant of he lord , and go not down to he house .
and when they have tell david , say , uriah go not down unto he house , david say unto uriah , camest thou not from thy journey ? why then do thou not go down unto thine house ?
and uriah say unto david , the ark , and israel , and judah , abide in tent ; and my lord joab , and the servant of my lord , be encamp in the open field ; shall i then go into mine house , to eat and to drink , and to lie with my wife ? as thou livest , and as thy soul liveth , i will not do this thing .
and david say to uriah , tarry here to day also , and to morrow i will let thee depart .
so uriah abode in jerusalem that day , and the morrow .
and when david have call he , he do eat and drink before he ; and he make he drunk : and at even he go out to lie on he bed with the servant of he lord , but go not down to he house .
and it come to pass in the morning , that david write a letter to joab , and send it by the hand of uriah .
and he write in the letter , say , set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle , and retire ye from he , that he may be smitten , and die .
and it come to pass , when joab observe the city , that he assign uriah unto a place where he know that valiant man be .
and the man of the city go out , and fight with joab : and there fall some of the people of the servant of david ; and uriah the hittite die also .
then joab send and tell david all the thing concern the war ;
and charge the messenger , say , when thou hast make a end of tell the matter of the war unto the king ,
and if so be that the king 's wrath arise , and he say unto thee , wherefore approach ye so nigh unto the city when ye do fight ? know ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
who smite abimelech the son of jerubbesheth ? do not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon he from the wall , that he die in thebez ? why go ye nigh the wall ? then say thou , thy servant uriah the hittite be dead also .
so the messenger go , and come and shew david all that joab have send he for .
and the messenger say unto david , surely the man prevail against we , and come out unto we into the field , and we be upon they even unto the enter of the gate .
and the shooter shoot from off the wall upon thy servant ; and some of the king 's servant be dead , and thy servant uriah the hittite be dead also .
then david say unto the messenger , thus shalt thou say unto joab , let not this thing displease thee , for the sword devoureth one as well as another : make thy battle more strong against the city , and overthrow it : and encourage thou he .
and when the wife of uriah hear that uriah she husband be dead , she mourn for she husband .
and when the mourning be past , david send and fetch she to he house , and she become he wife , and bare he a son .
but the thing that david have do displeased the lord .
and the lord send nathan unto david .
and he come unto he , and say unto he , there be two man in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
the rich man have exceed many flock and herd :
but the poor man have nothing , save one little ewe lamb , which he have buy and nourish up : and it grow up together with he , and with he child ; it do eat of he own meat , and drink of he own cup , and lay in he bosom , and be unto he as a daughter .
and there come a traveller unto the rich man , and he spare to take of he own flock and of he own herd , to dress for the wayfaring man that be come unto he ; but take the poor man 's lamb , and dress it for the man that be come to he .
and david 's anger be greatly kindle against the man ; and he say to nathan , as the lord liveth , the man that have do this thing shall surely die :
and he shall restore the lamb fourfold , because he do this thing , and because he have no pity .
and nathan say to david , thou art the man .
thus saith the lord god of israel , i anoint thee king over israel , and i deliver thee out of the hand of saul ;
and i give thee thy master 's house , and thy master 's wife into thy bosom , and give thee the house of israel and of judah ; and if that have be too little , i would moreover have give unto thee such and such thing .
wherefore hast thou despise the commandment of the lord , to do evil in he sight ? thou hast kill uriah the hittite with the sword , and hast take he wife to be thy wife , and hast slay he with the sword of the child of ammon .
now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house ; because thou hast despise i , and hast take the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife .
thus saith the lord , behold , i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house , and i will take thy wife before thine eye , and give they unto thy neighbour , and he shall lie with thy wife in the sight of this sun .
for thou didst it secretly : but i will do this thing before all israel , and before the sun .
and david say unto nathan , i have sin against the lord .
and nathan say unto david , the lord also have put away thy sin ; thou shalt not die .
howbeit , because by this deed thou hast give great occasion to the enemy of the lord to blaspheme , the child also that be bear unto thee shall surely die .
and nathan depart unto he house .
and the lord strike the child that uriah 's wife bare unto david , and it be very sick .
david therefore besought god for the child ; and david fast , and go in , and lay all night upon the earth .
and the elder of he house arise , and go to he , to raise he up from the earth : but he would not , neither do he eat bread with they .
and it come to pass on the seventh day , that the child die .
and the servant of david fear to tell he that the child be dead : for they say , behold , while the child be yet alive , we speak unto he , and he would not hearken unto we voice : how will he then vex himself , if we tell he that the child be dead ?
but when david see that he servant whisper , david perceive that the child be dead : therefore david say unto he servant , be the child dead ?
and they say , he be dead .
then david arise from the earth , and wash , and anoint himself , and change he apparel , and come into the house of the lord , and worship : then he come to he own house ; and when he require , they set bread before he , and he do eat .
then say he servant unto he , what thing be this that thou hast do ? thou didst fast and weep for the child , while it be alive ; but when the child be dead , thou didst rise and eat bread .
and he say , while the child be yet alive , i fast and weep : for i say , who can tell whether god will be gracious to i , that the child may live ?
but now he be dead , wherefore should i fast ? can i bring he back again ?
i shall go to he , but he shall not return to i .
and david comfort bathsheba he wife , and go in unto she , and lay with she : and she bare a son , and he call he name solomon : and the lord love he .
and he send by the hand of nathan the prophet ; and he call he name jedidiah , because of the lord .
and joab fight against rabbah of the child of ammon , and take the royal city .
and joab send messenger to david , and say , i have fight against rabbah , and have take the city of water .
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and encamp against the city , and take it : lest i take the city , and it be call after my name .
and david gather all the people together , and go to rabbah , and fight against it , and take it .
and he take they king 's crown from off he head , the weight whereof be a talent of gold with the precious stone : and it be set on david 's head .
and he bring forth the spoil of the city in great abundance .
and he bring forth the people that be therein , and put they under saw , and under harrow of iron , and under axis of iron , and make they pass through the brick-kiln : and thus do he unto all the city of the child of ammon .
so david and all the people return unto jerusalem .
and it come to pass after this , that absalom the son of david have a fair sister , whose name be tamar ; and amnon the son of david love she .
and amnon be so vexed , that he fall sick for he sister tamar ; for she be a virgin ; and amnon think it hard for he to do anything to she .
but amnon have a friend , whose name be jonadab , the son of shimeah david 's brother : and jonadab be a very subtil man .
and he say unto he , why art thou , be the king 's son , lean from day to day ? wilt thou not tell i ?
and amnon say unto he , i love tamar , my brother absalom 's sister .
and jonadab say unto he , lay thee down on thy bed , and make thyself sick : and when thy father cometh to see thee , say unto he , i pray thee , let my sister tamar come , and give i meat , and dress the meat in my sight , that i may see it , and eat it at she hand .
so amnon lay down , and make himself sick : and when the king be come to see he , amnon say unto the king , i pray thee , let tamar my sister come , and make i a couple of cake in my sight , that i may eat at she hand .
then david send home to tamar , say , go now to thy brother amnon 's house , and dress he meat .
so tamar go to she brother amnon 's house ; and he be lay down .
and she take flour , and knead it , and make cake in he sight , and do bake the cake .
and she take a pan , and pour they out before he ; but he refuse to eat .
and amnon say , have out all man from i .
and they go out every man from he .
and amnon say unto tamar , bring the meat into the chamber , that i may eat of thine hand .
and tamar take the cake which she have make , and bring they into the chamber to amnon she brother .
and when she have bring they unto he to eat , he take hold of she , and say unto she , come lie with i , my sister .
and she answer he , nay , my brother , do not force i ; for no such thing ought to be do in israel : do not thou this folly .
and i , whither shall i cause my shame to go ? and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fool in israel .
now therefore , i pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he will not withhold i from thee .
howbeit he would not hearken unto she voice : but , be stronger than she , force she , and lay with she .
then amnon hate she exceedingly ; so that the hatred wherewith he hate she be greater than the love wherewith he have love she .
and amnon say unto she , arise , be go .
and she say unto he , there be no cause : this evil in send i away be greater than the other that thou didst unto i .
but he would not hearken unto she .
then he call he servant that minister unto he , and say , put now this woman out from i , and bolt the door after she .
and she have a garment of diver colour upon she : for with such robe be the king 's daughter that be virgin apparel .
then he servant bring she out , and bolt the door after she .
and tamar put ash on she head , and rent she garment of diver colour that be on she , and lay she hand on she head , and go on cry .
and absalom she brother say unto she , hath amnon thy brother be with thee ? but hold now thy peace , my sister : he be thy brother ; regard not this thing .
so tamar remain desolate in she brother absalom 's house .
but when king david hear of all these thing , he be very wroth .
and absalom speak unto he brother amnon neither good nor bad : for absalom hate amnon , because he have force he sister tamar .
and it come to pass after two full year , that absalom have sheepshearer in baalhazor , which be beside ephraim : and absalom invite all the king 's son .
and absalom come to the king , and say , behold now , thy servant have sheepshearer ; let the king , i beseech thee , and he servant go with thy servant .
and the king say to absalom , nay , my son , let we not all now go , lest we be chargeable unto thee .
and he press he : howbeit he would not go , but bless he .
then say absalom , if not , i pray thee , let my brother amnon go with we .
and the king say unto he , why should he go with thee ?
but absalom press he , that he let amnon and all the king 's son go with he .
now absalom have command he servant , say , mark ye now when amnon 's heart be merry with wine , and when i say unto you , smite amnon ; then kill he , fear not : have not i command you ? be courageous , and be valiant .
and the servant of absalom do unto amnon as absalom have command .
then all the king 's son arise , and every man gat he up upon he mule , and flee .
and it come to pass , while they be in the way , that tiding come to david , say , absalom have slay all the king 's son , and there be not one of they leave .
then the king arise , and tare he garment , and lay on the earth ; and all he servant stand by with they clothes rent .
and jonadab , the son of shimeah david 's brother , answer and say , let not my lord suppose that they have slay all the young man the king 's son ; for amnon only be dead : for by the appointment of absalom this have be determine from the day that he force he sister tamar .
now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to he heart , to think that all the king 's son be dead : for amnon only be dead .
but absalom flee .
and the young man that keep the watch lift up he eye , and look , and , behold , there come much people by the way of the hill side behind he .
and jonadab say unto the king , behold , the king 's son come : as thy servant say , so it be .
and it come to pass , as soon as he have make a end of speaking , that , behold , the king 's son come , and lift up they voice and weep : and the king also and all he servant weep very sore .
but absalom flee , and go to talmai , the son of ammihud , king of geshur .
and david mourn for he son every day .
so absalom flee , and go to geshur , and be there three year .
and the soul of king david long to go forth unto absalom : for he be comfort concern amnon , see he be dead .
now joab the son of zeruiah perceive that the king 's heart be toward absalom .
and joab send to tekoah , and fetch thence a wise woman , and say unto she , i pray thee , feign thyself to be a mourner , and put on now mourn apparel , and anoint not thyself with oil , but be as a woman that have a long time mourn for the dead :
and come to the king , and speak on this manner unto he .
so joab put the word in she mouth .
and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king , she fall on she face to the ground , and do obeisance , and say , help , o king .
and the king say unto she , what aileth thee ?
and she answer , i be indeed a widow woman , and mine husband be dead .
and thy handmaid have two son , and they two strive together in the field , and there be none to part they , but the one smite the other , and slew he .
and , behold , the whole family be rise against thine handmaid , and they say , deliver he that smite he brother , that we may kill he , for the life of he brother whom he slew ; and we will destroy the heir also : and so they shall quench my coal which be leave , and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth .
and the king say unto the woman , go to thine house , and i will give charge concern thee .
and the woman of tekoah say unto the king , my lord , o king , the iniquity be on i , and on my father 's house : and the king and he throne be guiltless .
and the king say , whosoever saith ought unto thee , bring he to i , and he shall not touch thee any more .
then say she , i pray thee , let the king remember the lord thy god , that thou wouldest not suffer the revenger of blood to destroy any more , lest they destroy my son .
and he say , as the lord liveth , there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth .
then the woman say , let thine handmaid , i pray thee , speak one word unto my lord the king .
and he say , say on .
and the woman say , wherefore then hast thou think such a thing against the people of god ? for the king doth speak this thing as one which be faulty , in that the king doth not fetch home again he banish .
for we must need die , and be as water spill on the ground , which can not be gather up again ; neither doth god respect any person : yet doth he devise means , that he banish be not expel from he .
now therefore that i be come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king , it be because the people have make i afraid : and thy handmaid say , i will now speak unto the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of he handmaid .
for the king will hear , to deliver he handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy i and my son together out of the inheritance of god .
then thine handmaid say , the word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable : for as a angel of god , so be my lord the king to discern good and bad : therefore the lord thy god will be with thee .
then the king answer and say unto the woman , hide not from i , i pray thee , the thing that i shall ask thee .
and the woman say , let my lord the king now speak .
and the king say , be not the hand of joab with thee in all this ?
and the woman answer and say , as thy soul liveth , my lord the king , none can turn to the right hand or to the leave from ought that my lord the king have speak : for thy servant joab , he bid i , and he put all these word in the mouth of thine handmaid :
to fetch about this form of speech have thy servant joab do this thing : and my lord be wise , accord to the wisdom of a angel of god , to know all thing that be in the earth .
and the king say unto joab , behold now , i have do this thing : go therefore , bring the young man absalom again .
and joab fall to the ground on he face , and bow himself , and thank the king : and joab say , to day thy servant knoweth that i have find grace in thy sight , my lord , o king , in that the king have fulfil the request of he servant .
so joab arise and go to geshur , and bring absalom to jerusalem .
and the king say , let he turn to he own house , and let he not see my face .
so absalom return to he own house , and see not the king 's face .
but in all israel there be none to be so much praise as absalom for he beauty : from the sole of he foot even to the crown of he head there be no blemish in he .
and when he poll he head , ( for it be at every year 's end that he poll it : because the hair be heavy on he , therefore he poll it : ) he weigh the hair of he head at two hundred shekel after the king 's weight .
and unto absalom there be bear three son , and one daughter , whose name be tamar : she be a woman of a fair countenance .
so absalom dwelt two full year in jerusalem , and see not the king 's face .
therefore absalom send for joab , to have send he to the king ; but he would not come to he : and when he send again the second time , he would not come .
therefore he say unto he servant , see , joab 's field be near mine , and he have barley there ; go and set it on fire .
and absalom 's servant set the field on fire .
then joab arise , and come to absalom unto he house , and say unto he , wherefore have thy servant set my field on fire ?
and absalom answer joab , behold , i send unto thee , say , come hither , that i may send thee to the king , to say , wherefore be i come from geshur ? it have be good for i to have be there still : now therefore let i see the king 's face ; and if there be any iniquity in i , let he kill i .
so joab come to the king , and tell he : and when he have call for absalom , he come to the king , and bow himself on he face to the ground before the king : and the king kiss absalom .
and it come to pass after this , that absalom prepare he chariot and horse , and fifty man to run before he .
and absalom rise up early , and stand beside the way of the gate : and it be so , that when any man that have a controversy come to the king for judgment , then absalom call unto he , and say , of what city art thou ?
and he say , thy servant be of one of the tribe of israel .
and absalom say unto he , see , thy matter be good and right ; but there be no man depute of the king to hear thee .
absalom say moreover , oh that i be make judge in the land , that every man which have any suit or cause might come unto i , and i would do he justice !
and it be so , that when any man come nigh to he to do he obeisance , he put forth he hand , and take he , and kiss he .
and on this manner do absalom to all israel that come to the king for judgment : so absalom steal the heart of the man of israel .
and it come to pass after forty year , that absalom say unto the king , i pray thee , let i go and pay my vow , which i have vow unto the lord , in hebron .
for thy servant vow a vow while i abide at geshur in syria , say , if the lord shall bring i again indeed to jerusalem , then i will serve the lord .
and the king say unto he , go in peace .
so he arise , and go to hebron .
but absalom send spy throughout all the tribe of israel , say , as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet , then ye shall say , absalom reigneth in hebron .
and with absalom go two hundred man out of jerusalem , that be call ; and they go in they simplicity , and they know not any thing .
and absalom send for ahithophel the gilonite , david 's counsellor , from he city , even from giloh , while he offer sacrifice .
and the conspiracy be strong ; for the people increase continually with absalom .
and there come a messenger to david , say , the heart of the man of israel be after absalom .
and david say unto all he servant that be with he at jerusalem , arise , and let we flee ; for we shall not else escape from absalom : make speed to depart , lest he overtake we suddenly , and bring evil upon we , and smite the city with the edge of the sword .
and the king 's servant say unto the king , behold , thy servant be ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint .
and the king go forth , and all he household after he .
and the king leave ten woman , which be concubine , to keep the house .
and the king go forth , and all the people after he , and tarry in a place that be far off .
and all he servant pass on beside he ; and all the cherethites , and all the pelethites , and all the gittites , six hundred man which come after he from gath , pass on before the king .
then say the king to ittai the gittite , wherefore goest thou also with we ? return to thy place , and abide with the king : for thou art a stranger , and also a exile .
whereas thou camest but yesterday , should i this day make thee go up and down with we ? see i go whither i may , return thou , and take back thy brethren : mercy and truth be with thee .
and ittaus answer the king , and say , as the lord liveth , and as my lord the king liveth , surely in what place my lord the king shall be , whether in death or life , even there also will thy servant be .
and david say to ittai , go and pass over .
and ittai the gittite pass over , and all he man , and all the little one that be with he .
and all the country weep with a loud voice , and all the people pass over : the king also himself pass over the brook kidron , and all the people pass over , toward the way of the wilderness .
and lo zadok also , and all the levites be with he , bear the ark of the covenant of god : and they set down the ark of god ; and abiathar go up , until all the people have do pass out of the city .
and the king say unto zadok , carry back the ark of god into the city : if i shall find favour in the eye of the lord , he will bring i again , and shew i both it , and he habitation :
but if he thus say , i have no delight in thee ; behold , here be i , let he do to i as seemeth good unto he .
the king say also unto zadok the priest , art not thou a seer ? return into the city in peace , and you two son with you , ahimaaz thy son , and jonathan the son of abiathar .
see , i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness , until there come word from you to certify i .
zadok therefore and abiathar carry the ark of god again to jerusalem : and they tarry there .
and david go up by the ascent of mount olivet , and weep as he go up , and have he head cover , and he go barefoot : and all the people that be with he cover every man he head , and they go up , weep as they go up .
and one tell david , say , ahithophel be among the conspirator with absalom .
and david say , o lord , i pray thee , turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness .
and it come to pass , that when david be come to the top of the mount , where he worship god , behold , hushai the archite come to meet he with he coat rent , and earth upon he head :
unto whom david say , if thou passest on with i , then thou shalt be a burden unto i :
but if thou return to the city , and say unto absalom , i will be thy servant , o king ; as i have be thy father 's servant hitherto , so will i now also be thy servant : then mayest thou for i defeat the counsel of ahithophel .
and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priest ? therefore it shall be , that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king 's house , thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priest .
behold , they have there with they they two son , ahimaaz zadok 's son , and jonathan abiathar 's son ; and by they ye shall send unto i every thing that ye can hear .
so hushai david 's friend come into the city , and absalom come into jerusalem .
and when david be a little past the top of the hill , behold , ziba the servant of mephibosheth meet he , with a couple of ass saddle , and upon they two hundred loaf of bread , and a hundred bunch of raisin , and a hundred of summer fruit , and a bottle of wine .
and the king say unto ziba , what meanest thou by these ?
and ziba say , the ass be for the king 's household to ride on ; and the bread and summer fruit for the young man to eat ; and the wine , that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink .
and the king say , and where be thy master 's son ?
and ziba say unto the king , behold , he abideth at jerusalem : for he say , to day shall the house of israel restore i the kingdom of my father .
then say the king to ziba , behold , thine be all that pertain unto mephibosheth .
and ziba say , i humbly beseech thee that i may find grace in thy sight , my lord , o king .
and when king david come to bahurim , behold , thence come out a man of the family of the house of saul , whose name be shimei , the son of gera : he come forth , and curse still as he come .
and he cast stone at david , and at all the servant of king david : and all the people and all the mighty man be on he right hand and on he left .
and thus say shimei when he curse , come out , come out , thou bloody man , and thou man of belial :
the lord have return upon thee all the blood of the house of saul , in whose stead thou hast reign ; and the lord have deliver the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son : and , behold , thou art take in thy mischief , because thou art a bloody man .
then say abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king , why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? let i go over , i pray thee , and take off he head .
and the king say , what have i to do with you , ye son of zeruiah ? so let he curse , because the lord have say unto he , curse david .
who shall then say , wherefore hast thou do so ?
and david say to abishai , and to all he servant , behold , my son , which come forth of my bowels , seeketh my life : how much more now may this benjamite do it ? let he alone , and let he curse ; for the lord have bid he .
it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction , and that the lord will requite i good for he cursing this day .
and as david and he man go by the way , shimei go along on the hill 's side over against he , and curse as he go , and throw stone at he , and cast dust .
and the king , and all the people that be with he , come weary , and refresh themselves there .
and absalom , and all the people the man of israel , come to jerusalem , and ahithophel with he .
and it come to pass , when hushai the archite , david 's friend , be come unto absalom , that hushai say unto absalom , god save the king , god save the king .
and absalom say to hushai , be this thy kindness to thy friend ? why wentest thou not with thy friend ?
and hushai say unto absalom , nay ; but whom the lord , and this people , and all the man of israel , choose , he will i be , and with he will i abide .
and again , whom should i serve ? should i not serve in the presence of he son ? as i have serve in thy father 's presence , so will i be in thy presence .
then say absalom to ahithophel , give counsel among you what we shall do .
and ahithophel say unto absalom , go in unto thy father 's concubine , which he have leave to keep the house ; and all israel shall hear that thou art abhor of thy father : then shall the hand of all that be with thee be strong .
so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house ; and absalom go in unto he father 's concubine in the sight of all israel .
and the counsel of ahithophel , which he counsel in those day , be as if a man have enquire at the oracle of god : so be all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom .
moreover ahithophel say unto absalom , let i now choose out twelve thousand man , and i will arise and pursue after david this night :
and i will come upon he while he be weary and weak handed , and will make he afraid : and all the people that be with he shall flee ; and i will smite the king only :
and i will bring back all the people unto thee : the man whom thou seekest be as if all return : so all the people shall be in peace .
and the say pleased absalom well , and all the elder of israel .
then say absalom , call now hushai the archite also , and let we hear likewise what he saith .
and when hushai be come to absalom , absalom spake unto he , say , ahithophel have speak after this manner : shall we do after he say ? if not ; speak thou .
and hushai say unto absalom , the counsel that ahithophel have give be not good at this time .
for , say hushai , thou knowest thy father and he man , that they be mighty man , and they be chafe in they mind , as a bear rob of she whelp in the field : and thy father be a man of war , and will not lodge with the people .
behold , he be hide now in some pit , or in some other place : and it will come to pass , when some of they be overthrow at the first , that whosoever heareth it will say , there be a slaughter among the people that follow absalom .
and he also that be valiant , whose heart be as the heart of a lion , shall utterly melt : for all israel knoweth that thy father be a mighty man , and they which be with he be valiant man .
therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gather unto thee , from dan even to beersheba , as the sand that be by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in thine own person .
so shall we come upon he in some place where he shall be find , and we will light upon he as the dew falleth on the ground : and of he and of all the man that be with he there shall not be leave so much as one .
moreover , if he be get into a city , then shall all israel bring rope to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there be not one small stone find there .
and absalom and all the man of israel say , the counsel of hushai the archite be better than the counsel of ahithophel .
for the lord have appoint to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel , to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom .
then say hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priest , thus and thus do ahithophel counsel absalom and the elder of israel ; and thus and thus have i counsel .
now therefore send quickly , and tell david , say , lodge not this night in the plain of the wilderness , but speedily pass over ; lest the king be swallow up , and all the people that be with he .
now jonathan and ahimaaz stay by enrogel ; for they might not be see to come into the city : and a wench go and tell they ; and they go and tell king david .
nevertheless a lad see they , and tell absalom : but they go both of they away quickly , and come to a man 's house in bahurim , which have a well in he court ; whither they go down .
and the woman take and spread a cover over the well 's mouth , and spread ground corn thereon ; and the thing be not know .
and when absalom 's servant come to the woman to the house , they say , where be ahimaaz and jonathan ?
and the woman say unto they , they be go over the brook of water .
and when they have seek and could not find they , they return to jerusalem .
and it come to pass , after they be depart , that they come up out of the well , and go and tell king david , and say unto david , arise , and pass quickly over the water : for thus have ahithophel counsel against you .
then david arise , and all the people that be with he , and they pass over jordan : by the morning light there lack not one of they that be not go over jordan .
and when ahithophel see that he counsel be not follow , he saddle he ass , and arise , and gat he home to he house , to he city , and put he household in order , and hang himself , and die , and be bury in the sepulchre of he father .
then david come to mahanaim .
and absalom pass over jordan , he and all the man of israel with he .
and absalom make amasa captain of the host instead of joab : which amasa be a man 's son , whose name be ithra a israelite , that go in to abigail the daughter of nahash , sister to zeruiah joab 's mother .
so israel and absalom pitch in the land of gilead .
and it come to pass , when david be come to mahanaim , that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the child of ammon , and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar , and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim ,
brought bed , and bason , and earthen vessel , and wheat , and barley , and flour , and parched corn , and bean , and lentile , and parched pulse ,
and honey , and butter , and sheep , and cheese of kine , for david , and for the people that be with he , to eat : for they say , the people be hungry , and weary , and thirsty , in the wilderness .
and david number the people that be with he , and set captain of thousand and captain of hundred over they .
and david send forth a third part of the people under the hand of joab , and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah , joab 's brother , and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite .
and the king say unto the people , i will surely go forth with you myself also .
but the people answer , thou shalt not go forth : for if we flee away , they will not care for we ; neither if half of we die , will they care for we : but now thou art worth ten thousand of we : therefore now it be better that thou succour we out of the city .
and the king say unto they , what seemeth you best i will do .
and the king stand by the gate side , and all the people come out by hundred and by thousand .
and the king command joab and abishai and ittai , say , deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with absalom .
and all the people hear when the king give all the captain charge concern absalom .
so the people go out into the field against israel : and the battle be in the wood of ephraim ;
where the people of israel be slay before the servant of david , and there be there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand man .
for the battle be there scatter over the face of all the country : and the wood devour more people that day than the sword devour .
and absalom meet the servant of david .
and absalom ride upon a mule , and the mule go under the thick bough of a great oak , and he head catch hold of the oak , and he be take up between the heaven and the earth ; and the mule that be under he go away .
and a certain man see it , and tell joab , and say , behold , i see absalom hang in a oak .
and joab say unto the man that tell he , and , behold , thou sawest he , and why didst thou not smite he there to the ground ? and i would have give thee ten shekel of silver , and a girdle .
and the man say unto joab , though i should receive a thousand shekel of silver in mine hand , yet would i not put forth mine hand against the king 's son : for in we hear the king charge thee and abishai and ittai , say , beware that none touch the young man absalom .
otherwise i should have work falsehood against mine own life : for there be no matter hide from the king , and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against i .
then say joab , i may not tarry thus with thee .
and he take three dart in he hand , and thrust they through the heart of absalom , while he be yet alive in the midst of the oak .
and ten young man that bare joab 's armour compass about and smite absalom , and slew he .
and joab blow the trumpet , and the people return from pursue after israel : for joab hold back the people .
and they take absalom , and cast he into a great pit in the wood , and lay a very great heap of stone upon he : and all israel flee every one to he tent .
now absalom in he lifetime have take and rear up for himself a pillar , which be in the king 's dale : for he say , i have no son to keep my name in remembrance : and he call the pillar after he own name : and it be call unto this day , absalom 's place .
then say ahimaaz the son of zadok , let i now run , and bear the king tiding , how that the lord have avenge he of he enemy .
and joab say unto he , thou shalt not bear tiding this day , but thou shalt bear tiding another day : but this day thou shalt bear no tiding , because the king 's son be dead .
then say joab to cushi , go tell the king what thou hast see .
and cushi bow himself unto joab , and run .
then say ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab , but howsoever , let i , i pray thee , also run after cushi .
and joab say , wherefore wilt thou run , my son , see that thou hast no tiding ready ?
but howsoever , say he , let i run .
and he say unto he , run .
then ahimaaz run by the way of the plain , and overran cushus .
and david sit between the two gate : and the watchman go up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lift up he eye , and look , and behold a man running alone .
and the watchman cry , and tell the king .
and the king say , if he be alone , there be tiding in he mouth .
and he come apace , and draw near .
and the watchman see another man running : and the watchman call unto the porter , and say , behold another man running alone .
and the king say , he also bringeth tiding .
and the watchman say , i thinketh the running of the foremost be like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok .
and the king say , he be a good man , and cometh with good tiding .
and ahimaaz call , and say unto the king , all be well .
and he fall down to the earth upon he face before the king , and say , blessed be the lord thy god , which have deliver up the man that lift up they hand against my lord the king .
and the king say , be the young man absalom safe ?
and ahimaaz answer , when joab send the king 's servant , and i thy servant , i see a great tumult , but i know not what it be .
and the king say unto he , turn aside , and stand here .
and he turn aside , and stand still .
and , behold , cushi come ; and cushi say , tidings , my lord the king : for the lord have avenge thee this day of all they that rise up against thee .
and the king say unto cushi , be the young man absalom safe ?
and cushus answer , the enemy of my lord the king , and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt , be as that young man be .
and the king be much move , and go up to the chamber over the gate , and weep : and as he go , thus he say , o my son absalom , my son , my son absalom ! would god i have die for thee , o absalom , my son , my son !
and it be tell joab , behold , the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom .
and the victory that day be turn into mourning unto all the people : for the people hear say that day how the king be grieve for he son .
and the people gat they by stealth that day into the city , as people be ashamed steal away when they flee in battle .
but the king cover he face , and the king cry with a loud voice , o my son absalom , o absalom , my son , my son !
and joab come into the house to the king , and say , thou hast shame this day the face of all thy servant , which this day have save thy life , and the life of thy son and of thy daughter , and the life of thy wife , and the life of thy concubine ;
in that thou lovest thine enemy , and hatest thy friend .
for thou hast declare this day , that thou regardest neither prince nor servant : for this day i perceive , that if absalom have live , and all we have die this day , then it have pleased thee well .
now therefore arise , go forth , and speak comfortably unto thy servant : for i swear by the lord , if thou go not forth , there will not tarry one with thee this night : and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befall thee from thy youth until now .
then the king arise , and sit in the gate .
and they tell unto all the people , say , behold , the king doth sit in the gate .
and all the people come before the king : for israel have flee every man to he tent .
and all the people be at strife throughout all the tribe of israel , say , the king save we out of the hand of we enemy , and he deliver we out of the hand of the philistines ; and now he be flee out of the land for absalom .
and absalom , whom we anoint over we , be dead in battle .
now therefore why speak ye not a word of bring the king back ?
and king david send to zadok and to abiathar the priest , say , speak unto the elder of judah , say , why be ye the last to bring the king back to he house ? see the speech of all israel be come to the king , even to he house .
ye be my brethren , ye be my bone and my flesh : wherefore then be ye the last to bring back the king ?
and say ye to amasa , art thou not of my bone , and of my flesh ?
god do so to i , and more also , if thou be not captain of the host before i continually in the room of joab .
and he bow the heart of all the man of judah , even as the heart of one man ; so that they send this word unto the king , return thou , and all thy servant .
so the king return , and come to jordan .
and judah come to gilgal , to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over jordan .
and shimei the son of gera , a benjamite , which be of bahurim , hast and come down with the man of judah to meet king david .
and there be a thousand man of benjamin with he , and ziba the servant of the house of saul , and he fifteen son and he twenty servant with he ; and they go over jordan before the king .
and there go over a ferry boat to carry over the king 's household , and to do what he think good .
and shimei the son of gera fall down before the king , as he be come over jordan ;
and say unto the king , let not my lord impute iniquity unto i , neither do thou remember that which thy servant do perversely the day that my lord the king go out of jerusalem , that the king should take it to he heart .
for thy servant doth know that i have sin : therefore , behold , i be come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
but abishai the son of zeruiah answer and say , shall not shimei be put to death for this , because he curse the lord 's anoint ?
and david say , what have i to do with you , ye son of zeruiah , that ye should this day be adversary unto i ? shall there any man be put to death this day in israel ? for do not i know that i be this day king over israel ?
therefore the king say unto shimei , thou shalt not die .
and the king sware unto he .
and mephibosheth the son of saul come down to meet the king , and have neither dress he foot , nor trim he beard , nor washed he clothes , from the day the king depart until the day he come again in peace .
and it come to pass , when he be come to jerusalem to meet the king , that the king say unto he , wherefore wentest not thou with i , mephibosheth ?
and he answer , my lord , o king , my servant deceive i : for thy servant say , i will saddle i a ass , that i may ride thereon , and go to the king ; because thy servant be lame .
and he have slandered thy servant unto my lord the king ; but my lord the king be as a angel of god : do therefore what be good in thine eye .
for all of my father 's house be but dead man before my lord the king : yet didst thou set thy servant among they that do eat at thine own table .
what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto the king ?
and the king say unto he , why speakest thou any more of thy matter ?
i have say , thou and ziba divide the land .
and mephibosheth say unto the king , yea , let he take all , forasmuch as my lord the king be come again in peace unto he own house .
and barzillai the gileadite come down from rogelim , and go over jordan with the king , to conduct he over jordan .
now barzillai be a very aged man , even fourscore year old : and he have provide the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim ; for he be a very great man .
and the king say unto barzillai , come thou over with i , and i will feed thee with i in jerusalem .
and barzillai say unto the king , how long have i to live , that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem ?
i be this day fourscore year old : and can i discern between good and evil ? can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink ? can i hear any more the voice of singing man and singing woman ? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king ?
thy servant will go a little way over jordan with the king : and why should the king recompense it i with such a reward ?
let thy servant , i pray thee , turn back again , that i may die in mine own city , and be bury by the grave of my father and of my mother .
but behold thy servant chimham ; let he go over with my lord the king ; and do to he what shall seem good unto thee .
and the king answer , chimham shall go over with i , and i will do to he that which shall seem good unto thee : and whatsoever thou shalt require of i , that will i do for thee .
and all the people go over jordan .
and when the king be come over , the king kiss barzillai , and bless he ; and he return unto he own place .
then the king go on to gilgal , and chimham go on with he : and all the people of judah conduct the king , and also half the people of israel .
and , behold , all the man of israel come to the king , and say unto the king , why have we brethren the man of judah steal thee away , and have bring the king , and he household , and all david 's man with he , over jordan ?
and all the man of judah answer the man of israel , because the king be near of kin to we : wherefore then be ye angry for this matter ? have we eat at all of the king 's cost ? or have he give we any gift ?
and the man of israel answer the man of judah , and say , we have ten part in the king , and we have also more right in david than ye : why then do ye despise we , that we advice should not be first have in bring back we king ?
and the word of the man of judah be fiercer than the word of the man of israel .
and there happen to be there a man of belial , whose name be sheba , the son of bichri , a benjamite : and he blow a trumpet , and say , we have no part in david , neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse : every man to he tent , o israel .
so every man of israel go up from after david , and follow sheba the son of bichri : but the man of judah cleave unto they king , from jordan even to jerusalem .
and david come to he house at jerusalem ; and the king take the ten woman he concubine , whom he have leave to keep the house , and put they in ward , and feed they , but go not in unto they .
so they be shut up unto the day of they death , live in widowhood .
then say the king to amasa , assemble i the man of judah within three day , and be thou here present .
so amasa go to assemble the man of judah : but he tarry longer than the set time which he have appoint he .
and david say to abishai , now shall sheba the son of bichri do we more harm than do absalom : take thou thy lord 's servant , and pursue after he , lest he get he fence city , and escape we .
and there go out after he joab 's man , and the cherethites , and the pelethites , and all the mighty man : and they go out of jerusalem , to pursue after sheba the son of bichri .
when they be at the great stone which be in gibeon , amasa go before they .
and joab 's garment that he have put on be gird unto he , and upon it a girdle with a sword fasten upon he loin in the sheath thereof ; and as he go forth it fall out .
and joab say to amasa , art thou in health , my brother ?
and joab take amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss he .
but amasa take no heed to the sword that be in joab 's hand : so he smite he therewith in the fifth rib , and shed out he bowels to the ground , and strike he not again ; and he die .
so joab and abishai he brother pursue after sheba the son of bichri .
and one of joab 's man stand by he , and say , he that favoureth joab , and he that be for david , let he go after joab .
and amasa wallow in blood in the midst of the highway .
and when the man see that all the people stand still , he remove amasa out of the highway into the field , and cast a cloth upon he , when he see that every one that come by he stand still .
when he be remove out of the highway , all the people go on after joab , to pursue after sheba the son of bichri .
and he go through all the tribe of israel unto abel , and to bethmaachah , and all the berites : and they be gather together , and go also after he .
and they come and besiege he in abel of bethmaachah , and they cast up a bank against the city , and it stand in the trench : and all the people that be with joab batter the wall , to throw it down .
then cry a wise woman out of the city , hear , hear ; say , i pray you , unto joab , come near hither , that i may speak with thee .
and when he be come near unto she , the woman say , art thou joab ?
and he answer , i be he .
then she say unto he , hear the word of thine handmaid .
and he answer , i do hear .
then she speak , say , they be wont to speak in old time , say , they shall surely ask counsel at abel : and so they end the matter .
i be one of they that be peaceable and faithful in israel : thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel : why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord ?
and joab answer and say , far be it , far be it from i , that i should swallow up or destroy .
the matter be not so : but a man of mount ephraim , sheba the son of bichri by name , have lift up he hand against the king , even against david : deliver he only , and i will depart from the city .
and the woman say unto joab , behold , he head shall be throw to thee over the wall .
then the woman go unto all the people in she wisdom .
and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri , and cast it out to joab .
and he blow a trumpet , and they retire from the city , every man to he tent .
and joab return to jerusalem unto the king .
now joab be over all the host of israel : and benaiah the son of jehoiada be over the cherethites and over the pelethites :
and adoram be over the tribute : and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud be recorder :
and sheva be scribe : and zadok and abiathar be the priest :
and ira also the jairite be a chief ruler about david .
then there be a famine in the day of david three year , year after year ; and david enquire of the lord .
and the lord answer , it be for saul , and for he bloody house , because he slew the gibeonites .
and the king call the gibeonites , and say unto they ; ( now the gibeonites be not of the child of israel , but of the remnant of the amorites ; and the child of israel have swear unto they : and saul seek to slay they in he zeal to the child of israel and judah . )
wherefore david say unto the gibeonites , what shall i do for you ? and wherewith shall i make the atonement , that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord ?
and the gibeonites say unto he , we will have no silver nor gold of saul , nor of he house ; neither for we shalt thou kill any man in israel .
and he say , what ye shall say , that will i do for you .
and they answer the king , the man that consume we , and that devise against we that we should be destroy from remain in any of the coast of israel ,
let seven man of he son be deliver unto we , and we will hang they up unto the lord in gibeah of saul , whom the lord do choose .
and the king say , i will give they .
but the king spare mephibosheth , the son of jonathan the son of saul , because of the lord 's oath that be between they , between david and jonathan the son of saul .
but the king take the two son of rizpah the daughter of aiah , whom she bare unto saul , armoni and mephibosheth ; and the five son of michal the daughter of saul , whom she bring up for adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite :
and he deliver they into the hand of the gibeonites , and they hang they in the hill before the lord : and they fall all seven together , and be put to death in the day of harvest , in the first day , in the beginning of barley harvest .
and rizpah the daughter of aiah take sackcloth , and spread it for she upon the rock , from the beginning of harvest until water drop upon they out of heaven , and suffer neither the bird of the air to rest on they by day , nor the beast of the field by night .
and it be tell david what rizpah the daughter of aiah , the concubine of saul , have do .
and david go and take the bone of saul and the bone of jonathan he son from the man of jabeshgilead , which have steal they from the street of bethshan , where the philistines have hang they , when the philistines have slay saul in gilboa :
and he bring up from thence the bone of saul and the bone of jonathan he son ; and they gather the bone of they that be hang .
and the bone of saul and jonathan he son bury they in the country of benjamin in zelah , in the sepulchre of kish he father : and they perform all that the king command .
and after that god be intreat for the land .
moreover the philistines have yet war again with israel ; and david go down , and he servant with he , and fight against the philistines : and david wax faint .
and ishbibenob , which be of the son of the giant , the weight of whose spear weigh three hundred shekel of brass in weight , he be gird with a new sword , think to have slay david .
but abishai the son of zeruiah succour he , and smite the philistine , and kill he .
then the man of david sware unto he , say , thou shalt go no more out with we to battle , that thou quench not the light of israel .
and it come to pass after this , that there be again a battle with the philistine at gob : then sibbechai the hushathite slew saph , which be of the son of the giant .
and there be again a battle in gob with the philistines , where elhanan the son of jaareoregim , a bethlehemite , slew the brother of goliath the gittite , the staff of whose spear be like a weaver 's beam .
and there be yet a battle in gath , where be a man of great stature , that have on every hand six finger , and on every foot six toe , four and twenty in number ; and he also be bear to the giant .
and when he defy israel , jonathan the son of shimeah the brother of david slew he .
these four be bear to the giant in gath , and fall by the hand of david , and by the hand of he servant .
and david spake unto the lord the word of this song in the day that the lord have deliver he out of the hand of all he enemy , and out of the hand of saul :
and he say , the lord be my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ;
the god of my rock ; in he will i trust : he be my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge , my saviour ; thou savest i from violence .
i will call on the lord , who be worthy to be praise : so shall i be save from mine enemy .
when the wave of death compass i , the flood of ungodly man make i afraid ;
the sorrow of hell compass i about ; the snare of death prevent i ;
in my distress i call upon the lord , and cry to my god : and he do hear my voice out of he temple , and my cry do enter into he ear .
then the earth shake and tremble ; the foundation of heaven move and shake , because he be wroth .
there go up a smoke out of he nostril , and fire out of he mouth devour : coal be kindle by it .
he bow the heaven also , and come down ; and darkness be under he foot .
and he ride upon a cherub , and do fly : and he be see upon the wing of the wind .
and he make darkness pavilion round about he , dark water , and thick cloud of the sky .
through the brightness before he be coal of fire kindle .
the lord thunder from heaven , and the most high utter he voice .
and he send out arrow , and scatter they ; lightning , and discomfited they .
and the channel of the sea appear , the foundation of the world be discover , at the rebuking of the lord , at the blast of the breath of he nostril .
he send from above , he take i ; he draw i out of many water ;
he deliver i from my strong enemy , and from they that hate i : for they be too strong for i .
they prevent i in the day of my calamity : but the lord be my stay .
he bring i forth also into a large place : he deliver i , because he delight in i .
the lord reward i accord to my righteousness : accord to the cleanness of my hand have he recompense i .
for i have keep the way of the lord , and have not wickedly depart from my god .
for all he judgment be before i : and as for he statute , i do not depart from they .
i be also upright before he , and have keep myself from mine iniquity .
therefore the lord have recompense i accord to my righteousness ; accord to my cleanness in he eye sight .
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful , and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright .
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure ; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury .
and the afflict people thou wilt save : but thine eye be upon the haughty , that thou mayest bring they down .
for thou art my lamp , o lord : and the lord will lighten my darkness .
for by thee i have run through a troop : by my god have i leap over a wall .
as for god , he way be perfect ; the word of the lord be try : he be a buckler to all they that trust in he .
for who be god , save the lord ? and who be a rock , save we god ?
god be my strength and power : and he maketh my way perfect .
he maketh my foot like hind ' foot : and setteth i upon my high place .
he teacheth my hand to war ; so that a bow of steel be break by mine arm .
thou hast also give i the shield of thy salvation : and thy gentleness have make i great .
thou hast enlarged my step under i ; so that my foot do not slip .
i have pursue mine enemy , and destroy they ; and turn not again until i have consume they .
and i have consume they , and wound they , that they could not arise : yea , they be fall under my foot .
for thou hast gird i with strength to battle : they that rise up against i hast thou subdue under i .
thou hast also give i the neck of mine enemy , that i might destroy they that hate i .
they look , but there be none to save ; even unto the lord , but he answer they not .
then do i beat they as small as the dust of the earth , i do stamp they as the mire of the street , and do spread they abroad .
thou also hast deliver i from the striving of my people , thou hast keep i to be head of the heathen : a people which i know not shall serve i .
stranger shall submit themselves unto i : as soon as they hear , they shall be obedient unto i .
stranger shall fade away , and they shall be afraid out of they close place .
the lord liveth ; and bless be my rock ; and exalt be the god of the rock of my salvation .
it be god that avengeth i , and that bringeth down the people under i ,
and that bringeth i forth from mine enemy : thou also hast lift i up on high above they that rise up against i : thou hast deliver i from the violent man .
therefore i will give thanks unto thee , o lord , among the heathen , and i will sing praise unto thy name .
he be the tower of salvation for he king : and sheweth mercy to he anointed , unto david , and to he seed for evermore .
now these be the last word of david .
david the son of jesse say , and the man who be raise up on high , the anointed of the god of jacob , and the sweet psalmist of israel , say ,
the spirit of the lord spake by i , and he word be in my tongue .
the god of israel say , the rock of israel spake to i , he that ruleth over man must be just , ruling in the fear of god .
and he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun riseth , even a morning without cloud ; as the tender grass spring out of the earth by clear shine after rain .
although my house be not so with god ; yet he have make with i a everlasting covenant , order in all thing , and sure : for this be all my salvation , and all my desire , although he make it not to grow .
but the son of belial shall be all of they as thorn thrust away , because they can not be take with hand :
but the man that shall touch they must be fence with iron and the staff of a spear ; and they shall be utterly burn with fire in the same place .
these be the name of the mighty man whom david have : the tachmonite that sit in the seat , chief among the captain ; the same be adino the eznite : he lift up he spear against eight hundred , whom he slew at one time .
and after he be eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite , one of the three mighty man with david , when they defy the philistine that be there gather together to battle , and the man of israel be go away :
he arise , and smite the philistines until he hand be weary , and he hand clave unto the sword : and the lord work a great victory that day ; and the people return after he only to spoil .
and after he be shammah the son of agee the hararite .
and the philistines be gather together into a troop , where be a piece of ground full of lentile : and the people flee from the philistines .
but he stand in the midst of the ground , and defend it , and slew the philistines : and the lord work a great victory .
and three of the thirty chief go down , and come to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam : and the troop of the philistines pitch in the valley of rephaim .
and david be then in a hold , and the garrison of the philistine be then in bethlehem .
and david long , and say , oh that one would give i drink of the water of the well of bethlehem , which be by the gate !
and the three mighty man brake through the host of the philistines , and draw water out of the well of bethlehem , that be by the gate , and take it , and bring it to david : nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but pour it out unto the lord .
and he say , be it far from i , o lord , that i should do this : be not this the blood of the man that go in jeopardy of they life ? therefore he would not drink it .
these thing do these three mighty man .
and abishai , the brother of joab , the son of zeruiah , be chief among three .
and he lift up he spear against three hundred , and slew they , and have the name among three .
be he not most honourable of three ? therefore he be they captain : howbeit he attain not unto the first three .
and benaiah the son of jehoiada , the son of a valiant man , of kabzeel , who have do many act , he slew two lionlike man of moab : he go down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow :
and he slew a egyptian , a goodly man : and the egyptian have a spear in he hand ; but he go down to he with a staff , and pluck the spear out of the egyptian 's hand , and slew he with he own spear .
these thing do benaiah the son of jehoiada , and have the name among three mighty man .
he be more honourable than the thirty , but he attain not to the first three .
and david set he over he guard .
asahel the brother of joab be one of the thirty ; elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem ,
shammah the harodite , elika the harodite ,
helez the paltite , ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite ,
abiezer the anethothite , mebunnai the hushathite ,
zalmon the ahohite , maharai the netophathite ,
heleb the son of baanah , a netophathite , ittai the son of ribai out of gibeah of the child of benjamin ,
benaiah the pirathonite , hiddai of the brook of gaash ,
abialbon the arbathite , azmaveth the barhumite ,
eliahba the shaalbonite , of the son of jashen , jonathan ,
shammah the hararite , ahiam the son of sharar the hararite ,
eliphelet the son of ahasbai , the son of the maachathite , eliam the son of ahithophel the gilonite ,
hezrai the carmelite , paarai the arbite ,
igal the son of nathan of zobah , bani the gadite ,
zelek the ammonite , nahari the beerothite , armourbearer to joab the son of zeruiah ,
ira a ithrite , gareb a ithrite ,
uriah the hittite : thirty and seven in all .
and again the anger of the lord be kindle against israel , and he move david against they to say , go , number israel and judah .
for the king say to joab the captain of the host , which be with he , go now through all the tribe of israel , from dan even to beersheba , and number ye the people , that i may know the number of the people .
and joab say unto the king , now the lord thy god add unto the people , how many soever they be , a hundredfold , and that the eye of my lord the king may see it : but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing ?
notwithstanding the king 's word prevail against joab , and against the captain of the host .
and joab and the captain of the host go out from the presence of the king , to number the people of israel .
and they pass over jordan , and pitch in aroer , on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad , and toward jazer :
then they come to gilead , and to the land of tahtimhodshi ; and they come to danjaan , and about to zidon ,
and come to the strong hold of tyre , and to all the city of the hivites , and of the canaanites : and they go out to the south of judah , even to beersheba .
so when they have go through all the land , they come to jerusalem at the end of nine month and twenty day .
and joab give up the sum of the number of the people unto the king : and there be in israel eight hundred thousand valiant man that draw the sword ; and the man of judah be five hundred thousand man .
and david 's heart smite he after that he have number the people .
and david say unto the lord , i have sin greatly in that i have do : and now , i beseech thee , o lord , take away the iniquity of thy servant ; for i have do very foolishly .
for when david be up in the morning , the word of the lord come unto the prophet gad , david 's seer , say ,
go and say unto david , thus saith the lord , i offer thee three thing ; choose thee one of they , that i may do it unto thee .
so gad come to david , and tell he , and say unto he , shall seven year of famine come unto thee in thy land ? or wilt thou flee three month before thine enemy , while they pursue thee ? or that there be three day ' pestilence in thy land ? now advise , and see what answer i shall return to he that send i .
and david say unto gad , i be in a great strait : let we fall now into the hand of the lord ; for he mercy be great : and let i not fall into the hand of man .
so the lord send a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appoint : and there die of the people from dan even to beersheba seventy thousand man .
and when the angel stretch out he hand upon jerusalem to destroy it , the lord repent he of the evil , and say to the angel that destroy the people , it be enough : stay now thine hand .
and the angel of the lord be by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite .
and david spake unto the lord when he see the angel that smite the people , and say , lo , i have sin , and i have do wickedly : but these sheep , what have they do ? let thine hand , i pray thee , be against i , and against my father 's house .
and gad come that day to david , and say unto he , go up , rear a altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite .
and david , accord to the say of gad , go up as the lord command .
and araunah look , and see the king and he servant come on toward he : and araunah go out , and bow himself before the king on he face upon the ground .
and araunah say , wherefore be my lord the king come to he servant ?
and david say , to buy the threshingfloor of thee , to build a altar unto the lord , that the plague may be stay from the people .
and araunah say unto david , let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto he : behold , here be oxen for burnt sacrifice , and threshing instrument and other instrument of the ox for wood .
all these thing do araunah , as a king , give unto the king .
and araunah say unto the king , the lord thy god accept thee .
and the king say unto araunah , nay ; but i will surely buy it of thee at a price : neither will i offer burnt offering unto the lord my god of that which doth cost i nothing .
so david buy the threshingfloor and the ox for fifty shekel of silver .
and david build there a altar unto the lord , and offer burnt offering and peace offering .
so the lord be intreat for the land , and the plague be stay from israel .
now king david be old and stricken in year ; and they cover he with clothes , but he gat no heat .
wherefore he servant say unto he , let there be seek for my lord the king a young virgin : and let she stand before the king , and let she cherish he , and let she lie in thy bosom , that my lord the king may get heat .
so they seek for a fair damsel throughout all the coast of israel , and find abishag a shunammite , and bring she to the king .
and the damsel be very fair , and cherish the king , and minister to he : but the king know she not .
then adonijah the son of haggith exalt himself , say , i will be king : and he prepare he chariot and horseman , and fifty man to run before he .
and he father have not displeased he at any time in say , why hast thou do so ? and he also be a very goodly man ; and he mother bare he after absalom .
and he confer with joab the son of zeruiah , and with abiathar the priest : and they follow adonijah help he .
but zadok the priest , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and nathan the prophet , and shimei , and rei , and the mighty man which belong to david , be not with adonijah .
and adonijah slew sheep and ox and fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth , which be by enrogel , and call all he brethren the king 's son , and all the man of judah the king 's servant :
but nathan the prophet , and benaiah , and the mighty man , and solomon he brother , he call not .
wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon , say , hast thou not hear that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign , and david we lord knoweth it not ?
now therefore come , let i , i pray thee , give thee counsel , that thou mayest save thine own life , and the life of thy son solomon .
go and get thee in unto king david , and say unto he , didst not thou , my lord , o king , swear unto thine handmaid , say , assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after i , and he shall sit upon my throne ? why then doth adonijah reign ?
behold , while thou yet talkest there with the king , i also will come in after thee , and confirm thy word .
and bathsheba go in unto the king into the chamber : and the king be very old ; and abishag the shunammite minister unto the king .
and bathsheba bow , and do obeisance unto the king .
and the king say , what wouldest thou ?
and she say unto he , my lord , thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid , say , assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after i , and he shall sit upon my throne .
and now , behold , adonijah reigneth ; and now , my lord the king , thou knowest it not :
and he have slay ox and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and have call all the son of the king , and abiathar the priest , and joab the captain of the host : but solomon thy servant have he not call .
and thou , my lord , o king , the eye of all israel be upon thee , that thou shouldest tell they who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after he .
otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord the king shall sleep with he father , that i and my son solomon shall be count offender .
and , lo , while she yet talk with the king , nathan the prophet also come in .
and they tell the king , say , behold nathan the prophet .
and when he be come in before the king , he bow himself before the king with he face to the ground .
and nathan say , my lord , o king , hast thou say , adonijah shall reign after i , and he shall sit upon my throne ?
for he be go down this day , and have slay ox and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and have call all the king 's son , and the captain of the host , and abiathar the priest ; and , behold , they eat and drink before he , and say , god save king adonijah .
but i , even i thy servant , and zadok the priest , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and thy servant solomon , have he not call .
be this thing do by my lord the king , and thou hast not shew it unto thy servant , who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after he ?
then king david answer and say , call i bathsheba .
and she come into the king 's presence , and stand before the king .
and the king sware , and say , as the lord liveth , that have redeem my soul out of all distress ,
even as i sware unto thee by the lord god of israel , say , assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after i , and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead ; even so will i certainly do this day .
then bathsheba bow with she face to the earth , and do reverence to the king , and say , let my lord king david live for ever .
and king david say , call i zadok the priest , and nathan the prophet , and benaiah the son of jehoiada .
and they come before the king .
the king also say unto they , take with you the servant of you lord , and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule , and bring he down to gihon :
and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint he there king over israel : and blow ye with the trumpet , and say , god save king solomon .
then ye shall come up after he , that he may come and sit upon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and i have appoint he to be ruler over israel and over judah .
and benaiah the son of jehoiada answer the king , and say , amen : the lord god of my lord the king say so too .
as the lord have be with my lord the king , even so be he with solomon , and make he throne greater than the throne of my lord king david .
so zadok the priest , and nathan the prophet , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and the cherethites , and the pelethites , go down , and cause solomon to ride upon king david 's mule , and bring he to gihon .
and zadok the priest take a horn of oil out of the tabernacle , and anoint solomon .
and they blow the trumpet ; and all the people say , god save king solomon .
and all the people come up after he , and the people pipe with pipe , and rejoice with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of they .
and adonijah and all the guest that be with he hear it as they have make a end of eating .
and when joab hear the sound of the trumpet , he say , wherefore be this noise of the city be in a uproar ?
and while he yet speak , behold , jonathan the son of abiathar the priest come ; and adonijah say unto he , come in ; for thou art a valiant man , and bringest good tiding .
and jonathan answer and say to adonijah , verily we lord king david have make solomon king .
and the king have send with he zadok the priest , and nathan the prophet , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and the cherethites , and the pelethites , and they have cause he to ride upon the king 's mule :
and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anoint he king in gihon : and they be come up from thence rejoicing , so that the city ring again .
this be the noise that ye have hear .
and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom .
and moreover the king 's servant come to bless we lord king david , say , god make the name of solomon better than thy name , and make he throne greater than thy throne .
and the king bow himself upon the bed .
and also thus say the king , bless be the lord god of israel , which have give one to sit on my throne this day , mine eye even see it .
and all the guest that be with adonijah be afraid , and rise up , and go every man he way .
and adonijah fear because of solomon , and arise , and go , and catch hold on the horn of the altar .
and it be tell solomon , say , behold , adonijah feareth king solomon : for , lo , he have catch hold on the horn of the altar , say , let king solomon swear unto i today that he will not slay he servant with the sword .
and solomon say , if he will shew himself a worthy man , there shall not a hair of he fall to the earth : but if wickedness shall be find in he , he shall die .
so king solomon send , and they bring he down from the altar .
and he come and bow himself to king solomon : and solomon say unto he , go to thine house .
now the day of david draw nigh that he should die ; and he charge solomon he son , say ,
i go the way of all the earth : be thou strong therefore , and shew thyself a man ;
and keep the charge of the lord thy god , to walk in he way , to keep he statute , and he commandment , and he judgment , and he testimony , as it be write in the law of moses , that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest , and whithersoever thou turnest thyself :
that the lord may continue he word which he speak concern i , say , if thy child take heed to they way , to walk before i in truth with all they heart and with all they soul , there shall not fail thee ( say he ) a man on the throne of israel .
moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah do to i , and what he do to the two captain of the host of israel , unto abner the son of ner , and unto amasa the son of jether , whom he slew , and shed the blood of war in peace , and put the blood of war upon he girdle that be about he loin , and in he shoe that be on he foot .
do therefore accord to thy wisdom , and let not he hoar head go down to the grave in peace .
but shew kindness unto the son of barzillai the gileadite , and let they be of those that eat at thy table : for so they come to i when i flee because of absalom thy brother .
and , behold , thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera , a benjamite of bahurim , which curse i with a grievous curse in the day when i go to mahanaim : but he come down to meet i at jordan , and i sware to he by the lord , say , i will not put thee to death with the sword .
now therefore hold he not guiltless : for thou art a wise man , and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto he ; but he hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood .
so david sleep with he father , and be bury in the city of david .
and the day that david reign over israel be forty year : seven year reign he in hebron , and thirty and three year reign he in jerusalem .
then sit solomon upon the throne of david he father ; and he kingdom be establish greatly .
and adonijah the son of haggith come to bathsheba the mother of solomon .
and she say , comest thou peaceably ?
and he say , peaceably .
he say moreover , i have somewhat to say unto thee .
and she say , say on .
and he say , thou knowest that the kingdom be mine , and that all israel set they face on i , that i should reign : howbeit the kingdom be turn about , and be become my brother 's : for it be he from the lord .
and now i ask one petition of thee , deny i not .
and she say unto he , say on .
and he say , speak , i pray thee , unto solomon the king , ( for he will not say thee nay , ) that he give i abishag the shunammite to wife .
and bathsheba say , well ; i will speak for thee unto the king .
bathsheba therefore go unto king solomon , to speak unto he for adonijah .
and the king rise up to meet she , and bow himself unto she , and sit down on he throne , and cause a seat to be set for the king 's mother ; and she sit on he right hand .
then she say , i desire one small petition of thee ; i pray thee , say i not nay .
and the king say unto she , ask on , my mother : for i will not say thee nay .
and she say , let abishag the shunammite be give to adonijah thy brother to wife .
and king solomon answer and say unto he mother , and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ? ask for he the kingdom also ; for he be mine elder brother ; even for he , and for abiathar the priest , and for joab the son of zeruiah .
then king solomon sware by the lord , say , god do so to i , and more also , if adonijah have not speak this word against he own life .
now therefore , as the lord liveth , which have establish i , and set i on the throne of david my father , and who have make i a house , as he promise , adonijah shall be put to death this day .
and king solomon send by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada ; and he fall upon he that he die .
and unto abiathar the priest say the king , get thee to anathoth , unto thine own field ; for thou art worthy of death : but i will not at this time put thee to death , because thou barest the ark of the lord god before david my father , and because thou hast be afflict in all wherein my father be afflict .
so solomon thrust out abiathar from be priest unto the lord ; that he might fulfil the word of the lord , which he speak concern the house of eli in shiloh .
then tiding come to joab : for joab have turn after adonijah , though he turn not after absalom .
and joab flee unto the tabernacle of the lord , and catch hold on the horn of the altar .
and it be tell king solomon that joab be flee unto the tabernacle of the lord ; and , behold , he be by the altar .
then solomon send benaiah the son of jehoiada , say , go , fall upon he .
and benaiah come to the tabernacle of the lord , and say unto he , thus saith the king , come forth .
and he say , nay ; but i will die here .
and benaiah bring the king word again , say , thus say joab , and thus he answer i .
and the king say unto he , do as he have say , and fall upon he , and bury he ; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood , which joab shed , from i , and from the house of my father .
and the lord shall return he blood upon he own head , who fall upon two man more righteous and better than he , and slew they with the sword , my father david not know thereof , to wit , abner the son of ner , captain of the host of israel , and amasa the son of jether , captain of the host of judah .
they blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab , and upon the head of he seed for ever : but upon david , and upon he seed , and upon he house , and upon he throne , shall there be peace for ever from the lord .
so benaiah the son of jehoiada go up , and fall upon he , and slew he : and he be bury in he own house in the wilderness .
and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in he room over the host : and zadok the priest do the king put in the room of abiathar .
and the king send and call for shimei , and say unto he , build thee a house in jerusalem , and dwell there , and go not forth thence any whither .
for it shall be , that on the day thou goest out , and passest over the brook kidron , thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die : thy blood shall be upon thine own head .
and shimei say unto the king , the say be good : as my lord the king have say , so will thy servant do .
and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many day .
and it come to pass at the end of three year , that two of the servant of shimei run away unto achish son of maachah king of gath .
and they tell shimei , say , behold , thy servant be in gath .
and shimei arise , and saddle he ass , and go to gath to achish to seek he servant : and shimei go , and bring he servant from gath .
and it be tell solomon that shimei have go from jerusalem to gath , and be come again .
and the king send and call for shimei , and say unto he , do i not make thee to swear by the lord , and protest unto thee , say , know for a certain , on the day thou goest out , and walkest abroad any whither , that thou shalt surely die ? and thou saidst unto i , the word that i have hear be good .
why then hast thou not keep the oath of the lord , and the commandment that i have charge thee with ?
the king say moreover to shimei , thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart be privy to , that thou didst to david my father : therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head ;
and king solomon shall be bless , and the throne of david shall be establish before the lord for ever .
so the king command benaiah the son of jehoiada ; which go out , and fall upon he , that he die .
and the kingdom be establish in the hand of solomon .
and solomon make affinity with pharaoh king of egypt , and take pharaoh 's daughter , and bring she into the city of david , until he have make a end of build he own house , and the house of the lord , and the wall of jerusalem round about .
only the people sacrifice in high place , because there be no house build unto the name of the lord , until those day .
and solomon love the lord , walk in the statute of david he father : only he sacrifice and burnt incense in high place .
and the king go to gibeon to sacrifice there ; for that be the great high place : a thousand burnt offering do solomon offer upon that altar .
in gibeon the lord appear to solomon in a dream by night : and god say , ask what i shall give thee .
and solomon say , thou hast shew unto thy servant david my father great mercy , accord as he walk before thee in truth , and in righteousness , and in uprightness of heart with thee ; and thou hast keep for he this great kindness , that thou hast give he a son to sit on he throne , as it be this day .
and now , o lord my god , thou hast make thy servant king instead of david my father : and i be but a little child : i know not how to go out or come in .
and thy servant be in the midst of thy people which thou hast choose , a great people , that can not be number nor count for multitude .
give therefore thy servant a understanding heart to judge thy people , that i may discern between good and bad : for who be able to judge this thy so great a people ?
and the speech please the lord , that solomon have ask this thing .
and god say unto he , because thou hast ask this thing , and hast not ask for thyself long life ; neither hast ask riches for thyself , nor hast ask the life of thine enemy ; but hast ask for thyself understanding to discern judgment ;
behold , i have do accord to thy word : lo , i have give thee a wise and a understanding heart ; so that there be none like thee before thee , neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee .
and i have also give thee that which thou hast not ask , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the king like unto thee all thy day .
and if thou wilt walk in my way , to keep my statute and my commandment , as thy father david do walk , then i will lengthen thy day .
and solomon awake ; and , behold , it be a dream .
and he come to jerusalem , and stand before the ark of the covenant of the lord , and offer up burnt offering , and offer peace offering , and make a feast to all he servant .
then come there two woman , that be harlot , unto the king , and stand before he .
and the one woman say , o my lord , i and this woman dwell in one house ; and i be deliver of a child with she in the house .
and it come to pass the third day after that i be deliver , that this woman be deliver also : and we be together ; there be no stranger with we in the house , save we two in the house .
and this woman 's child die in the night ; because she overlay it .
and she arise at midnight , and take my son from beside i , while thine handmaid sleep , and lay it in she bosom , and lay she dead child in my bosom .
and when i rise in the morning to give my child suck , behold , it be dead : but when i have consider it in the morning , behold , it be not my son , which i do bear .
and the other woman say , nay ; but the living be my son , and the dead be thy son .
and this say , no ; but the dead be thy son , and the living be my son .
thus they speak before the king .
then say the king , the one saith , this be my son that liveth , and thy son be the dead : and the other saith , nay ; but thy son be the dead , and my son be the living .
and the king say , bring i a sword .
and they bring a sword before the king .
and the king say , divide the living child in two , and give half to the one , and half to the other .
then speak the woman whose the living child be unto the king , for she bowels yearn upon she son , and she say , o my lord , give she the living child , and in no wise slay it .
but the other say , let it be neither mine nor thine , but divide it .
then the king answer and say , give she the living child , and in no wise slay it : she be the mother thereof .
and all israel hear of the judgment which the king have judge ; and they fear the king : for they see that the wisdom of god be in he , to do judgment .
so king solomon be king over all israel .
and these be the prince which he have ; azariah the son of zadok the priest ,
elihoreph and ahiah , the son of shisha , scribe ; jehoshaphat the son of ahilud , the recorder .
and benaiah the son of jehoiada be over the host : and zadok and abiathar be the priest :
and azariah the son of nathan be over the officer : and zabud the son of nathan be principal officer , and the king 's friend :
and ahishar be over the household : and adoniram the son of abda be over the tribute .
and solomon have twelve officer over all israel , which provide victuals for the king and he household : each man he month in a year make provision .
and these be they name : the son of hur , in mount ephraim :
the son of dekar , in makaz , and in shaalbim , and bethshemesh , and elonbethhanan :
the son of hesed , in aruboth ; to he pertain sochoh , and all the land of hepher :

baanah the son of hushai be in asher and in aloth :
jehoshaphat the son of paruah , in issachar :
shimei the son of elah , in benjamin :
geber the son of uri be in the country of gilead , in the country of sihon king of the amorites , and of og king of bashan ; and he be the only officer which be in the land .
judah and israel be many , as the sand which be by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking , and make merry .
and solomon reign over all kingdom from the river unto the land of the philistines , and unto the border of egypt : they bring present , and serve solomon all the day of he life .
and solomon 's provision for one day be thirty measure of fine flour , and threescore measure of meal ,
ten fat ox , and twenty ox out of the pasture , and a hundred sheep , beside hart , and roebuck , and fallowdeer , and fat fowl .
for he have dominion over all the region on this side the river , from tiphsah even to azzah , over all the king on this side the river : and he have peace on all side round about he .
and judah and israel dwell safely , every man under he vine and under he fig tree , from dan even to beersheba , all the day of solomon .
and solomon have forty thousand stall of horse for he chariot , and twelve thousand horseman .
and those officer provide victual for king solomon , and for all that come unto king solomon 's table , every man in he month : they lack nothing .
barley also and straw for the horse and dromedary bring they unto the place where the officer be , every man accord to he charge .
and god give solomon wisdom and understanding exceed much , and largeness of heart , even as the sand that be on the sea shore .
and solomon 's wisdom excel the wisdom of all the child of the east country , and all the wisdom of egypt .
for he be wiser than all man ; than ethan the ezrahite , and heman , and chalcol , and darda , the son of mahol : and he fame be in all nation round about .
and he speak three thousand proverb : and he song be a thousand and five .
and he spake of tree , from the cedar tree that be in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall : he speak also of beast , and of fowl , and of creep thing , and of fish .
and there come of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon , from all king of the earth , which have hear of he wisdom .
and hiram king of tyre send he servant unto solomon ; for he have hear that they have anoint he king in the room of he father : for hiram be ever a lover of david .
and solomon send to hiram , say ,
thou knowest how that david my father could not build a house unto the name of the lord he god for the war which be about he on every side , until the lord put they under the sole of he foot .
but now the lord my god have give i rest on every side , so that there be neither adversary nor evil occurrent .
and , behold , i purpose to build a house unto the name of the lord my god , as the lord spake unto david my father , say , thy son , whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room , he shall build a house unto my name .
now therefore command thou that they hew i cedar tree out of lebanon ; and my servant shall be with thy servant : and unto thee will i give hire for thy servant accord to all that thou shalt appoint : for thou knowest that there be not among we any that can skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians .
and it come to pass , when hiram hear the word of solomon , that he rejoice greatly , and say , blessed be the lord this day , which have give unto david a wise son over this great people .
and hiram send to solomon , say , i have consider the thing which thou sentest to i for : and i will do all thy desire concern timber of cedar , and concern timber of fir .
my servant shall bring they down from lebanon unto the sea : and i will convey they by sea in float unto the place that thou shalt appoint i , and will cause they to be discharge there , and thou shalt receive they : and thou shalt accomplish my desire , in give food for my household .
so hiram give solomon cedar tree and fir tree accord to all he desire .
and solomon give hiram twenty thousand measure of wheat for food to he household , and twenty measure of pure oil : thus give solomon to hiram year by year .
and the lord give solomon wisdom , as he promise he : and there be peace between hiram and solomon ; and they two make a league together .
and king solomon raise a levy out of all israel ; and the levy be thirty thousand man .
and he send they to lebanon , ten thousand a month by course : a month they be in lebanon , and two month at home : and adoniram be over the levy .
and solomon have threescore and ten thousand that bare burden , and fourscore thousand hewer in the mountain ;
beside the chief of solomon 's officer which be over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which rule over the people that work in the work .
and the king command , and they bring great stone , costly stone , and hew stone , to lay the foundation of the house .
and solomon 's builder and hiram 's builder do hew they , and the stonesquarer : so they prepare timber and stone to build the house .
and it come to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the child of israel be come out of the land of egypt , in the fourth year of solomon 's reign over israel , in the month zif , which be the second month , that he begin to build the house of the lord .
and the house which king solomon build for the lord , the length thereof be threescore cubit , and the breadth thereof twenty cubit , and the height thereof thirty cubit .
and the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubit be the length thereof , accord to the breadth of the house ; and ten cubit be the breadth thereof before the house .
and for the house he make window of narrow light .
and against the wall of the house he build chamber round about , against the wall of the house round about , both of the temple and of the oracle : and he make chamber round about :
the nethermost chamber be five cubit broad , and the middle be six cubit broad , and the third be seven cubit broad : for without in the wall of the house he make narrow rest round about , that the beam should not be fasten in the wall of the house .
and the house , when it be in building , be build of stone make ready before it be bring thither : so that there be neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron hear in the house , while it be in building .
the door for the middle chamber be in the right side of the house : and they go up with wind stair into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
so he build the house , and finish it ; and cover the house with beam and board of cedar .
and then he build chamber against all the house , five cubit high : and they rest on the house with timber of cedar .
and the word of the lord come to solomon , say ,

and the whole house he overlay with gold , until he have finish all the house : also the whole altar that be by the oracle he overlay with gold .
and within the oracle he make two cherubim of olive tree , each ten cubit high .

and the other cherub be ten cubit : both the cherubim be of one measure and one size .
the height of the one cherub be ten cubit , and so be it of the other cherub .
and he set the cherubim within the inner house : and they stretch forth the wing of the cherubim , so that the wing of the one touch the one wall , and the wing of the other cherub touch the other wall ; and they wing touch one another in the midst of the house .
and he overlay the cherubim with gold .
and he carve all the wall of the house round about with carve figure of cherubim and palm tree and open flower , within and without .
and the floor of the house he overlay with gold , within and without .
and for the enter of the oracle he make door of olive tree : the lintel and side post be a fifth part of the wall .

so also make he for the door of the temple post of olive tree , a fourth part of the wall .
and the two door be of fir tree : the two leaf of the one door be folding , and the two leaf of the other door be folding .
and he carve thereon cherubim and palm tree and open flower : and cover they with gold fit upon the carve work .
and he build the inner court with three row of hew stone , and a row of cedar beam .
in the fourth year be the foundation of the house of the lord lay , in the month zif :
and in the eleventh year , in the month bul , which be the eighth month , be the house finish throughout all the part thereof , and accord to all the fashion of it .

and it be cover with cedar above upon the beam , that lay on forty five pillar , fifteen in a row .

and he make a porch of pillar ; the length thereof be fifty cubit , and the breadth thereof thirty cubit : and the porch be before they : and the other pillar and the thick beam be before they .
then he make a porch for the throne where he might judge , even the porch of judgment : and it be cover with cedar from one side of the floor to the other .
and he house where he dwell have another court within the porch , which be of the like work .

and above be costly stone , after the measure of hew stone , and cedar .
and the great court round about be with three row of hew stone , and a row of cedar beam , both for the inner court of the house of the lord , and for the porch of the house .
and king solomon send and fetch hiram out of tyre .
he be a widow 's son of the tribe of naphtali , and he father be a man of tyre , a worker in brass : and he be fill with wisdom , and understanding , and cunning to work all work in brass .
and he come to king solomon , and work all he work .
for he cast two pillar of brass , of eighteen cubit high apiece : and a line of twelve cubit do compass either of they about .
and he make two chapiter of molten brass , to set upon the top of the pillar : the height of the one chapiter be five cubit , and the height of the other chapiter be five cubit :
and net of checker work , and wreath of chain work , for the chapiter which be upon the top of the pillar ; seven for the one chapiter , and seven for the other chapiter .
and he make the pillar , and two row round about upon the one network , to cover the chapiter that be upon the top , with pomegranate : and so do he for the other chapiter .
and the chapiter that be upon the top of the pillar be of lily work in the porch , four cubit .
and the chapiter upon the two pillar have pomegranate also above , over against the belly which be by the network : and the pomegranate be two hundred in row round about upon the other chapiter .
and he set up the pillar in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and call the name thereof jachin : and he set up the left pillar , and call the name thereof boaz .
and upon the top of the pillar be lily work : so be the work of the pillar finish .
and he make a molten sea , ten cubit from the one brim to the other : it be round all about , and he height be five cubit : and a line of thirty cubit do compass it round about .
and under the brim of it round about there be knop compass it , ten in a cubit , compass the sea round about : the knop be cast in two row , when it be cast .
it stand upon twelve ox , three look toward the north , and three look toward the west , and three look toward the south , and three look toward the east : and the sea be set above upon they , and all they hinder part be inward .
and it be a hand breadth thick , and the brim thereof be work like the brim of a cup , with flower of lily : it contain two thousand bath .
and he make ten basis of brass ; four cubit be the length of one base , and four cubit the breadth thereof , and three cubit the height of it .
and the work of the basis be on this manner : they have border , and the border be between the ledge :
and on the border that be between the ledge be lion , ox , and cherubim : and upon the ledge there be a base above : and beneath the lion and ox be certain addition make of thin work .
and every base have four brasen wheel , and plate of brass : and the four corner thereof have undersetter : under the laver be undersetter molten , at the side of every addition .
and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above be a cubit : but the mouth thereof be round after the work of the base , a cubit and a half : and also upon the mouth of it be graving with they border , foursquare , not round .
and under the border be four wheel ; and the axletree of the wheel be join to the base : and the height of a wheel be a cubit and half a cubit .
and the work of the wheel be like the work of a chariot wheel : they axletree , and they nave , and they felloe , and they spoke , be all molten .
and there be four undersetter to the four corner of one base : and the undersetter be of the very base itself .
and in the top of the base be there a round compass of half a cubit high : and on the top of the base the ledge thereof and the border thereof be of the same .
for on the plate of the ledge thereof , and on the border thereof , he grave cherubim , lion , and palm tree , accord to the proportion of every one , and addition round about .
after this manner he make the ten basis : all of they have one casting , one measure , and one size .
then make he ten laver of brass : one laver contain forty bath : and every laver be four cubit : and upon every one of the ten basis one laver .
and he put five basis on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
and hiram make the laver , and the shovel , and the bason .
so hiram make a end of do all the work that he make king solomon for the house of the lord :

and four hundred pomegranate for the two network , even two row of pomegranate for one network , to cover the two bowl of the chapiter that be upon the pillar ;
and the ten basis , and ten laver on the basis ;
and one sea , and twelve ox under the sea ;
and the pot , and the shovel , and the bason : and all these vessel , which hiram make to king solomon for the house of the lord , be of bright brass .
in the plain of jordan do the king cast they , in the clay ground between succoth and zarthan .
and solomon leave all the vessel unweighed , because they be exceed many : neither be the weight of the brass find out .
and solomon make all the vessel that pertain unto the house of the lord : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , whereupon the shewbread be ,
and the candlestick of pure gold , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the oracle , with the flower , and the lamp , and the tong of gold ,
and the bowl , and the snuffer , and the bason , and the spoon , and the censer of pure gold ; and the hinge of gold , both for the door of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the door of the house , to wit , of the temple .
so be end all the work that king solomon make for the house of the lord .
and solomon bring in the thing which david he father have dedicate ; even the silver , and the gold , and the vessel , do he put among the treasure of the house of the lord .
then solomon assemble the elder of israel , and all the head of the tribe , the chief of the father of the child of israel , unto king solomon in jerusalem , that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david , which be zion .
and all the man of israel assemble themselves unto king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim , which be the seventh month .
and all the elder of israel come , and the priest take up the ark .
and they bring up the ark of the lord , and the tabernacle of the congregation , and all the holy vessel that be in the tabernacle , even those do the priest and the levites bring up .
and king solomon , and all the congregation of israel , that be assemble unto he , be with he before the ark , sacrifice sheep and ox , that could not be tell nor number for multitude .
and the priest bring in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto he place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wing of the cherubim .
for the cherubim spread forth they two wing over the place of the ark , and the cherubim cover the ark and the stave thereof above .
and they draw out the stave , that the end of the stave be see out in the holy place before the oracle , and they be not see without : and there they be unto this day .
there be nothing in the ark save the two table of stone , which mose put there at horeb , when the lord make a covenant with the child of israel , when they come out of the land of egypt .
and it come to pass , when the priest be come out of the holy place , that the cloud fill the house of the lord ,
so that the priest could not stand to minister because of the cloud : for the glory of the lord have fill the house of the lord .
then speak solomon , the lord say that he would dwell in the thick darkness .
i have surely build thee a house to dwell in , a settle place for thee to abide in for ever .
and the king turn he face about , and bless all the congregation of israel : ( and all the congregation of israel stand ; )
and he say , blessed be the lord god of israel , which speak with he mouth unto david my father , and have with he hand fulfil it , say ,
since the day that i bring forth my people israel out of egypt , i choose no city out of all the tribe of israel to build a house , that my name might be therein ; but i choose david to be over my people israel .
and it be in the heart of david my father to build a house for the name of the lord god of israel .
and the lord say unto david my father , whereas it be in thine heart to build a house unto my name , thou didst well that it be in thine heart .
nevertheless thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loin , he shall build the house unto my name .
and the lord have perform he word that he speak , and i be rise up in the room of david my father , and sit on the throne of israel , as the lord promise , and have build a house for the name of the lord god of israel .
and i have set there a place for the ark , wherein be the covenant of the lord , which he make with we father , when he bring they out of the land of egypt .
and solomon stand before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel , and spread forth he hand toward heaven :
and he say , lord god of israel , there be no god like thee , in heaven above , or on earth beneath , who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servant that walk before thee with all they heart :
who hast keep with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst he : thou spakest also with thy mouth , and hast fulfil it with thine hand , as it be this day .
therefore now , lord god of israel , keep with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst he , say , there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel ; so that thy child take heed to they way , that they walk before i as thou hast walk before i .
and now , o god of israel , let thy word , i pray thee , be verify , which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father .
but will god indeed dwell on the earth ? behold , the heaven and heaven of heaven can not contain thee ; how much less this house that i have build ?
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant , and to he supplication , o lord my god , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer , which thy servant prayeth before thee to day :
that thine eye may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which thou hast say , my name shall be there : that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place .
and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant , and of thy people israel , when they shall pray toward this place : and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place : and when thou hearest , forgive .
if any man trespass against he neighbour , and a oath be lay upon he to cause he to swear , and the oath come before thine altar in this house :
then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge thy servant , condemn the wicked , to bring he way upon he head ; and justify the righteous , to give he accord to he righteousness .
when thy people israel be smite down before the enemy , because they have sin against thee , and shall turn again to thee , and confess thy name , and pray , and make supplication unto thee in this house :
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy people israel , and bring they again unto the land which thou gavest unto they father .
when heaven be shut up , and there be no rain , because they have sin against thee ; if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from they sin , when thou afflictest they :
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servant , and of thy people israel , that thou teach they the good way wherein they should walk , and give rain upon thy land , which thou hast give to thy people for a inheritance .
if there be in the land famine , if there be pestilence , blast , mildew , locust , or if there be caterpiller ; if they enemy besiege they in the land of they city ; whatsoever plague , whatsoever sickness there be ;
what prayer and supplication soever be make by any man , or by all thy people israel , which shall know every man the plague of he own heart , and spread forth he hand toward this house :
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man accord to he way , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou , even thou only , knowest the heart of all the child of man ; )
that they may fear thee all the day that they live in the land which thou gavest unto we father .
moreover concern a stranger , that be not of thy people israel , but cometh out of a far country for thy name 's sake ;
( for they shall hear of thy great name , and of thy strong hand , and of thy stretch out arm ; ) when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place , and do accord to all that the stranger calleth to thee for : that all people of the earth may know thy name , to fear thee , as do thy people israel ; and that they may know that this house , which i have build , be call by thy name .
if thy people go out to battle against they enemy , whithersoever thou shalt send they , and shall pray unto the lord toward the city which thou hast choose , and toward the house that i have build for thy name :
then hear thou in heaven they prayer and they supplication , and maintain they cause .
if they sin against thee , ( for there be no man that sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with they , and deliver they to the enemy , so that they carry they away captive unto the land of the enemy , far or near ;
yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they be carry captive , and repent , and make supplication unto thee in the land of they that carry they captive , say , we have sin , and have do perversely , we have commit wickedness ;
and so return unto thee with all they heart , and with all they soul , in the land of they enemy , which lead they away captive , and pray unto thee toward they land , which thou gavest unto they father , the city which thou hast choose , and the house which i have build for thy name :
then hear thou they prayer and they supplication in heaven thy dwelling place , and maintain they cause ,
and forgive thy people that have sin against thee , and all they transgression wherein they have transgress against thee , and give they compassion before they who carry they captive , that they may have compassion on they :
for they be thy people , and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest forth out of egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron :
that thine eye may be open unto the supplication of thy servant , and unto the supplication of thy people israel , to hearken unto they in all that they call for unto thee .
for thou didst separate they from among all the people of the earth , to be thine inheritance , as thou spakest by the hand of moses thy servant , when thou broughtest we father out of egypt , o lord god .
and it be so , that when solomon have make a end of pray all this prayer and supplication unto the lord , he arise from before the altar of the lord , from kneel on he knee with he hand spread up to heaven .
and he stand , and bless all the congregation of israel with a loud voice , say ,
bless be the lord , that have give rest unto he people israel , accord to all that he promise : there have not fail one word of all he good promise , which he promise by the hand of moses he servant .
the lord we god be with we , as he be with we father : let he not leave we , nor forsake we :
that he may incline we heart unto he , to walk in all he way , and to keep he commandment , and he statute , and he judgment , which he command we father .
and let these my word , wherewith i have make supplication before the lord , be nigh unto the lord we god day and night , that he maintain the cause of he servant , and the cause of he people israel at all time , as the matter shall require :
that all the people of the earth may know that the lord be god , and that there be none else .
let you heart therefore be perfect with the lord we god , to walk in he statute , and to keep he commandment , as at this day .
and the king , and all israel with he , offer sacrifice before the lord .
and solomon offer a sacrifice of peace offering , which he offer unto the lord , two and twenty thousand ox , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep .
so the king and all the child of israel dedicate the house of the lord .
the same day do the king hallow the middle of the court that be before the house of the lord : for there he offer burnt offering , and meat offering , and the fat of the peace offering : because the brasen altar that be before the lord be too little to receive the burnt offering , and meat offering , and the fat of the peace offering .
and at that time solomon hold a feast , and all israel with he , a great congregation , from the enter in of hamath unto the river of egypt , before the lord we god , seven day and seven day , even fourteen day .
on the eighth day he send the people away : and they bless the king , and go unto they tent joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord have do for david he servant , and for israel he people .
and it come to pass , when solomon have finish the building of the house of the lord , and the king 's house , and all solomon 's desire which he be please to do ,
that the lord appear to solomon the second time , as he have appear unto he at gibeon .
and the lord say unto he , i have hear thy prayer and thy supplication , that thou hast make before i : i have hallowed this house , which thou hast build , to put my name there for ever ; and mine eye and mine heart shall be there perpetually .
and if thou wilt walk before i , as david thy father walk , in integrity of heart , and in uprightness , to do accord to all that i have command thee , and wilt keep my statute and my judgment :
then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever , as i promise to david thy father , say , there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel .
but if ye shall at all turn from follow i , ye or you child , and will not keep my commandment and my statute which i have set before you , but go and serve other god , and worship they :
then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have give they ; and this house , which i have hallowed for my name , will i cast out of my sight ; and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people :
and at this house , which be high , every one that passeth by it shall be astonish , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , why have the lord do thus unto this land , and to this house ?
and they shall answer , because they forsake the lord they god , who bring forth they father out of the land of egypt , and have take hold upon other god , and have worship they , and serve they : therefore have the lord bring upon they all this evil .
and it come to pass at the end of twenty year , when solomon have build the two house , the house of the lord , and the king 's house ,
( now hiram the king of tyre have furnish solomon with cedar tree and fir tree , and with gold , accord to all he desire , ) that then king solomon give hiram twenty city in the land of galilee .
and hiram come out from tyre to see the city which solomon have give he ; and they please he not .
and he say , what city be these which thou hast give i , my brother ?
and he call they the land of cabul unto this day .
and hiram send to the king sixscore talent of gold .
and this be the reason of the levy which king solomon raise ; for to build the house of the lord , and he own house , and millo , and the wall of jerusalem , and hazor , and megiddo , and gezer .
for pharaoh king of egypt have go up , and take gezer , and burn it with fire , and slay the canaanites that dwell in the city , and give it for a present unto he daughter , solomon 's wife .
and solomon build gezer , and bethhoron the nether ,
and baalath , and tadmor in the wilderness , in the land ,
and all the city of store that solomon have , and city for he chariot , and city for he horseman , and that which solomon desire to build in jerusalem , and in lebanon , and in all the land of he dominion .
and all the people that be leave of the amorites , hittites , perizzites , hivites , and jebusites , which be not of the child of israel ,
they child that be leave after they in the land , whom the child of israel also be not able utterly to destroy , upon those do solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day .
but of the child of israel do solomon make no bondman : but they be man of war , and he servant , and he prince , and he captain , and ruler of he chariot , and he horseman .
these be the chief of the officer that be over solomon 's work , five hundred and fifty , which bare rule over the people that work in the work .
but pharaoh 's daughter come up out of the city of david unto she house which solomon have build for she : then do he build millo .
and three time in a year do solomon offer burnt offering and peace offering upon the altar which he build unto the lord , and he burnt incense upon the altar that be before the lord .
so he finish the house .
and king solomon make a navy of ship in eziongeber , which be beside eloth , on the shore of the red sea , in the land of edom .
and hiram send in the navy he servant , shipman that have knowledge of the sea , with the servant of solomon .
and they come to ophir , and fetch from thence gold , four hundred and twenty talent , and bring it to king solomon .
and when the queen of sheba hear of the fame of solomon concern the name of the lord , she come to prove he with hard question .
and she come to jerusalem with a very great train , with camel that bare spice , and very much gold , and precious stone : and when she be come to solomon , she commune with he of all that be in she heart .
and solomon tell she all she question : there be not any thing hide from the king , which he tell she not .
and when the queen of sheba have see all solomon 's wisdom , and the house that he have build ,
and the meat of he table , and the sit of he servant , and the attendance of he minister , and they apparel , and he cupbearer , and he ascent by which he go up unto the house of the lord ; there be no more spirit in she .
and she say to the king , it be a true report that i hear in mine own land of thy act and of thy wisdom .
howbeit i believe not the word , until i come , and mine eye have see it : and , behold , the half be not tell i : thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i hear .
happy be thy man , happy be these thy servant , which stand continually before thee , and that hear thy wisdom .
bless be the lord thy god , which delight in thee , to set thee on the throne of israel : because the lord love israel for ever , therefore make he thee king , to do judgment and justice .
and she give the king a hundred and twenty talent of gold , and of spice very great store , and precious stone : there come no more such abundance of spice as these which the queen of sheba give to king solomon .
and the navy also of hiram , that bring gold from ophir , bring in from ophir great plenty of almug tree , and precious stone .
and the king make of the almug tree pillar for the house of the lord , and for the king 's house , harp also and psaltery for singer : there come no such almug tree , nor be see unto this day .
and king solomon give unto the queen of sheba all she desire , whatsoever she ask , beside that which solomon give she of he royal bounty .
so she turn and go to she own country , she and she servant .
now the weight of gold that come to solomon in one year be six hundred threescore and six talent of gold ,
beside that he have of the merchantman , and of the traffick of the spice merchant , and of all the king of arabia , and of the governor of the country .
and king solomon make two hundred target of beaten gold : six hundred shekel of gold go to one target .
and he make three hundred shield of beaten gold ; three pound of gold go to one shield : and the king put they in the house of the forest of lebanon .
moreover the king make a great throne of ivory , and overlay it with the best gold .
the throne have six step , and the top of the throne be round behind : and there be stay on either side on the place of the seat , and two lion stand beside the stay .
and twelve lion stand there on the one side and on the other upon the six step : there be not the like make in any kingdom .
and all king solomon 's drinking vessel be of gold , and all the vessel of the house of the forest of lebanon be of pure gold ; none be of silver : it be nothing account of in the day of solomon .
for the king have at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram : once in three year come the navy of tharshish , bring gold , and silver , ivory , and ape , and peacock .
so king solomon exceed all the king of the earth for riches and for wisdom .
and all the earth seek to solomon , to hear he wisdom , which god have put in he heart .
and they bring every man he present , vessel of silver , and vessel of gold , and garment , and armour , and spice , horse , and mule , a rate year by year .
and solomon gather together chariot and horseman : and he have a thousand and four hundred chariot , and twelve thousand horseman , whom he bestow in the city for chariot , and with the king at jerusalem .
and the king make silver to be in jerusalem as stone , and cedar make he to be as the sycomore tree that be in the vale , for abundance .
and solomon have horse bring out of egypt , and linen yarn : the king 's merchant receive the linen yarn at a price .
and a chariot come up and go out of egypt for six hundred shekel of silver , and a horse for a hundred and fifty : and so for all the king of the hittites , and for the king of syria , do they bring they out by they means .
but king solomon love many strange woman , together with the daughter of pharaoh , woman of the moabites , ammonites , edomites , zidonians , and hittites ;
of the nation concern which the lord say unto the child of israel , ye shall not go in to they , neither shall they come in unto you : for surely they will turn away you heart after they god : solomon clave unto these in love .
and he have seven hundred wife , princess , and three hundred concubine : and he wife turn away he heart .
for it come to pass , when solomon be old , that he wife turn away he heart after other god : and he heart be not perfect with the lord he god , as be the heart of david he father .
for solomon go after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians , and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites .
and solomon do evil in the sight of the lord , and go not fully after the lord , as do david he father .
then do solomon build a high place for chemosh , the abomination of moab , in the hill that be before jerusalem , and for molech , the abomination of the child of ammon .
and likewise do he for all he strange wife , which burnt incense and sacrifice unto they god .
and the lord be angry with solomon , because he heart be turn from the lord god of israel , which have appear unto he twice ,
and have command he concern this thing , that he should not go after other god : but he keep not that which the lord command .
wherefore the lord say unto solomon , forasmuch as this be do of thee , and thou hast not keep my covenant and my statute , which i have command thee , i will surely rend the kingdom from thee , and will give it to thy servant .
notwithstanding in thy day i will not do it for david thy father 's sake : but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son .
howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom ; but will give one tribe to thy son for david my servant 's sake , and for jerusalem 's sake which i have choose .
and the lord stir up a adversary unto solomon , hadad the edomite : he be of the king 's seed in edom .
for it come to pass , when david be in edom , and joab the captain of the host be go up to bury the slay , after he have smite every male in edom ;
( for six month do joab remain there with all israel , until he have cut off every male in edom : )
that hadad flee , he and certain edomite of he father 's servant with he , to go into egypt ; hadad be yet a little child .
and they arise out of midian , and come to paran : and they take man with they out of paran , and they come to egypt , unto pharaoh king of egypt ; which give he a house , and appoint he victuals , and give he land .
and hadad find great favour in the sight of pharaoh , so that he give he to wife the sister of he own wife , the sister of tahpenes the queen .
and the sister of tahpenes bare he genubath he son , whom tahpene wean in pharaoh 's house : and genubath be in pharaoh 's household among the son of pharaoh .
and when hadad hear in egypt that david sleep with he father , and that joab the captain of the host be dead , hadad say to pharaoh , let i depart , that i may go to mine own country .
then pharaoh say unto he , but what hast thou lack with i , that , behold , thou seekest to go to thine own country ?
and he answer , nothing : howbeit let i go in any wise .
and god stir he up another adversary , rezon the son of eliadah , which flee from he lord hadadezer king of zobah :
and he gather man unto he , and become captain over a band , when david slew they of zobah : and they go to damascus , and dwelt therein , and reign in damascus .
and he be a adversary to israel all the day of solomon , beside the mischief that hadad do : and he abhor israel , and reign over syria .
and jeroboam the son of nebat , a ephrathite of zereda , solomon 's servant , whose mother 's name be zeruah , a widow woman , even he lift up he hand against the king .
and this be the cause that he lift up he hand against the king : solomon build millo , and repair the breach of the city of david he father .
and the man jeroboam be a mighty man of valour : and solomon see the young man that he be industrious , he make he ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph .
and it come to pass at that time when jeroboam go out of jerusalem , that the prophet ahijah the shilonite find he in the way ; and he have clothe himself with a new garment ; and they two be alone in the field :
and ahijah catch the new garment that be on he , and rent it in twelve piece :
and he say to jeroboam , take thee ten piece : for thus saith the lord , the god of israel , behold , i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon , and will give ten tribe to thee :
( but he shall have one tribe for my servant david 's sake , and for jerusalem 's sake , the city which i have choose out of all the tribe of israel : )
because that they have forsake i , and have worship ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians , chemosh the god of the moabites , and milcom the god of the child of ammon , and have not walk in my way , to do that which be right in mine eye , and to keep my statute and my judgment , as do david he father .
howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of he hand : but i will make he prince all the day of he life for david my servant 's sake , whom i choose , because he keep my commandment and my statute :
but i will take the kingdom out of he son 's hand , and will give it unto thee , even ten tribe .
and unto he son will i give one tribe , that david my servant may have a light alway before i in jerusalem , the city which i have choose i to put my name there .
and i will take thee , and thou shalt reign accord to all that thy soul desireth , and shalt be king over israel .
and it shall be , if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee , and wilt walk in my way , and do that be right in my sight , to keep my statute and my commandment , as david my servant do ; that i will be with thee , and build thee a sure house , as i build for david , and will give israel unto thee .
and i will for this afflict the seed of david , but not for ever .
solomon seek therefore to kill jeroboam .
and jeroboam arise , and flee into egypt , unto shishak king of egypt , and be in egypt until the death of solomon .
and the rest of the act of solomon , and all that he do , and he wisdom , be they not write in the book of the act of solomon ?
and the time that solomon reign in jerusalem over all israel be forty year .
and solomon sleep with he father , and be bury in the city of david he father : and rehoboam he son reign in he stead .
and rehoboam go to shechem : for all israel be come to shechem to make he king .
and it come to pass , when jeroboam the son of nebat , who be yet in egypt , hear of it , ( for he be flee from the presence of king solomon , and jeroboam dwelt in egypt ; )
that they send and call he .
and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel come , and spake unto rehoboam , say ,
thy father make we yoke grievous : now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father , and he heavy yoke which he put upon we , lighter , and we will serve thee .
and he say unto they , depart yet for three day , then come again to i .
and the people depart .
and king rehoboam consult with the old man , that stand before solomon he father while he yet live , and say , how do ye advise that i may answer this people ?
and they speak unto he , say , if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day , and wilt serve they , and answer they , and speak good word to they , then they will be thy servant for ever .
but he forsake the counsel of the old man , which they have give he , and consult with the young man that be grow up with he , and which stand before he :
and he say unto they , what counsel give ye that we may answer this people , who have speak to i , say , make the yoke which thy father do put upon we lighter ?
and the young man that be grow up with he speak unto he , say , thus shalt thou speak unto this people that speak unto thee , say , thy father make we yoke heavy , but make thou it lighter unto we ; thus shalt thou say unto they , my little finger shall be thicker than my father 's loin .
and now whereas my father do lade you with a heavy yoke , i will add to you yoke : my father have chastise you with whip , but i will chastise you with scorpion .
so jeroboam and all the people come to rehoboam the third day , as the king have appoint , say , come to i again the third day .
and the king answer the people roughly , and forsake the old man 's counsel that they give he ;
and spake to they after the counsel of the young man , say , my father make you yoke heavy , and i will add to you yoke : my father also chastise you with whip , but i will chastise you with scorpion .
wherefore the king hearken not unto the people ; for the cause be from the lord , that he might perform he say , which the lord spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat .
so when all israel see that the king hearken not unto they , the people answer the king , say , what portion have we in david ? neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse : to you tent , o israel : now see to thine own house , david .
so israel depart unto they tent .
but as for the child of israel which dwell in the city of judah , rehoboam reign over they .
then king rehoboam send adoram , who be over the tribute ; and all israel stone he with stone , that he die .
therefore king rehoboam make speed to get he up to he chariot , to flee to jerusalem .
so israel rebel against the house of david unto this day .
and it come to pass , when all israel hear that jeroboam be come again , that they send and call he unto the congregation , and make he king over all israel : there be none that follow the house of david , but the tribe of judah only .
and when rehoboam be come to jerusalem , he assemble all the house of judah , with the tribe of benjamin , a hundred and fourscore thousand choose man , which be warrior , to fight against the house of israel , to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon .
but the word of god come unto shemaiah the man of god , say ,
speak unto rehoboam , the son of solomon , king of judah , and unto all the house of judah and benjamin , and to the remnant of the people , say ,
thus saith the lord , ye shall not go up , nor fight against you brethren the child of israel : return every man to he house ; for this thing be from i .
they hearken therefore to the word of the lord , and return to depart , accord to the word of the lord .
then jeroboam build shechem in mount ephraim , and dwelt therein ; and go out from thence , and build penuel .
and jeroboam say in he heart , now shall the kingdom return to the house of david :
if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the lord at jerusalem , then shall the heart of this people turn again unto they lord , even unto rehoboam king of judah , and they shall kill i , and go again to rehoboam king of judah .
whereupon the king take counsel , and make two calf of gold , and say unto they , it be too much for you to go up to jerusalem : behold thy god , o israel , which bring thee up out of the land of egypt .
and he set the one in bethel , and the other put he in dan .
and this thing become a sin : for the people go to worship before the one , even unto dan .
and he make a house of high place , and make priest of the lowest of the people , which be not of the son of levi .
and jeroboam ordain a feast in the eighth month , on the fifteenth day of the month , like unto the feast that be in judah , and he offer upon the altar .
so do he in bethel , sacrifice unto the calf that he have make : and he place in bethel the priest of the high place which he have make .
so he offer upon the altar which he have make in bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month , even in the month which he have devise of he own heart ; and ordain a feast unto the child of israel : and he offer upon the altar , and burnt incense .
and , behold , there come a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel : and jeroboam stand by the altar to burn incense .
and he cry against the altar in the word of the lord , and say , o altar , altar , thus saith the lord ; behold , a child shall be bear unto the house of david , josiah by name ; and upon thee shall he offer the priest of the high place that burn incense upon thee , and man 's bone shall be burn upon thee .
and he give a sign the same day , say , this be the sign which the lord have speak ; behold , the altar shall be rent , and the ash that be upon it shall be pour out .
and it come to pass , when king jeroboam hear the say of the man of god , which have cry against the altar in bethel , that he put forth he hand from the altar , say , lay hold on he .
and he hand , which he put forth against he , dry up , so that he could not pull it in again to he .
the altar also be rent , and the ash pour out from the altar , accord to the sign which the man of god have give by the word of the lord .
and the king answer and say unto the man of god , intreat now the face of the lord thy god , and pray for i , that my hand may be restore i again .
and the man of god beseech the lord , and the king 's hand be restore he again , and become as it be before .
and the king say unto the man of god , come home with i , and refresh thyself , and i will give thee a reward .
and the man of god say unto the king , if thou wilt give i half thine house , i will not go in with thee , neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place :
for so be it charge i by the word of the lord , say , eat no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that thou camest .
so he go another way , and return not by the way that he come to bethel .
now there dwell a old prophet in bethel ; and he son come and tell he all the work that the man of god have do that day in bethel : the word which he have speak unto the king , they they tell also to they father .
and they father say unto they , what way go he ?
for he son have see what way the man of god go , which come from judah .
and he say unto he son , saddle i the ass .
so they saddle he the ass : and he ride thereon ,
and go after the man of god , and find he sit under a oak : and he say unto he , art thou the man of god that camest from judah ?
and he say , i be .
then he say unto he , come home with i , and eat bread .
and he say , i may not return with thee , nor go in with thee : neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place :
for it be say to i by the word of the lord , thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest .
he say unto he , i be a prophet also as thou art ; and a angel spake unto i by the word of the lord , say , bring he back with thee into thine house , that he may eat bread and drink water .
but he lie unto he .
so he go back with he , and do eat bread in he house , and drink water .
and it come to pass , as they sit at the table , that the word of the lord come unto the prophet that bring he back :
and he cry unto the man of god that come from judah , say , thus saith the lord , forasmuch as thou hast disobey the mouth of the lord , and hast not keep the commandment which the lord thy god command thee ,
but camest back , and hast eat bread and drunk water in the place , of the which the lord do say to thee , eat no bread , and drink no water ; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy father .
and it come to pass , after he have eat bread , and after he have drunk , that he saddle for he the ass , to wit , for the prophet whom he have bring back .
and when he be go , a lion meet he by the way , and slew he : and he carcase be cast in the way , and the ass stand by it , the lion also stand by the carcase .
and , behold , man pass by , and see the carcase cast in the way , and the lion standing by the carcase : and they come and tell it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .
and when the prophet that bring he back from the way hear thereof , he say , it be the man of god , who be disobedient unto the word of the lord : therefore the lord have deliver he unto the lion , which have tear he , and slay he , accord to the word of the lord , which he speak unto he .
and he speak to he son , say , saddle i the ass .
and they saddle he .
and he go and find he carcase cast in the way , and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase : the lion have not eat the carcase , nor tear the ass .
and the prophet take up the carcase of the man of god , and lay it upon the ass , and bring it back : and the old prophet come to the city , to mourn and to bury he .
and he lay he carcase in he own grave ; and they mourn over he , say , alas , my brother !
and it come to pass , after he have bury he , that he speak to he son , say , when i be dead , then bury i in the sepulchre wherein the man of god be bury ; lay my bone beside he bone :
for the say which he cry by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel , and against all the house of the high place which be in the city of samaria , shall surely come to pass .
after this thing jeroboam return not from he evil way , but make again of the lowest of the people priest of the high place : whosoever would , he consecrate he , and he become one of the priest of the high place .
and this thing become sin unto the house of jeroboam , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the face of the earth .
at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fall sick .
and jeroboam say to he wife , arise , i pray thee , and disguise thyself , that thou be not know to be the wife of jeroboam ; and get thee to shiloh : behold , there be ahijah the prophet , which tell i that i should be king over this people .
and take with thee ten loaf , and cracknel , and a cruse of honey , and go to he : he shall tell thee what shall become of the child .
and jeroboam 's wife do so , and arise , and go to shiloh , and come to the house of ahijah .
but ahijah could not see ; for he eye be set by reason of he age .
and the lord say unto ahijah , behold , the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for she son ; for he be sick : thus and thus shalt thou say unto she : for it shall be , when she cometh in , that she shall feign herself to be another woman .
and it be so , when ahijah hear the sound of she foot , as she come in at the door , that he say , come in , thou wife of jeroboam ; why feignest thou thyself to be another ? for i be send to thee with heavy tiding .
go , tell jeroboam , thus saith the lord god of israel , forasmuch as i exalt thee from among the people , and make thee prince over my people israel ,
and rent the kingdom away from the house of david , and give it thee : and yet thou hast not be as my servant david , who keep my commandment , and who follow i with all he heart , to do that only which be right in mine eye ;
but hast do evil above all that be before thee : for thou hast go and make thee other god , and molten image , to provoke i to anger , and hast cast i behind thy back :
therefore , behold , i will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam , and will cut off from jeroboam he that pisseth against the wall , and he that be shut up and leave in israel , and will take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam , as a man taketh away dung , till it be all go .
he that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dog eat ; and he that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the air eat : for the lord have speak it .
arise thou therefore , get thee to thine own house : and when thy foot enter into the city , the child shall die .
and all israel shall mourn for he , and bury he : for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave , because in he there be find some good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam .
moreover the lord shall raise he up a king over israel , who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day : but what ? even now .
for the lord shall smite israel , as a reed be shake in the water , and he shall root up israel out of this good land , which he give to they father , and shall scatter they beyond the river , because they have make they grove , provoke the lord to anger .
and he shall give israel up because of the sin of jeroboam , who do sin , and who make israel to sin .
and jeroboam 's wife arise , and depart , and come to tirzah : and when she come to the threshold of the door , the child die ;
and they bury he ; and all israel mourn for he , accord to the word of the lord , which he speak by the hand of he servant ahijah the prophet .
and the rest of the act of jeroboam , how he war , and how he reign , behold , they be write in the book of the chronicle of the king of israel .
and the day which jeroboam reign be two and twenty year : and he sleep with he father , and nadab he son reign in he stead .
and rehoboam the son of solomon reign in judah .
rehoboam be forty and one year old when he begin to reign , and he reign seventeen year in jerusalem , the city which the lord do choose out of all the tribe of israel , to put he name there .
and he mother 's name be naamah a ammonitess .
and judah do evil in the sight of the lord , and they provoke he to jealousy with they sin which they have commit , above all that they father have do .
for they also build they high place , and image , and grove , on every high hill , and under every green tree .
and there be also sodomite in the land : and they do accord to all the abomination of the nation which the lord cast out before the child of israel .
and it come to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam , that shishak king of egypt come up against jerusalem :
and he take away the treasure of the house of the lord , and the treasure of the king 's house ; he even take away all : and he take away all the shield of gold which solomon have make .
and king rehoboam make in they stead brasen shield , and commit they unto the hand of the chief of the guard , which keep the door of the king 's house .
and it be so , when the king go into the house of the lord , that the guard bare they , and bring they back into the guard chamber .
now the rest of the act of rehoboam , and all that he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
and there be war between rehoboam and jeroboam all they day .
and rehoboam sleep with he father , and be bury with he father in the city of david .
and he mother 's name be naamah a ammonitess .
and abijam he son reign in he stead .
now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat reign abijam over judah .
three year reign he in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be maachah , the daughter of abishalom .
and he walk in all the sin of he father , which he have do before he : and he heart be not perfect with the lord he god , as the heart of david he father .
nevertheless for david 's sake do the lord he god give he a lamp in jerusalem , to set up he son after he , and to establish jerusalem :
because david do that which be right in the eye of the lord , and turn not aside from any thing that he command he all the day of he life , save only in the matter of uriah the hittite .
and there be war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the day of he life .
now the rest of the act of abijam , and all that he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
and there be war between abijam and jeroboam .
and abijam sleep with he father ; and they bury he in the city of david : and asa he son reign in he stead .
and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel reign asa over judah .
and forty and one year reign he in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be maachah , the daughter of abishalom .
and asa do that which be right in the eye of the lord , as do david he father .
and he take away the sodomite out of the land , and remove all the idol that he father have make .
and also maachah he mother , even she he remove from be queen , because she have make a idol in a grove ; and asa destroy she idol , and burn it by the brook kidron .
but the high place be not remove : nevertheless asa 's heart be perfect with the lord all he day .
and he bring in the thing which he father have dedicate , and the thing which himself have dedicate , into the house of the lord , silver , and gold , and vessel .
and there be war between asa and baasha king of israel all they day .
and baasha king of israel go up against judah , and build ramah , that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king of judah .
then asa take all the silver and the gold that be leave in the treasure of the house of the lord , and the treasure of the king 's house , and deliver they into the hand of he servant : and king asa send they to benhadad , the son of tabrimon , the son of hezion , king of syria , that dwelt at damascus , say ,
there be a league between i and thee , and between my father and thy father : behold , i have send unto thee a present of silver and gold ; come and break thy league with baasha king of israel , that he may depart from i .
so benhadad hearken unto king asa , and send the captain of the host which he have against the city of israel , and smite ijon , and dan , and abelbethmaachah , and all cinneroth , with all the land of naphtali .
and it come to pass , when baasha hear thereof , that he leave off building of ramah , and dwelt in tirzah .
then king asa make a proclamation throughout all judah ; none be exempt : and they take away the stone of ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith baasha have build ; and king asa build with they geba of benjamin , and mizpah .
the rest of all the act of asa , and all he might , and all that he do , and the city which he build , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
nevertheless in the time of he old age he be diseased in he foot .
and asa sleep with he father , and be bury with he father in the city of david he father : and jehoshaphat he son reign in he stead .
and nadab the son of jeroboam begin to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah , and reign over israel two year .
and he do evil in the sight of the lord , and walk in the way of he father , and in he sin wherewith he make israel to sin .
and baasha the son of ahijah , of the house of issachar , conspire against he ; and baasha smite he at gibbethon , which belong to the philistines ; for nadab and all israel lay siege to gibbethon .
even in the third year of asa king of judah do baasha slay he , and reign in he stead .
and it come to pass , when he reign , that he smite all the house of jeroboam ; he leave not to jeroboam any that breathe , until he have destroy he , accord unto the say of the lord , which he speak by he servant ahijah the shilonite :
because of the sin of jeroboam which he sin , and which he make israel sin , by he provocation wherewith he provoke the lord god of israel to anger .
now the rest of the act of nadab , and all that he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of israel ?
and there be war between asa and baasha king of israel all they day .
in the third year of asa king of judah begin baasha the son of ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah , twenty and four year .
and he do evil in the sight of the lord , and walk in the way of jeroboam , and in he sin wherewith he make israel to sin .
then the word of the lord come to jehu the son of hanani against baasha , say ,
forasmuch as i exalt thee out of the dust , and make thee prince over my people israel ; and thou hast walk in the way of jeroboam , and hast make my people israel to sin , to provoke i to anger with they sin ;
behold , i will take away the posterity of baasha , and the posterity of he house ; and will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat .
he that dieth of baasha in the city shall the dog eat ; and he that dieth of he in the field shall the fowl of the air eat .
now the rest of the act of baasha , and what he do , and he might , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of israel ?
so baasha sleep with he father , and be bury in tirzah : and elah he son reign in he stead .
and also by the hand of the prophet jehu the son of hanani come the word of the lord against baasha , and against he house , even for all the evil that he do in the sight of the lord , in provoke he to anger with the work of he hand , in be like the house of jeroboam ; and because he kill he .
in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah begin elah the son of baasha to reign over israel in tirzah , two year .
and he servant zimri , captain of half he chariot , conspire against he , as he be in tirzah , drink himself drunk in the house of arza steward of he house in tirzah .
and zimri go in and smite he , and kill he , in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah , and reign in he stead .
and it come to pass , when he begin to reign , as soon as he sit on he throne , that he slew all the house of baasha : he leave he not one that pisseth against a wall , neither of he kinsfolk , nor of he friend .
thus do zimri destroy all the house of baasha , accord to the word of the lord , which he speak against baasha by jehu the prophet ,
for all the sin of baasha , and the sin of elah he son , by which they sin , and by which they make israel to sin , in provoke the lord god of israel to anger with they vanity .
now the rest of the act of elah , and all that he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of israel ?
in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah do zimri reign seven day in tirzah .
and the people be encamp against gibbethon , which belong to the philistines .
and the people that be encamp hear say , zimri have conspire , and have also slay the king : wherefore all israel make omri , the captain of the host , king over israel that day in the camp .
and omri go up from gibbethon , and all israel with he , and they besiege tirzah .
and it come to pass , when zimri see that the city be take , that he go into the palace of the king 's house , and burn the king 's house over he with fire , and die ,
for he sin which he sin in do evil in the sight of the lord , in walk in the way of jeroboam , and in he sin which he do , to make israel to sin .
now the rest of the act of zimri , and he treason that he work , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of israel ?
then be the people of israel divide into two part : half of the people follow tibni the son of ginath , to make he king ; and half follow omri .
but the people that follow omri prevail against the people that follow tibni the son of ginath : so tibni die , and omri reign .
in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah begin omri to reign over israel , twelve year : six year reign he in tirzah .
and he buy the hill samarium of shemer for two talent of silver , and build on the hill , and call the name of the city which he build , after the name of shemer , owner of the hill , samaria .
but omri work evil in the eye of the lord , and do worse than all that be before he .
for he walk in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat , and in he sin wherewith he make israel to sin , to provoke the lord god of israel to anger with they vanity .
now the rest of the act of omri which he do , and he might that he shew , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of israel ?
so omri sleep with he father , and be bury in samaria : and ahab he son reign in he stead .
and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah begin ahab the son of omri to reign over israel : and ahab the son of omri reign over israel in samaria twenty and two year .
and ahab the son of omri do evil in the sight of the lord above all that be before he .
and it come to pass , as if it have be a light thing for he to walk in the sin of jeroboam the son of nebat , that he take to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians , and go and serve baal , and worship he .
and he rear up a altar for baal in the house of baal , which he have build in samaria .
and ahab make a grove ; and ahab do more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the king of israel that be before he .
in he day do hiel the bethelite build jericho : he lay the foundation thereof in abiram he firstborn , and set up the gate thereof in he youngest son segub , accord to the word of the lord , which he speak by joshua the son of nun .
and elijah the tishbite , who be of the inhabitant of gilead , say unto ahab , as the lord god of israel liveth , before whom i stand , there shall not be dew nor rain these year , but accord to my word .
and the word of the lord come unto he , say ,
get thee hence , and turn thee eastward , and hide thyself by the brook cherith , that be before jordan .
and it shall be , that thou shalt drink of the brook ; and i have command the raven to feed thee there .
so he go and do accord unto the word of the lord : for he go and dwell by the brook cherith , that be before jordan .
and the raven bring he bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the evening ; and he drink of the brook .
and it come to pass after a while , that the brook dry up , because there have be no rain in the land .
and the word of the lord come unto he , say ,
arise , get thee to zarephath , which belongeth to zidon , and dwell there : behold , i have command a widow woman there to sustain thee .
so he arise and go to zarephath .
and when he come to the gate of the city , behold , the widow woman be there gathering of stick : and he call to she , and say , fetch i , i pray thee , a little water in a vessel , that i may drink .
and as she be go to fetch it , he call to she , and say , bring i , i pray thee , a morsel of bread in thine hand .
and she say , as the lord thy god liveth , i have not a cake , but a handful of meal in a barrel , and a little oil in a cruse : and , behold , i be gather two stick , that i may go in and dress it for i and my son , that we may eat it , and die .
and elijah say unto she , fear not ; go and do as thou hast say : but make i thereof a little cake first , and bring it unto i , and after make for thee and for thy son .
for thus saith the lord god of israel , the barrel of meal shall not waste , neither shall the cruse of oil fail , until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth .
and she go and do accord to the say of elijah : and she , and he , and she house , do eat many day .
and the barrel of meal waste not , neither do the cruse of oil fail , accord to the word of the lord , which he speak by elijah .
and it come to pass after these thing , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fall sick ; and he sickness be so sore , that there be no breath leave in he .
and she say unto elijah , what have i to do with thee , o thou man of god ? art thou come unto i to call my sin to remembrance , and to slay my son ?
and he say unto she , give i thy son .
and he take he out of she bosom , and carry he up into a loft , where he abode , and lay he upon he own bed .
and he cry unto the lord , and say , o lord my god , hast thou also bring evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn , by slaying she son ?
and he stretch himself upon the child three time , and cry unto the lord , and say , o lord my god , i pray thee , let this child 's soul come into he again .
and the lord hear the voice of elijah ; and the soul of the child come into he again , and he revive .
and elijah take the child , and bring he down out of the chamber into the house , and deliver he unto he mother : and elijah say , see , thy son liveth .
and the woman say to elijah , now by this i know that thou art a man of god , and that the word of the lord in thy mouth be truth .
and it come to pass after many day , that the word of the lord come to elijah in the third year , say , go , shew thyself unto ahab ; and i will send rain upon the earth .
and elijah go to shew himself unto ahab .
and there be a sore famine in samaria .
and ahab call obadiah , which be the governor of he house .
( now obadiah fear the lord greatly :
for it be so , when jezebel cut off the prophet of the lord , that obadiah take a hundred prophet , and hide they by fifty in a cave , and feed they with bread and water . )
and ahab say unto obadiah , go into the land , unto all fountain of water , and unto all brook : peradventure we may find grass to save the horse and mule alive , that we lose not all the beast .
so they divide the land between they to pass throughout it : ahab go one way by himself , and obadiah go another way by himself .
and as obadiah be in the way , behold , elijah meet he : and he know he , and fall on he face , and say , art thou that my lord elijah ?
and he answer he , i be : go , tell thy lord , behold , elijah be here .
and he say , what have i sin , that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab , to slay i ?
as the lord thy god liveth , there be no nation or kingdom , whither my lord have not send to seek thee : and when they say , he be not there ; he take a oath of the kingdom and nation , that they find thee not .
and now thou sayest , go , tell thy lord , behold , elijah be here .
and it shall come to pass , as soon as i be go from thee , that the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not ; and so when i come and tell ahab , and he can not find thee , he shall slay i : but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth .
be it not tell my lord what i do when jezebel slew the prophet of the lord , how i hide a hundred man of the lord 's prophet by fifty in a cave , and feed they with bread and water ?
and now thou sayest , go , tell thy lord , behold , elijah be here : and he shall slay i .
and elijah say , as the lord of host liveth , before whom i stand , i will surely shew myself unto he to day .
so obadiah go to meet ahab , and tell he : and ahab go to meet elijah .
and it come to pass , when ahab see elijah , that ahab say unto he , art thou he that troubleth israel ?
and he answer , i have not trouble israel ; but thou , and thy father 's house , in that ye have forsake the commandment of the lord , and thou hast follow baalim .
now therefore send , and gather to i all israel unto mount carmel , and the prophet of baal four hundred and fifty , and the prophet of the grove four hundred , which eat at jezebel 's table .
so ahab send unto all the child of israel , and gather the prophet together unto mount carmel .
and elijah come unto all the people , and say , how long halt ye between two opinion ? if the lord be god , follow he : but if baal , then follow he .
and the people answer he not a word .
then say elijah unto the people , i , even i only , remain a prophet of the lord ; but baal 's prophet be four hundred and fifty man .
let they therefore give we two bullock ; and let they choose one bullock for themselves , and cut it in piece , and lay it on wood , and put no fire under : and i will dress the other bullock , and lay it on wood , and put no fire under :
and call ye on the name of you god , and i will call on the name of the lord : and the god that answereth by fire , let he be god .
and all the people answer and say , it be well speak .
and elijah say unto the prophet of baal , choose you one bullock for yourselve , and dress it first ; for ye be many ; and call on the name of you god , but put no fire under .
and they take the bullock which be give they , and they dress it , and call on the name of baal from morning even until noon , say , o baal , hear we .
but there be no voice , nor any that answer .
and they leap upon the altar which be make .
and it come to pass at noon , that elijah mock they , and say , cry aloud : for he be a god ; either he be talk , or he be pursue , or he be in a journey , or peradventure he sleepeth , and must be awake .
and they cry aloud , and cut themselves after they manner with knife and lancet , till the blood gush out upon they .
and it come to pass , when midday be past , and they prophesy until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that there be neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regard .
and elijah say unto all the people , come near unto i .
and all the people come near unto he .
and he repair the altar of the lord that be break down .
and elijah take twelve stone , accord to the number of the tribe of the son of jacob , unto whom the word of the lord come , say , israel shall be thy name :
and with the stone he build a altar in the name of the lord : and he make a trench about the altar , as great as would contain two measure of seed .
and he put the wood in order , and cut the bullock in piece , and lay he on the wood , and say , fill four barrel with water , and pour it on the burnt sacrifice , and on the wood .
and he say , do it the second time .
and they do it the second time .
and he say , do it the third time .
and they do it the third time .
and the water run round about the altar ; and he fill the trench also with water .
and it come to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that elijah the prophet come near , and say , lord god of abraham , isaac , and of israel , let it be know this day that thou art god in israel , and that i be thy servant , and that i have do all these thing at thy word .
hear i , o lord , hear i , that this people may know that thou art the lord god , and that thou hast turn they heart back again .
then the fire of the lord fall , and consume the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stone , and the dust , and lick up the water that be in the trench .
and when all the people see it , they fall on they face : and they say , the lord , he be the god ; the lord , he be the god .
and elijah say unto they , take the prophet of baal ; let not one of they escape .
and they take they : and elijah bring they down to the brook kishon , and slew they there .
and elijah say unto ahab , get thee up , eat and drink ; for there be a sound of abundance of rain .
so ahab go up to eat and to drink .
and elijah go up to the top of carmel ; and he cast himself down upon the earth , and put he face between he knee ,
and say to he servant , go up now , look toward the sea .
and he go up , and look , and say , there be nothing .
and he say , go again seven time .
and it come to pass at the seventh time , that he say , behold , there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea , like a man 's hand .
and he say , go up , say unto ahab , prepare thy chariot , and get thee down , that the rain stop thee not .
and it come to pass in the mean while , that the heaven be black with cloud and wind , and there be a great rain .
and ahab ride , and go to jezreel .
and the hand of the lord be on elijah ; and he gird up he loin , and run before ahab to the entrance of jezreel .
and ahab tell jezebel all that elijah have do , and withal how he have slay all the prophet with the sword .
then jezebel send a messenger unto elijah , say , so let the god do to i , and more also , if i make not thy life as the life of one of they by to morrow about this time .
and when he see that , he arise , and go for he life , and come to beersheba , which belongeth to judah , and leave he servant there .
but he himself go a day 's journey into the wilderness , and come and sit down under a juniper tree : and he request for himself that he might die ; and say , it be enough ; now , o lord , take away my life ; for i be not better than my father .
and as he lay and sleep under a juniper tree , behold , then a angel touch he , and say unto he , arise and eat .
and he look , and , behold , there be a cake baken on the coal , and a cruse of water at he head .
and he do eat and drink , and lay he down again .
and the angel of the lord come again the second time , and touch he , and say , arise and eat ; because the journey be too great for thee .
and he arise , and do eat and drink , and go in the strength of that meat forty day and forty night unto horeb the mount of god .
and he come thither unto a cave , and lodge there ; and , behold , the word of the lord come to he , and he say unto he , what doest thou here , elijah ?
and he say , i have be very jealous for the lord god of host : for the child of israel have forsake thy covenant , throw down thine altar , and slay thy prophet with the sword ; and i , even i only , be leave ; and they seek my life , to take it away .
and he say , go forth , and stand upon the mount before the lord .
and , behold , the lord pass by , and a great and strong wind rent the mountain , and brake in piece the rock before the lord ; but the lord be not in the wind : and after the wind a earthquake ; but the lord be not in the earthquake :
and after the earthquake a fire ; but the lord be not in the fire : and after the fire a still small voice .
and it be so , when elijah hear it , that he wrap he face in he mantle , and go out , and stand in the enter in of the cave .
and , behold , there come a voice unto he , and say , what doest thou here , elijah ?
and he say , i have be very jealous for the lord god of host : because the child of israel have forsake thy covenant , throw down thine altar , and slay thy prophet with the sword ; and i , even i only , be leave ; and they seek my life , to take it away .
and the lord say unto he , go , return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus : and when thou comest , anoint hazael to be king over syria :
and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel : and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room .
and it shall come to pass , that he that escapeth the sword of hazael shall jehu slay : and he that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay .
yet i have leave i seven thousand in israel , all the knee which have not bow unto baal , and every mouth which have not kiss he .
so he depart thence , and find elisha the son of shaphat , who be plow with twelve yoke of ox before he , and he with the twelfth : and elijah pass by he , and cast he mantle upon he .
and he leave the ox , and run after elijah , and say , let i , i pray thee , kiss my father and my mother , and then i will follow thee .
and he say unto he , go back again : for what have i do to thee ?
and he return back from he , and take a yoke of ox , and slew they , and boil they flesh with the instrument of the ox , and give unto the people , and they do eat .
then he arise , and go after elijah , and minister unto he .
and benhadad the king of syria gather all he host together : and there be thirty and two king with he , and horse , and chariot ; and he go up and besiege samaria , and war against it .
and he send messenger to ahab king of israel into the city , and say unto he , thus saith benhadad ,
thy silver and thy gold be mine ; thy wife also and thy child , even the goodliest , be mine .
and the king of israel answer and say , my lord , o king , accord to thy say , i be thine , and all that i have .
and the messenger come again , and say , thus speaketh benhadad , say , although i have send unto thee , say , thou shalt deliver i thy silver , and thy gold , and thy wife , and thy child ;
yet i will send my servant unto thee to morrow about this time , and they shall search thine house , and the house of thy servant ; and it shall be , that whatsoever be pleasant in thine eye , they shall put it in they hand , and take it away .
then the king of israel call all the elder of the land , and say , mark , i pray you , and see how this man seeketh mischief : for he send unto i for my wife , and for my child , and for my silver , and for my gold ; and i deny he not .
and all the elder and all the people say unto he , hearken not unto he , nor consent .
wherefore he say unto the messenger of benhadad , tell my lord the king , all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do : but this thing i may not do .
and the messenger depart , and bring he word again .
and benhadad send unto he , and say , the god do so unto i , and more also , if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handful for all the people that follow i .
and the king of israel answer and say , tell he , let not he that girdeth on he harness boast himself as he that putteth it off .
and it come to pass , when ben-hadad hear this message , as he be drink , he and the king in the pavilion , that he say unto he servant , set yourselve in array .
and they set themselves in array against the city .
and , behold , there come a prophet unto ahab king of israel , say , thus saith the lord , hast thou see all this great multitude ? behold , i will deliver it into thine hand this day ; and thou shalt know that i be the lord .
and ahab say , by whom ?
and he say , thus saith the lord , even by the young man of the prince of the province .
then he say , who shall order the battle ?
and he answer , thou .
then he number the young man of the prince of the province , and they be two hundred and thirty two : and after they he number all the people , even all the child of israel , be seven thousand .
and they go out at noon .
but benhadad be drink himself drunk in the pavilion , he and the king , the thirty and two king that help he .
and the young man of the prince of the province go out first ; and benhadad send out , and they tell he , say , there be man come out of samaria .
and he say , whether they be come out for peace , take they alive ; or whether they be come out for war , take they alive .
so these young man of the prince of the province come out of the city , and the army which follow they .
and they slew every one he man : and the syrians flee ; and israel pursue they : and benhadad the king of syria escape on a horse with the horseman .
and the king of israel go out , and smite the horse and chariot , and slew the syrians with a great slaughter .
and the prophet come to the king of israel , and say unto he , go , strengthen thyself , and mark , and see what thou doest : for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee .
and the servant of the king of syria say unto he , they god be god of the hill ; therefore they be stronger than we ; but let we fight against they in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they .
and do this thing , take the king away , every man out of he place , and put captain in they room :
and number thee a army , like the army that thou hast lose , horse for horse , and chariot for chariot : and we will fight against they in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they .
and he hearken unto they voice , and do so .
and it come to pass at the return of the year , that benhadad number the syrians , and go up to aphek , to fight against israel .
and the child of israel be number , and be all present , and go against they : and the child of israel pitch before they like two little flock of kid ; but the syrians fill the country .
and there come a man of god , and spake unto the king of israel , and say , thus saith the lord , because the syrians have say , the lord be god of the hill , but he be not god of the valley , therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand , and ye shall know that i be the lord .
and they pitch one over against the other seven day .
and so it be , that in the seventh day the battle be join : and the child of israel slew of the syrians a hundred thousand footman in one day .
but the rest flee to aphek , into the city ; and there a wall fall upon twenty and seven thousand of the man that be leave .
and benhadad flee , and come into the city , into a inner chamber .
and he servant say unto he , behold now , we have hear that the king of the house of israel be merciful king : let we , i pray thee , put sackcloth on we loin , and rope upon we head , and go out to the king of israel : peradventure he will save thy life .
so they gird sackcloth on they loin , and put rope on they head , and come to the king of israel , and say , thy servant benhadad saith , i pray thee , let i live .
and he say , be he yet alive ? he be my brother .
now the man do diligently observe whether any thing would come from he , and do hastily catch it : and they say , thy brother benhadad .
then he say , go ye , bring he .
then benhadad come forth to he ; and he cause he to come up into the chariot .
and ben-hadad say unto he , the city , which my father take from thy father , i will restore ; and thou shalt make street for thee in damascus , as my father make in samaria .
then say ahab , i will send thee away with this covenant .
so he make a covenant with he , and send he away .
and a certain man of the son of the prophet say unto he neighbour in the word of the lord , smite i , i pray thee .
and the man refuse to smite he .
then say he unto he , because thou hast not obey the voice of the lord , behold , as soon as thou art depart from i , a lion shall slay thee .
and as soon as he be depart from he , a lion find he , and slew he .
then he find another man , and say , smite i , i pray thee .
and the man smite he , so that in smite he wound he .
so the prophet depart , and wait for the king by the way , and disguise himself with ash upon he face .
and as the king pass by , he cry unto the king : and he say , thy servant go out into the midst of the battle ; and , behold , a man turn aside , and bring a man unto i , and say , keep this man : if by any means he be miss , then shall thy life be for he life , or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver .
and as thy servant be busy here and there , he be go .
and the king of israel say unto he , so shall thy judgment be ; thyself hast decide it .
and he hast , and take the ash away from he face ; and the king of israel discern he that he be of the prophet .
and he say unto he , thus saith the lord , because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom i appoint to utter destruction , therefore thy life shall go for he life , and thy people for he people .
and the king of israel go to he house heavy and displeased , and come to samaria .
and it come to pass after these thing , that naboth the jezreelite have a vineyard , which be in jezreel , hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria .
and ahab spake unto naboth , say , give i thy vineyard , that i may have it for a garden of herb , because it be near unto my house : and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it ; or , if it seem good to thee , i will give thee the worth of it in money .
and naboth say to ahab , the lord forbid it i , that i should give the inheritance of my father unto thee .
and ahab come into he house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite have speak to he : for he have say , i will not give thee the inheritance of my father .
and he lay he down upon he bed , and turn away he face , and would eat no bread .
but jezebel he wife come to he , and say unto he , why be thy spirit so sad , that thou eatest no bread ?
and he say unto she , because i speak unto naboth the jezreelite , and say unto he , give i thy vineyard for money ; or else , if it please thee , i will give thee another vineyard for it : and he answer , i will not give thee my vineyard .
and jezebel he wife say unto he , dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel ? arise , and eat bread , and let thine heart be merry : i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite .
so she write letter in ahab 's name , and seal they with he seal , and send the letter unto the elder and to the noble that be in he city , dwelling with naboth .
and she write in the letter , say , proclaim a fast , and set naboth on high among the people :
and set two man , son of belial , before he , to bear witness against he , say , thou do blaspheme god and the king .
and then carry he out , and stone he , that he may die .
and the man of he city , even the elder and the noble who be the inhabitant in he city , do as jezebel have send unto they , and as it be write in the letter which she have send unto they .
they proclaim a fast , and set naboth on high among the people .
and there come in two man , child of belial , and sit before he : and the man of belial witness against he , even against naboth , in the presence of the people , say , naboth do blaspheme god and the king .
then they carry he forth out of the city , and stone he with stone , that he die .
then they send to jezebel , say , naboth be stone , and be dead .
and it come to pass , when jezebel hear that naboth be stone , and be dead , that jezebel say to ahab , arise , take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite , which he refuse to give thee for money : for naboth be not alive , but dead .
and it come to pass , when ahab hear that naboth be dead , that ahab rise up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite , to take possession of it .
and the word of the lord come to elijah the tishbite , say ,
arise , go down to meet ahab king of israel , which be in samaria : behold , he be in the vineyard of naboth , whither he be go down to possess it .
and thou shalt speak unto he , say , thus saith the lord , hast thou kill , and also take possession ?
and thou shalt speak unto he , say , thus saith the lord , in the place where dog lick the blood of naboth shall dog lick thy blood , even thine .
and ahab say to elijah , hast thou find i , o mine enemy ?
and he answer , i have find thee : because thou hast sell thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord .
behold , i will bring evil upon thee , and will take away thy posterity , and will cut off from ahab he that pisseth against the wall , and he that be shut up and leave in israel ,
and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat , and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoke i to anger , and make israel to sin .
and of jezebel also speak the lord , say , the dog shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel .
he that dieth of ahab in the city the dog shall eat ; and he that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the air eat .
but there be none like unto ahab , which do sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord , whom jezebel he wife stir up .
and he do very abominably in follow idol , accord to all thing as do the amorites , whom the lord cast out before the child of israel .
and it come to pass , when ahab hear those word , that he rent he clothes , and put sackcloth upon he flesh , and fast , and lay in sackcloth , and go softly .
and the word of the lord come to elijah the tishbite , say ,
seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before i ? because he humbleth himself before i , i will not bring the evil in he day : but in he son 's day will i bring the evil upon he house .
and they continue three year without war between syria and israel .
and it come to pass in the third year , that jehoshaphat the king of judah come down to the king of israel .
and the king of israel say unto he servant , know ye that ramoth in gilead be ours , and we be still , and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria ?
and he say unto jehoshaphat , wilt thou go with i to battle to ramothgilead ?
and jehoshaphat say to the king of israel , i be as thou art , my people as thy people , my horse as thy horse .
and jehoshaphat say unto the king of israel , enquire , i pray thee , at the word of the lord to day .
then the king of israel gather the prophet together , about four hundred man , and say unto they , shall i go against ramothgilead to battle , or shall i forbear ?
and they say , go up ; for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
and jehoshaphat say , be there not here a prophet of the lord besides , that we might enquire of he ?
and the king of israel say unto jehoshaphat , there be yet one man , micaiah the son of imlah , by whom we may enquire of the lord : but i hate he ; for he doth not prophesy good concern i , but evil .
and jehoshaphat say , let not the king say so .
then the king of israel call a officer , and say , hasten hither micaiah the son of imlah .
and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sit each on he throne , have put on they robe , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of samaria ; and all the prophet prophesy before they .
and zedekiah the son of chenaanah make he horn of iron : and he say , thus saith the lord , with these shalt thou push the syrians , until thou have consume they .
and all the prophet prophesy so , say , go up to ramothgilead , and prosper : for the lord shall deliver it into the king 's hand .
and the messenger that be go to call micaiah spake unto he , say , behold now , the word of the prophet declare good unto the king with one mouth : let thy word , i pray thee , be like the word of one of they , and speak that which be good .
and micaiah say , as the lord liveth , what the lord saith unto i , that will i speak .
so he come to the king .
and the king say unto he , micaiah , shall we go against ramothgilead to battle , or shall we forbear ?
and he answer he , go , and prosper : for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
and the king say unto he , how many time shall i adjure thee that thou tell i nothing but that which be true in the name of the lord ?
and he say , i see all israel scatter upon the hill , as sheep that have not a shepherd : and the lord say , these have no master : let they return every man to he house in peace .
and the king of israel say unto jehoshaphat , do i not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concern i , but evil ?
and he say , hear thou therefore the word of the lord : i see the lord sit on he throne , and all the host of heaven standing by he on he right hand and on he left .
and the lord say , who shall persuade ahab , that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead ?
and one say on this manner , and another say on that manner .
and there come forth a spirit , and stand before the lord , and say , i will persuade he .
and the lord say unto he , wherewith ?
and he say , i will go forth , and i will be a lie spirit in the mouth of all he prophet .
and he say , thou shalt persuade he , and prevail also : go forth , and do so .
now therefore , behold , the lord have put a lie spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophet , and the lord have speak evil concern thee .
but zedekiah the son of chenaanah go near , and smite micaiah on the cheek , and say , which way go the spirit of the lord from i to speak unto thee ?
and micaiah say , behold , thou shalt see in that day , when thou shalt go into a inner chamber to hide thyself .
and the king of israel say , take micaiah , and carry he back unto amon the governor of the city , and to joash the king 's son ;
and say , thus saith the king , put this fellow in the prison , and feed he with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until i come in peace .
and micaiah say , if thou return at all in peace , the lord have not speak by i .
and he say , hearken , o people , every one of you .
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah go up to ramothgilead .
and the king of israel say unto jehoshaphat , i will disguise myself , and enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robe .
and the king of israel disguise himself , and go into the battle .
but the king of syria command he thirty and two captain that have rule over he chariot , say , fight neither with small nor great , save only with the king of israel .
and it come to pass , when the captain of the chariot see jehoshaphat , that they say , surely it be the king of israel .
and they turn aside to fight against he : and jehoshaphat cry out .
and it come to pass , when the captain of the chariot perceive that it be not the king of israel , that they turn back from pursue he .
and a certain man draw a bow at a venture , and smite the king of israel between the joint of the harness : wherefore he say unto the driver of he chariot , turn thine hand , and carry i out of the host ; for i be wound .
and the battle increase that day : and the king be stay up in he chariot against the syrians , and die at even : and the blood run out of the wound into the midst of the chariot .
and there go a proclamation throughout the host about the go down of the sun , say , every man to he city , and every man to he own country .
so the king die , and be bring to samaria ; and they bury the king in samaria .
and one wash the chariot in the pool of samaria ; and the dog lick up he blood ; and they wash he armour ; accord unto the word of the lord which he speak .
now the rest of the act of ahab , and all that he do , and the ivory house which he make , and all the city that he build , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of israel ?
so ahab sleep with he father ; and ahaziah he son reign in he stead .
and jehoshaphat the son of asa begin to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel .
jehoshaphat be thirty and five year old when he begin to reign ; and he reign twenty and five year in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be azubah the daughter of shilhi .
and he walk in all the way of asa he father ; he turn not aside from it , do that which be right in the eye of the lord : nevertheless the high place be not take away ; for the people offer and burnt incense yet in the high place .
and jehoshaphat make peace with the king of israel .
now the rest of the act of jehoshaphat , and he might that he shew , and how he war , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
and the remnant of the sodomite , which remain in the day of he father asa , he take out of the land .
there be then no king in edom : a deputy be king .
jehoshaphat make ship of tharshish to go to ophir for gold : but they go not ; for the ship be break at eziongeber .
then say ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat , let my servant go with thy servant in the ship .
but jehoshaphat would not .
and jehoshaphat sleep with he father , and be bury with he father in the city of david he father : and jehoram he son reign in he stead .
ahaziah the son of ahab begin to reign over israel in samaria the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah , and reign two year over israel .
and he do evil in the sight of the lord , and walk in the way of he father , and in the way of he mother , and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat , who make israel to sin :
for he serve baal , and worship he , and provoke to anger the lord god of israel , accord to all that he father have do .
then moab rebel against israel after the death of ahab .
and ahaziah fall down through a lattice in he upper chamber that be in samaria , and be sick : and he send messenger , and say unto they , go , enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shall recover of this disease .
but the angel of the lord say to elijah the tishbite , arise , go up to meet the messenger of the king of samaria , and say unto they , be it not because there be not a god in israel , that ye go to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron ?
now therefore thus saith the lord , thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art go up , but shalt surely die .
and elijah depart .
and when the messenger turn back unto he , he say unto they , why be ye now turn back ?
and they say unto he , there come a man up to meet we , and say unto we , go , turn again unto the king that send you , and say unto he , thus saith the lord , be it not because there be not a god in israel , that thou sendest to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron ? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art go up , but shalt surely die .
and he say unto they , what manner of man be he which come up to meet you , and tell you these word ?
and they answer he , he be a hairy man , and girt with a girdle of leather about he loin .
and he say , it be elijah the tishbite .
then the king send unto he a captain of fifty with he fifty .
and he go up to he : and , behold , he sit on the top of a hill .
and he speak unto he , thou man of god , the king have say , come down .
and elijah answer and say to the captain of fifty , if i be a man of god , then let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty .
and there come down fire from heaven , and consume he and he fifty .
again also he send unto he another captain of fifty with he fifty .
and he answer and say unto he , o man of god , thus have the king say , come down quickly .
and elijah answer and say unto they , if i be a man of god , let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty .
and the fire of god come down from heaven , and consume he and he fifty .
and he send again a captain of the third fifty with he fifty .
and the third captain of fifty go up , and come and fall on he knee before elijah , and besought he , and say unto he , o man of god , i pray thee , let my life , and the life of these fifty thy servant , be precious in thy sight .
behold , there come fire down from heaven , and burn up the two captain of the former fifty with they fifty : therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight .
and the angel of the lord say unto elijah , go down with he : be not afraid of he .
and he arise , and go down with he unto the king .
and he say unto he , thus saith the lord , forasmuch as thou hast send messenger to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron , be it not because there be no god in israel to enquire of he word ? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art go up , but shalt surely die .
so he die accord to the word of the lord which elijah have speak .
and jehoram reign in he stead in the second year of jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah ; because he have no son .
now the rest of the act of ahaziah which he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of israel ?
and it come to pass , when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind , that elijah go with elisha from gilgal .
and elijah say unto elisha , tarry here , i pray thee ; for the lord have send i to bethel .
and elisha say unto he , as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , i will not leave thee .
so they go down to bethel .
and the son of the prophet that be at bethel come forth to elisha , and say unto he , knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day ?
and he say , yea , i know it ; hold ye you peace .
and elijah say unto he , elisha , tarry here , i pray thee ; for the lord have send i to jericho .
and he say , as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , i will not leave thee .
so they come to jericho .
and the son of the prophet that be at jericho come to elisha , and say unto he , knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day ?
and he answer , yea , i know it ; hold ye you peace .
and elijah say unto he , tarry , i pray thee , here ; for the lord have send i to jordan .
and he say , as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , i will not leave thee .
and they two go on .
and fifty man of the son of the prophet go , and stand to view afar off : and they two stand by jordan .
and elijah take he mantle , and wrap it together , and smite the water , and they be divide hither and thither , so that they two go over on dry ground .
and it come to pass , when they be go over , that elijah say unto elisha , ask what i shall do for thee , before i be take away from thee .
and elisha say , i pray thee , let a double portion of thy spirit be upon i .
and he say , thou hast ask a hard thing : nevertheless , if thou see i when i be take from thee , it shall be so unto thee ; but if not , it shall not be so .
and it come to pass , as they still go on , and talk , that , behold , there appear a chariot of fire , and horse of fire , and part they both asunder ; and elijah go up by a whirlwind into heaven .
and elisha see it , and he cry , my father , my father , the chariot of israel , and the horseman thereof .
and he see he no more : and he take hold of he own clothes , and rent they in two piece .
he take up also the mantle of elijah that fall from he , and go back , and stand by the bank of jordan ;
and he take the mantle of elijah that fall from he , and smite the water , and say , where be the lord god of elijah ? and when he also have smite the water , they part hither and thither : and elisha go over .
and when the son of the prophet which be to view at jericho see he , they say , the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha .
and they come to meet he , and bow themselves to the ground before he .
and they say unto he , behold now , there be with thy servant fifty strong man ; let they go , we pray thee , and seek thy master : lest peradventure the spirit of the lord have take he up , and cast he upon some mountain , or into some valley .
and he say , ye shall not send .
and when they urge he till he be ashamed , he say , send .
they send therefore fifty man ; and they seek three day , but find he not .
and when they come again to he , ( for he tarry at jericho , ) he say unto they , do i not say unto you , go not ?
and the man of the city say unto elisha , behold , i pray thee , the situation of this city be pleasant , as my lord seeth : but the water be naught , and the ground barren .
and he say , bring i a new cruse , and put salt therein .
and they bring it to he .
and he go forth unto the spring of the water , and cast the salt in there , and say , thus saith the lord , i have heal these water ; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land .
so the water be heal unto this day , accord to the say of elisha which he speak .
and he go up from thence unto bethel : and as he be go up by the way , there come forth little child out of the city , and mock he , and say unto he , go up , thou bald head ; go up , thou bald head .
and he turn back , and look on they , and curse they in the name of the lord .
and there come forth two she bear out of the wood , and tare forty and two child of they .
and he go from thence to mount carmel , and from thence he return to samaria .
now jehoram the son of ahab begin to reign over israel in samaria the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah , and reign twelve year .
and he work evil in the sight of the lord ; but not like he father , and like he mother : for he put away the image of baal that he father have make .
nevertheless he cleave unto the sin of jeroboam the son of nebat , which make israel to sin ; he depart not therefrom .
and mesha king of moab be a sheepmaster , and render unto the king of israel a hundred thousand lamb , and a hundred thousand ram , with the wool .
but it come to pass , when ahab be dead , that the king of moab rebel against the king of israel .
and king jehoram go out of samaria the same time , and number all israel .
and he go and send to jehoshaphat the king of judah , say , the king of moab have rebel against i : wilt thou go with i against moab to battle ?
and he say , i will go up : i be as thou art , my people as thy people , and my horse as thy horse .
and he say , which way shall we go up ?
and he answer , the way through the wilderness of edom .
so the king of israel go , and the king of judah , and the king of edom : and they fetch a compass of seven day ' journey : and there be no water for the host , and for the cattle that follow they .
and the king of israel say , alas ! that the lord have call these three king together , to deliver they into the hand of moab !
but jehoshaphat say , be there not here a prophet of the lord , that we may enquire of the lord by he ?
and one of the king of israel 's servant answer and say , here be elisha the son of shaphat , which pour water on the hand of elijah .
and jehoshaphat say , the word of the lord be with he .
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom go down to he .
and elisha say unto the king of israel , what have i to do with thee ? get thee to the prophet of thy father , and to the prophet of thy mother .
and the king of israel say unto he , nay : for the lord have call these three king together , to deliver they into the hand of moab .
and elisha say , as the lord of host liveth , before whom i stand , surely , be it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah , i would not look toward thee , nor see thee .
but now bring i a minstrel .
and it come to pass , when the minstrel play , that the hand of the lord come upon he .
and he say , thus saith the lord , make this valley full of ditch .
for thus saith the lord , ye shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that valley shall be fill with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and you cattle , and you beast .
and this be but a light thing in the sight of the lord : he will deliver the moabites also into you hand .
and ye shall smite every fenced city , and every choice city , and shall fall every good tree , and stop all well of water , and mar every good piece of land with stone .
and it come to pass in the morning , when the meat offering be offer , that , behold , there come water by the way of edom , and the country be fill with water .
and when all the moabites hear that the king be come up to fight against they , they gather all that be able to put on armour , and upward , and stand in the border .
and they rise up early in the morning , and the sun shone upon the water , and the moabites see the water on the other side as red as blood :
and they say , this be blood : the king be surely slay , and they have smite one another : now therefore , moab , to the spoil .
and when they come to the camp of israel , the israelites rise up and smite the moabites , so that they flee before they : but they go forward smite the moabites , even in they country .
and they beat down the city , and on every good piece of land cast every man he stone , and fill it ; and they stop all the well of water , and fell all the good tree : only in kirharaseth leave they the stone thereof ; howbeit the slinger go about it , and smite it .
and when the king of moab see that the battle be too sore for he , he take with he seven hundred man that draw sword , to break through even unto the king of edom : but they could not .
then he take he eldest son that should have reign in he stead , and offer he for a burnt offering upon the wall .
and there be great indignation against israel : and they depart from he , and return to they own land .
now there cry a certain woman of the wife of the son of the prophet unto elisha , say , thy servant my husband be dead ; and thou knowest that thy servant do fear the lord : and the creditor be come to take unto he my two son to be bondmen .
and elisha say unto she , what shall i do for thee ? tell i , what hast thou in the house ?
and she say , thine handmaid have not any thing in the house , save a pot of oil .
then he say , go , borrow thee vessel abroad of all thy neighbour , even empty vessel ; borrow not a few .
and when thou art come in , thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy son , and shalt pour out into all those vessel , and thou shalt set aside that which be full .
so she go from he , and shut the door upon she and upon she son , who bring the vessel to she ; and she pour out .
and it come to pass , when the vessel be full , that she say unto she son , bring i yet a vessel .
and he say unto she , there be not a vessel more .
and the oil stay .
then she come and tell the man of god .
and he say , go , sell the oil , and pay thy debt , and live thou and thy child of the rest .
and it fall on a day , that elisha pass to shunem , where be a great woman ; and she constrain he to eat bread .
and so it be , that as oft as he pass by , he turn in thither to eat bread .
and she say unto she husband , behold now , i perceive that this be a holy man of god , which passeth by we continually .
let we make a little chamber , i pray thee , on the wall ; and let we set for he there a bed , and a table , and a stool , and a candlestick : and it shall be , when he cometh to we , that he shall turn in thither .
and it fall on a day , that he come thither , and he turn into the chamber , and lay there .
and he say to gehazi he servant , call this shunammite .
and when he have call she , she stand before he .
and he say unto he , say now unto she , behold , thou hast be careful for we with all this care ; what be to be do for thee ? wouldest thou be speak for to the king , or to the captain of the host ?
and she answer , i dwell among mine own people .
and he say , what then be to be do for she ?
and gehazus answer , verily she have no child , and she husband be old .
and he say , call she .
and when he have call she , she stand in the door .
and he say , about this season , accord to the time of life , thou shalt embrace a son .
and she say , nay , my lord , thou man of god , do not lie unto thine handmaid .
and the woman conceive , and bare a son at that season that elisha have say unto she , accord to the time of life .
and when the child be grow , it fall on a day , that he go out to he father to the reaper .
and he say unto he father , my head , my head .
and he say to a lad , carry he to he mother .
and when he have take he , and bring he to he mother , he sit on she knee till noon , and then die .
and she go up , and lay he on the bed of the man of god , and shut the door upon he , and go out .
and she call unto she husband , and say , send i , i pray thee , one of the young man , and one of the ass , that i may run to the man of god , and come again .
and he say , wherefore wilt thou go to he to day ? it be neither new moon , nor sabbath .
and she say , it shall be well .
then she saddle a ass , and say to she servant , drive , and go forward ; slack not thy ride for i , except i bid thee .
so she go and come unto the man of god to mount carmel .
and it come to pass , when the man of god see she afar off , that he say to gehazi he servant , behold , yonder be that shunammite :
run now , i pray thee , to meet she , and say unto she , be it well with thee ? be it well with thy husband ? be it well with the child ?
and she answer , it be well .
and when she come to the man of god to the hill , she catch he by the foot : but gehazi come near to thrust she away .
and the man of god say , let she alone ; for she soul be vex within she : and the lord have hide it from i , and have not tell i .
then she say , do i desire a son of my lord ? do i not say , do not deceive i ?
then he say to gehazi , gird up thy loin , and take my staff in thine hand , and go thy way : if thou meet any man , salute he not ; and if any salute thee , answer he not again : and lay my staff upon the face of the child .
and the mother of the child say , as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , i will not leave thee .
and he arise , and follow she .
and gehazi pass on before they , and lay the staff upon the face of the child ; but there be neither voice , nor hearing .
wherefore he go again to meet he , and tell he , say , the child be not awake .
and when elisha be come into the house , behold , the child be dead , and lay upon he bed .
he go in therefore , and shut the door upon they twain , and pray unto the lord .
and he go up , and lay upon the child , and put he mouth upon he mouth , and he eye upon he eye , and he hand upon he hand : and he stretch himself upon the child ; and the flesh of the child wax warm .
then he return , and walk in the house to and fro ; and go up , and stretch himself upon he : and the child sneeze seven time , and the child open he eye .
and he call gehazi , and say , call this shunammite .
so he call she .
and when she be come in unto he , he say , take up thy son .
then she go in , and fall at he foot , and bow herself to the ground , and take up she son , and go out .
and elisha come again to gilgal : and there be a dearth in the land ; and the son of the prophet be sit before he : and he say unto he servant , set on the great pot , and seethe pottage for the son of the prophet .
and one go out into the field to gather herb , and find a wild vine , and gather thereof wild gourd he lap full , and come and shred they into the pot of pottage : for they know they not .
so they pour out for the man to eat .
and it come to pass , as they be eat of the pottage , that they cry out , and say , o thou man of god , there be death in the pot .
and they could not eat thereof .
but he say , then bring meal .
and he cast it into the pot ; and he say , pour out for the people , that they may eat .
and there be no harm in the pot .
and there come a man from baalshalisha , and bring the man of god bread of the firstfruit , twenty loaf of barley , and full ear of corn in the husk thereof .
and he say , give unto the people , that they may eat .
and he servitor say , what , should i set this before a hundred man ?
he say again , give the people , that they may eat : for thus saith the lord , they shall eat , and shall leave thereof .
so he set it before they , and they do eat , and leave thereof , accord to the word of the lord .
now naaman , captain of the host of the king of syria , be a great man with he master , and honourable , because by he the lord have give deliverance unto syria : he be also a mighty man in valour , but he be a leper .
and the syrians have go out by company , and have bring away captive out of the land of israel a little maid ; and she wait on naaman 's wife .
and she say unto she mistress , would god my lord be with the prophet that be in samaria ! for he would recover he of he leprosy .
and one go in , and tell he lord , say , thus and thus say the maid that be of the land of israel .
and the king of syria say , go to , go , and i will send a letter unto the king of israel .
and he depart , and take with he ten talent of silver , and six thousand piece of gold , and ten change of raiment .
and he bring the letter to the king of israel , say , now when this letter be come unto thee , behold , i have therewith send naaman my servant to thee , that thou mayest recover he of he leprosy .
and it come to pass , when the king of israel have read the letter , that he rent he clothes , and say , be i god , to kill and to make alive , that this man doth send unto i to recover a man of he leprosy ? wherefore consider , i pray you , and see how he seeketh a quarrel against i .
and it be so , when elisha the man of god have hear that the king of israel have rent he clothes , that he send to the king , say , wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes ? let he come now to i , and he shall know that there be a prophet in israel .
so naaman come with he horse and with he chariot , and stand at the door of the house of elisha .
and elisha send a messenger unto he , say , go and wash in jordan seven time , and thy flesh shall come again to thee , and thou shalt be clean .
but naaman be wroth , and go away , and say , behold , i think , he will surely come out to i , and stand , and call on the name of the lord he god , and strike he hand over the place , and recover the leper .
be not abana and pharpar , river of damascus , better than all the water of israel ? may i not wash in they , and be clean ?
so he turn and go away in a rage .
and he servant come near , and spake unto he , and say , my father , if the prophet have bid thee do some great thing , wouldest thou not have do it ? how much rather then , when he saith to thee , wash , and be clean ?
then go he down , and dip himself seven time in jordan , accord to the say of the man of god : and he flesh come again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he be clean .
and he return to the man of god , he and all he company , and come , and stand before he : and he say , behold , now i know that there be no god in all the earth , but in israel : now therefore , i pray thee , take a blessing of thy servant .
but he say , as the lord liveth , before whom i stand , i will receive none .
and he urge he to take it ; but he refuse .
and naaman say , shall there not then , i pray thee , be give to thy servant two mule ' burden of earth ? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other god , but unto the lord .
in this thing the lord pardon thy servant , that when my master goeth into the house of rimmon to worship there , and he leaneth on my hand , and i bow myself in the house of rimmon : when i bow down myself in the house of rimmon , the lord pardon thy servant in this thing .
and he say unto he , go in peace .
so he depart from he a little way .
but gehazi , the servant of elisha the man of god , say , behold , my master have spare naaman this syrian , in not receive at he hand that which he bring : but , as the lord liveth , i will run after he , and take somewhat of he .
so gehazi follow after naaman .
and when naaman see he run after he , he light down from the chariot to meet he , and say , be all well ?
and he say , all be well .
my master have send i , say , behold , even now there be come to i from mount ephraim two young man of the son of the prophet : give they , i pray thee , a talent of silver , and two change of garment .
and naaman say , be content , take two talent .
and he urge he , and bind two talent of silver in two bag , with two change of garment , and lay they upon two of he servant ; and they bare they before he .
and when he come to the tower , he take they from they hand , and bestow they in the house : and he let the man go , and they depart .
but he go in , and stand before he master .
and elisha say unto he , whence comest thou , gehazi ?
and he say , thy servant go no whither .
and he say unto he , go not mine heart with thee , when the man turn again from he chariot to meet thee ?
be it a time to receive money , and to receive garment , and oliveyard , and vineyard , and sheep , and ox , and manservant , and maidservant ?
the leprosy therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee , and unto thy seed for ever .
and he go out from he presence a leper as white as snow .
and the son of the prophet say unto elisha , behold now , the place where we dwell with thee be too strait for we .
let we go , we pray thee , unto jordan , and take thence every man a beam , and let we make we a place there , where we may dwell .
and he answer , go ye .
and one say , be content , i pray thee , and go with thy servant .
and he answer , i will go .
so he go with they .
and when they come to jordan , they cut down wood .
but as one be fell a beam , the axe head fall into the water : and he cry , and say , alas , master ! for it be borrow .
and the man of god say , where fall it ?
and he shew he the place .
and he cut down a stick , and cast it in thither ; and the iron do swim .
therefore say he , take it up to thee .
and he put out he hand , and take it .
then the king of syria war against israel , and take counsel with he servant , say , in such and such a place shall be my camp .
and the man of god send unto the king of israel , say , beware that thou pass not such a place ; for thither the syrians be come down .
and the king of israel send to the place which the man of god tell he and warn he of , and save himself there , not once nor twice .
therefore the heart of the king of syria be sore trouble for this thing ; and he call he servant , and say unto they , will ye not shew i which of we be for the king of israel ?
and one of he servant say , none , my lord , o king : but elisha , the prophet that be in israel , telleth the king of israel the word that thou speakest in thy bedchamber .
and he say , go and spy where he be , that i may send and fetch he .
and it be tell he , say , behold , he be in dothan .
therefore send he thither horse , and chariot , and a great host : and they come by night , and compass the city about .
and when the servant of the man of god be rise early , and go forth , behold , a host compass the city both with horse and chariot .
and he servant say unto he , alas , my master ! how shall we do ?
and he answer , fear not : for they that be with we be more than they that be with they .
and elisha pray , and say , lord , i pray thee , open he eye , that he may see .
and the lord open the eye of the young man ; and he see : and , behold , the mountain be full of horse and chariot of fire round about elisha .
and when they come down to he , elisha pray unto the lord , and say , smite this people , i pray thee , with blindness .
and he smite they with blindness accord to the word of elisha .
and elisha say unto they , this be not the way , neither be this the city : follow i , and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek .
but he lead they to samaria .
and it come to pass , when they be come into samaria , that elisha say , lord , open the eye of these man , that they may see .
and the lord open they eye , and they see ; and , behold , they be in the midst of samaria .
and the king of israel say unto elisha , when he see they , my father , shall i smite they ? shall i smite they ?
and he answer , thou shalt not smite they : wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast take captive with thy sword and with thy bow ? set bread and water before they , that they may eat and drink , and go to they master .
and he prepare great provision for they : and when they have eat and drunk , he send they away , and they go to they master .
so the band of syria come no more into the land of israel .
and it come to pass after this , that benhadad king of syria gather all he host , and go up , and besiege samaria .
and there be a great famine in samaria : and , behold , they besiege it , until a ass 's head be sell for fourscore piece of silver , and the fourth part of a cab of dive 's dung for five piece of silver .
and as the king of israel be pass by upon the wall , there cry a woman unto he , say , help , my lord , o king .
and he say , if the lord do not help thee , whence shall i help thee ? out of the barnfloor , or out of the winepress ?
and the king say unto she , what aileth thee ?
and she answer , this woman say unto i , give thy son , that we may eat he to day , and we will eat my son to morrow .
so we boil my son , and do eat he : and i say unto she on the next day , give thy son , that we may eat he : and she have hide she son .
and it come to pass , when the king hear the word of the woman , that he rent he clothes ; and he pass by upon the wall , and the people look , and , behold , he have sackcloth within upon he flesh .
then he say , god do so and more also to i , if the head of elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on he this day .
but elisha sit in he house , and the elder sit with he ; and the king send a man from before he : but ere the messenger come to he , he say to the elder , see ye how this son of a murderer have send to take away mine head ? look , when the messenger cometh , shut the door , and hold he fast at the door : be not the sound of he master 's foot behind he ?
and while he yet talk with they , behold , the messenger come down unto he : and he say , behold , this evil be of the lord ; what should i wait for the lord any longer ?
then elisha say , hear ye the word of the lord ; thus saith the lord , to morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sell for a shekel , and two measure of barley for a shekel , in the gate of samaria .
then a lord on whose hand the king lean answer the man of god , and say , behold , if the lord would make window in heaven , might this thing be ?
and he say , behold , thou shalt see it with thine eye , but shalt not eat thereof .
and there be four leprous man at the enter in of the gate : and they say one to another , why sit we here until we die ?
if we say , we will enter into the city , then the famine be in the city , and we shall die there : and if we sit still here , we die also .
now therefore come , and let we fall unto the host of the syrians : if they save we alive , we shall live ; and if they kill we , we shall but die .
and they rise up in the twilight , to go unto the camp of the syrians : and when they be come to the uttermost part of the camp of syria , behold , there be no man there .
for the lord have make the host of the syrians to hear a noise of chariot , and a noise of horse , even the noise of a great host : and they say one to another , lo , the king of israel have hire against we the king of the hittites , and the king of the egyptians , to come upon we .
wherefore they arise and flee in the twilight , and leave they tent , and they horse , and they ass , even the camp as it be , and flee for they life .
and when these leper come to the uttermost part of the camp , they go into one tent , and do eat and drink , and carry thence silver , and gold , and raiment , and go and hide it ; and come again , and enter into another tent , and carry thence also , and go and hide it .
then they say one to another , we do not well : this day be a day of good tiding , and we hold we peace : if we tarry till the morning light , some mischief will come upon we : now therefore come , that we may go and tell the king 's household .
so they come and call unto the porter of the city : and they tell they , say , we come to the camp of the syrians , and , behold , there be no man there , neither voice of man , but horse tie , and ass tie , and the tent as they be .
and he call the porter ; and they tell it to the king 's house within .
and the king arise in the night , and say unto he servant , i will now shew you what the syrians have do to we .
they know that we be hungry ; therefore be they go out of the camp to hide themselves in the field , say , when they come out of the city , we shall catch they alive , and get into the city .
and one of he servant answer and say , let some take , i pray thee , five of the horse that remain , which be leave in the city , ( behold , they be as all the multitude of israel that be leave in it : behold , i say , they be even as all the multitude of the israelites that be consume : ) and let we send and see .
they take therefore two chariot horse ; and the king send after the host of the syrians , say , go and see .
and they go after they unto jordan : and , lo , all the way be full of garment and vessel , which the syrians have cast away in they haste .
and the messenger return , and tell the king .
and the people go out , and spoil the tent of the syrians .
so a measure of fine flour be sell for a shekel , and two measure of barley for a shekel , accord to the word of the lord .
and the king appoint the lord on whose hand he lean to have the charge of the gate : and the people trode upon he in the gate , and he die , as the man of god have say , who speak when the king come down to he .
and it come to pass as the man of god have speak to the king , say , two measure of barley for a shekel , and a measure of fine flour for a shekel , shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of samaria :
and that lord answer the man of god , and say , now , behold , if the lord should make window in heaven , might such a thing be ?
and he say , behold , thou shalt see it with thine eye , but shalt not eat thereof .
and so it fall out unto he : for the people trode upon he in the gate , and he die .
then spake elisha unto the woman , whose son he have restore to life , say , arise , and go thou and thine household , and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn : for the lord have call for a famine ; and it shall also come upon the land seven year .
and the woman arise , and do after the say of the man of god : and she go with she household , and sojourn in the land of the philistines seven year .
and it come to pass at the seven year ' end , that the woman return out of the land of the philistines : and she go forth to cry unto the king for she house and for she land .
and the king talk with gehazi the servant of the man of god , say , tell i , i pray thee , all the great thing that elisha have do .
and it come to pass , as he be tell the king how he have restore a dead body to life , that , behold , the woman , whose son he have restore to life , cry to the king for she house and for she land .
and gehazi say , my lord , o king , this be the woman , and this be she son , whom elisha restore to life .
and when the king ask the woman , she tell he .
so the king appoint unto she a certain officer , say , restore all that be hers , and all the fruit of the field since the day that she leave the land , even until now .
and elisha come to damascus ; and benhadad the king of syria be sick ; and it be tell he , say , the man of god be come hither .
and the king say unto hazael , take a present in thine hand , and go , meet the man of god , and enquire of the lord by he , say , shall i recover of this disease ?
so hazael go to meet he , and take a present with he , even of every good thing of damascus , forty camel ' burden , and come and stand before he , and say , thy son benhadad king of syria have send i to thee , say , shall i recover of this disease ?
and elisha say unto he , go , say unto he , thou mayest certainly recover : howbeit the lord have shew i that he shall surely die .
and he settle he countenance stedfastly , until he be ashamed : and the man of god weep .
and hazael say , why weepeth my lord ?
and he answer , because i know the evil that thou wilt do unto the child of israel : they strong hold wilt thou set on fire , and they young man wilt thou slay with the sword , and wilt dash they child , and rip up they woman with child .
and hazael say , but what , be thy servant a dog , that he should do this great thing ?
and elisha answer , the lord have shew i that thou shalt be king over syria .
so he depart from elisha , and come to he master ; who say to he , what say elisha to thee ?
and he answer , he tell i that thou shouldest surely recover .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that he take a thick cloth , and dip it in water , and spread it on he face , so that he die : and hazael reign in he stead .
and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel , jehoshaphat be then king of judah , jehoram the son of je hoshaphat king of judah begin to reign .
thirty and two year old be he when he begin to reign ; and he reign eight year in jerusalem .
and he walk in the way of the king of israel , as do the house of ahab : for the daughter of ahab be he wife : and he do evil in the sight of the lord .
yet the lord would not destroy judah for david he servant 's sake , as he promise he to give he alway a light , and to he child .
in he day edom revolt from under the hand of judah , and make a king over themselves .
so joram go over to zair , and all the chariot with he : and he rise by night , and smite the edomites which compass he about , and the captain of the chariot : and the people flee into they tent .
yet edom revolt from under the hand of judah unto this day .
then libnah revolt at the same time .
and the rest of the act of joram , and all that he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
and joram sleep with he father , and be bury with he father in the city of david : and ahaziah he son reign in he stead .
in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel do ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign .
two and twenty year old be ahaziah when he begin to reign ; and he reign one year in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be athaliah , the daughter of omri king of israel .
and he walk in the way of the house of ahab , and do evil in the sight of the lord , as do the house of ahab : for he be the son in law of the house of ahab .
and he go with joram the son of ahab to the war against hazael king of syria in ramothgilead ; and the syrians wound joram .
and king joram go back to be heal in jezreel of the wound which the syrians have give he at ramah , when he fight against hazael king of syria .
and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah go down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel , because he be sick .
and elisha the prophet call one of the child of the prophet , and say unto he , gird up thy loin , and take this box of oil in thine hand , and go to ramothgilead :
and when thou comest thither , look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi , and go in , and make he arise up from among he brethren , and carry he to a inner chamber ;
then take the box of oil , and pour it on he head , and say , thus saith the lord , i have anoint thee king over israel .
then open the door , and flee , and tarry not .
so the young man , even the young man the prophet , go to ramothgilead .
and when he come , behold , the captain of the host be sit ; and he say , i have a errand to thee , o captain .
and jehu say , unto which of all we ?
and he say , to thee , o captain .
and he arise , and go into the house ; and he pour the oil on he head , and say unto he , thus saith the lord god of israel , i have anoint thee king over the people of the lord , even over israel .
and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master , that i may avenge the blood of my servant the prophet , and the blood of all the servant of the lord , at the hand of jezebel .
for the whole house of ahab shall perish : and i will cut off from ahab he that pisseth against the wall , and he that be shut up and leave in israel :
and i will make the house of ahab like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat , and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah :
and the dog shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel , and there shall be none to bury she .
and he open the door , and flee .
then jehu come forth to the servant of he lord : and one say unto he , be all well ? wherefore come this mad fellow to thee ?
and he say unto they , ye know the man , and he communication .
and they say , it be false ; tell we now .
and he say , thus and thus speak he to i , say , thus saith the lord , i have anoint thee king over israel .
then they hast , and take every man he garment , and put it under he on the top of the stair , and blow with trumpet , say , jehu be king .
so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspire against joram .
( now joram have keep ramothgilead , he and all israel , because of hazael king of syria .
but king joram be return to be heal in jezreel of the wound which the syrians have give he , when he fight with hazael king of syria . )
and jehu say , if it be you mind , then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel .
so jehu ride in a chariot , and go to jezreel ; for joram lay there .
and ahaziah king of judah be come down to see joram .
and there stand a watchman on the tower in jezreel , and he spy the company of jehu as he come , and say , i see a company .
and joram say , take a horseman , and send to meet they , and let he say , be it peace ?
so there go one on horseback to meet he , and say , thus saith the king , be it peace ?
and jehu say , what hast thou to do with peace ? turn thee behind i .
and the watchman tell , say , the messenger come to they , but he cometh not again .
then he send out a second on horseback , which come to they , and say , thus saith the king , be it peace ?
and jehu answer , what hast thou to do with peace ? turn thee behind i .
and the watchman tell , say , he come even unto they , and cometh not again : and the driving be like the driving of jehu the son of nimshi ; for he driveth furiously .
and joram say , make ready .
and he chariot be make ready .
and joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah go out , each in he chariot , and they go out against jehu , and meet he in the portion of naboth the jezreelite .
and it come to pass , when joram see jehu , that he say , be it peace , jehu ?
and he answer , what peace , so long as the whoredom of thy mother jezebel and she witchcraft be so many ?
and joram turn he hand , and flee , and say to ahaziah , there be treachery , o ahaziah .
and jehu draw a bow with he full strength , and smite jehoram between he arm , and the arrow go out at he heart , and he sink down in he chariot .
then say jehu to bidkar he captain , take up , and cast he in the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite : for remember how that , when i and thou ride together after ahab he father , the lord lay this burden upon he ;
surely i have see yesterday the blood of naboth , and the blood of he son , saith the lord ; and i will requite thee in this plat , saith the lord .
now therefore take and cast he into the plat of ground , accord to the word of the lord .
but when ahaziah the king of judah see this , he flee by the way of the garden house .
and jehu follow after he , and say , smite he also in the chariot .
and they do so at the go up to gur , which be by ibleam .
and he flee to megiddo , and die there .
and he servant carry he in a chariot to jerusalem , and bury he in he sepulchre with he father in the city of david .
and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab begin ahaziah to reign over judah .
and when jehu be come to jezreel , jezebel hear of it ; and she paint she face , and tire she head , and look out at a window .
and as jehu enter in at the gate , she say , have zimri peace , who slew he master ?
and he lift up he face to the window , and say , who be on my side ? who ?
and there look out to he two or three eunuch .
and he say , throw she down .
so they throw she down : and some of she blood be sprinkle on the wall , and on the horse : and he trode she under foot .
and when he be come in , he do eat and drink , and say , go , see now this cursed woman , and bury she : for she be a king 's daughter .
and they go to bury she : but they find no more of she than the skull , and the foot , and the palm of she hand .
wherefore they come again , and tell he .
and he say , this be the word of the lord , which he speak by he servant elijah the tishbite , say , in the portion of jezreel shall dog eat the flesh of jezebel :
and the carcase of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of jezreel ; so that they shall not say , this be jezebel .
and ahab have seventy son in samaria .
and jehu write letter , and send to samaria , unto the ruler of jezreel , to the elder , and to they that bring up ahab 's child , say ,
now as soon as this letter cometh to you , see you master 's son be with you , and there be with you chariot and horse , a fenced city also , and armour ;
look even out the best and meetest of you master 's son , and set he on he father 's throne , and fight for you master 's house .
but they be exceedingly afraid , and say , behold , two king stand not before he : how then shall we stand ?
and he that be over the house , and he that be over the city , the elder also , and the bringer up of the child , send to jehu , say , we be thy servant , and will do all that thou shalt bid we ; we will not make any king : do thou that which be good in thine eye .
then he write a letter the second time to they , say , if ye be mine , and if ye will hearken unto my voice , take ye the head of the man you master 's son , and come to i to jezreel by to morrow this time .
now the king 's son , be seventy person , be with the great man of the city , which bring they up .
and it come to pass , when the letter come to they , that they take the king 's son , and slew seventy person , and put they head in basket , and send he they to jezreel .
and there come a messenger , and tell he , say , they have bring the head of the king 's son .
and he say , lay ye they in two heap at the enter in of the gate until the morning .
and it come to pass in the morning , that he go out , and stand , and say to all the people , ye be righteous : behold , i conspire against my master , and slew he : but who slew all these ?
know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the lord , which the lord spake concern the house of ahab : for the lord have do that which he speak by he servant elijah .
so jehu slew all that remain of the house of ahab in jezreel , and all he great man , and he kinsfolk , and he priest , until he leave he none remain .
and he arise and depart , and come to samaria .
and as he be at the shear house in the way ,
jehu meet with the brethren of ahaziah king of judah , and say , who be ye ?
and they answer , we be the brethren of ahaziah ; and we go down to salute the child of the king and the child of the queen .
and he say , take they alive .
and they take they alive , and slew they at the pit of the shear house , even two and forty man ; neither leave he any of they .
and when he be depart thence , he light on jehonadab the son of rechab come to meet he : and he salute he , and say to he , be thine heart right , as my heart be with thy heart ?
and jehonadab answer , it be .
if it be , give i thine hand .
and he give he he hand ; and he take he up to he into the chariot .
and he say , come with i , and see my zeal for the lord .
so they make he ride in he chariot .
and when he come to samaria , he slew all that remain unto ahab in samaria , till he have destroy he , accord to the say of the lord , which he speak to elijah .
and jehu gather all the people together , and say unto they , ahab serve baal a little ; but jehu shall serve he much .
now therefore call unto i all the prophet of baal , all he servant , and all he priest ; let none be want : for i have a great sacrifice to do to baal ; whosoever shall be want , he shall not live .
but jehu do it in subtilty , to the intent that he might destroy the worshipper of baal .
and jehu say , proclaim a solemn assembly for baal .
and they proclaim it .
and jehu send through all israel : and all the worshipper of baal come , so that there be not a man leave that come not .
and they come into the house of baal ; and the house of baal be full from one end to another .
and he say unto he that be over the vestry , bring forth vestment for all the worshipper of baal .
and he bring they forth vestment .
and jehu go , and jehonadab the son of rechab , into the house of baal , and say unto the worshipper of baal , search , and look that there be here with you none of the servant of the lord , but the worshipper of baal only .
and when they go in to offer sacrifice and burnt offering , jehu appoint fourscore man without , and say , if any of the man whom i have bring into you hand escape , he that letteth he go , he life shall be for the life of he .
and it come to pass , as soon as he have make a end of offer the burnt offering , that jehu say to the guard and to the captain , go in , and slay they ; let none come forth .
and they smite they with the edge of the sword ; and the guard and the captain cast they out , and go to the city of the house of baal .
and they bring forth the image out of the house of baal , and burn they .
and they brake down the image of baal , and brake down the house of baal , and make it a draught house unto this day .
thus jehu destroy baal out of israel .
howbeit from the sin of jeroboam the son of nebat , who make israel to sin , jehu depart not from after they , to wit , the golden calf that be in bethel , and that be in dan .
and the lord say unto jehu , because thou hast do well in execute that which be right in mine eye , and hast do unto the house of ahab accord to all that be in mine heart , thy child of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel .
but jehu take no heed to walk in the law of the lord god of israel with all he heart : for he depart not from the sin of jeroboam , which make israel to sin .
in those day the lord begin to cut israel short : and hazael smite they in all the coast of israel ;
from jordan eastward , all the land of gilead , the gadites , and the reubenites , and the manassites , from aroer , which be by the river arnon , even gilead and bashan .
now the rest of the act of jehu , and all that he do , and all he might , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of israel ?
and jehu sleep with he father : and they bury he in samaria .
and jehoahaz he son reign in he stead .
and the time that jehu reign over israel in samaria be twenty and eight year .
and when athaliah the mother of ahaziah see that she son be dead , she arise and destroy all the seed royal .
but jehosheba , the daughter of king joram , sister of ahaziah , take joash the son of ahaziah , and steal he from among the king 's son which be slay ; and they hide he , even he and he nurse , in the bedchamber from athaliah , so that he be not slay .
and he be with she hide in the house of the lord six year .
and athaliah do reign over the land .
and the seventh year jehoiada send and fetch the ruler over hundred , with the captain and the guard , and bring they to he into the house of the lord , and make a covenant with they , and take a oath of they in the house of the lord , and shew they the king 's son .
and he command they , say , this be the thing that ye shall do ; a third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keeper of the watch of the king 's house ;
and a third part shall be at the gate of sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not break down .
and two part of all you that go forth on the sabbath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the lord about the king .
and ye shall compass the king round about , every man with he weapon in he hand : and he that cometh within the range , let he be slay : and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in .
and the captain over the hundred do accord to all thing that jehoiada the priest command : and they take every man he man that be to come in on the sabbath , with they that should go out on the sabbath , and come to jehoiada the priest .
and to the captain over hundred do the priest give king david 's spear and shield , that be in the temple of the lord .
and the guard stand , every man with he weapon in he hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
and he bring forth the king 's son , and put the crown upon he , and give he the testimony ; and they make he king , and anoint he ; and they clap they hand , and say , god save the king .
and when athaliah hear the noise of the guard and of the people , she come to the people into the temple of the lord .
and when she look , behold , the king stand by a pillar , as the manner be , and the prince and the trumpeter by the king , and all the people of the land rejoice , and blow with trumpet : and athaliah rent she clothes , and cry , treason , treason .
but jehoiada the priest command the captain of the hundred , the officer of the host , and say unto they , have she forth without the range : and he that followeth she kill with the sword .
for the priest have say , let she not be slay in the house of the lord .
and they lay hand on she ; and she go by the way by the which the horse come into the king 's house : and there be she slay .
and jehoiada make a covenant between the lord and the king and the people , that they should be the lord 's people ; between the king also and the people .
and all the people of the land go into the house of baal , and brake it down ; he altar and he image brake they in piece thoroughly , and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altar .
and the priest appoint officer over the house of the lord .
and he take the ruler over hundred , and the captain , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they bring down the king from the house of the lord , and come by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house .
and he sit on the throne of the king .
and all the people of the land rejoice , and the city be in quiet : and they slew athaliah with the sword beside the king 's house .
seven year old be jehoash when he begin to reign .
in the seventh year of jehu jehoash begin to reign ; and forty year reign he in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be zibiah of beersheba .
and jehoash do that which be right in the sight of the lord all he day wherein jehoiada the priest instruct he .
but the high place be not take away : the people still sacrifice and burnt incense in the high place .
and jehoash say to the priest , all the money of the dedicated thing that be bring into the house of the lord , even the money of every one that passeth the account , the money that every man be set at , and all the money that cometh into any man 's heart to bring into the house of the lord ,
let the priest take it to they , every man of he acquaintance : and let they repair the breach of the house , wheresoever any breach shall be find .
but it be so , that in the three and twentieth year of king jehoash the priest have not repair the breach of the house .
then king jehoash call for jehoiada the priest , and the other priest , and say unto they , why repair ye not the breach of the house ? now therefore receive no more money of you acquaintance , but deliver it for the breach of the house .
and the priest consent to receive no more money of the people , neither to repair the breach of the house .
but jehoiada the priest take a chest , and bore a hole in the lid of it , and set it beside the altar , on the right side as one cometh into the house of the lord : and the priest that keep the door put therein all the money that be bring into the house of the lord .
and it be so , when they see that there be much money in the chest , that the king 's scribe and the high priest come up , and they put up in bag , and tell the money that be find in the house of the lord .
and they give the money , be tell , into the hand of they that do the work , that have the oversight of the house of the lord : and they lay it out to the carpenter and builder , that work upon the house of the lord ,
and to mason , and hewer of stone , and to buy timber and hew stone to repair the breach of the house of the lord , and for all that be lay out for the house to repair it .
howbeit there be not make for the house of the lord bowl of silver , snuffer , bason , trumpet , any vessel of gold , or vessel of silver , of the money that be bring into the house of the lord :
but they give that to the workman , and repair therewith the house of the lord .
moreover they reckon not with the man , into whose hand they deliver the money to be bestow on workman : for they deal faithfully .
the trespass money and sin money be not bring into the house of the lord : it be the priest ' .
then hazael king of syria go up , and fight against gath , and take it : and hazael set he face to go up to jerusalem .
and jehoash king of judah take all the hallowed thing that jehoshaphat , and jehoram , and ahaziah , he father , king of judah , have dedicate , and he own hallowed thing , and all the gold that be find in the treasure of the house of the lord , and in the king 's house , and send it to hazael king of syria : and he go away from jerusalem .
and the rest of the act of joash , and all that he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
and he servant arise , and make a conspiracy , and slew joash in the house of millo , which goeth down to silla .
for jozachar the son of shimeath , and jehozabad the son of shomer , he servant , smite he , and he die ; and they bury he with he father in the city of david : and amaziah he son reign in he stead .

( and the lord give israel a saviour , so that they go out from under the hand of the syrians : and the child of israel dwelt in they tent , as beforetime .
nevertheless they depart not from the sin of the house of jeroboam , who make israel sin , but walk therein : and there remain the grove also in samaria . )
neither do he leave of the people to jehoahaz but fifty horseman , and ten chariot , and ten thousand footman ; for the king of syria have destroy they , and have make they like the dust by threshing .

and he put he hand upon it : and elisha put he hand upon the king 's hand .
and he say , open the window eastward .
and he open it .
then elisha say , shoot .
and he shoot .
and he say , the arrow of the lord 's deliverance , and the arrow of deliverance from syria : for thou shalt smite the syrians in aphek , till thou have consume they .
and he say , take the arrow .
and he take they .
and he say unto the king of israel , smite upon the ground .
and he smite thrice , and stay .
and the man of god be wroth with he , and say , thou shouldest have smite five or six time ; then hadst thou smitten syria till thou hadst consume it : whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice .
and elisha die , and they bury he .
and the band of the moabites invade the land at the come in of the year .
and it come to pass , as they be bury a man , that , behold , they spy a band of man ; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of elisha : and when the man be let down , and touch the bone of elisha , he revive , and stand up on he foot .
but hazael king of syria oppress israel all the day of jehoahaz .
and the lord be gracious unto they , and have compassion on they , and have respect unto they , because of he covenant with abraham , isaac , and jacob , and would not destroy they , neither cast he they from he presence as yet .

and he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord : he depart not from the sin of jeroboam the son of nebat , who make israel to sin .
in the day of pekah king of israel come tiglathpileser king of assyria , and take ijon , and abelbethmaachah , and janoah , and kedesh , and hazor , and gilead , and galilee , all the land of naphtali , and carry they captive to assyria .

he build the higher gate of the house of the lord .
now the rest of the act of jotham , and all that he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
in those day the lord begin to send against judah rezin the king of syria , and pekah the son of remaliah .
and jotham sleep with he father , and be bury with he father in the city of david he father : and ahaz he son reign in he stead .
in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham king of judah begin to reign .
twenty year old be ahaz when he begin to reign , and reign sixteen year in jerusalem , and do not that which be right in the sight of the lord he god , like david he father .
but he walk in the way of the king of israel , yea , and make he son to pass through the fire , accord to the abomination of the heathen , whom the lord cast out from before the child of israel .
and he sacrifice and burnt incense in the high place , and on the hill , and under every green tree .
then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel come up to jerusalem to war : and they besiege ahaz , but could not overcome he .
at that time rezin king of syria recover elath to syria , and drave the jews from elath : and the syrians come to elath , and dwelt there unto this day .
so ahaz send messenger to tiglathpileser king of assyria , say , i be thy servant and thy son : come up , and save i out of the hand of the king of syria , and out of the hand of the king of israel , which rise up against i .
and ahaz take the silver and gold that be find in the house of the lord , and in the treasure of the king 's house , and send it for a present to the king of assyria .
and the king of assyria hearken unto he : for the king of assyria go up against damascus , and take it , and carry the people of it captive to kir , and slew rezin .
and king ahaz go to damascus to meet tiglathpileser king of assyria , and see a altar that be at damascus : and king ahaz send to urijah the priest the fashion of the altar , and the pattern of it , accord to all the workmanship thereof .
and urijah the priest build a altar accord to all that king ahaz have send from damascus : so urijah the priest make it against king ahaz come from damascus .
and when the king be come from damascus , the king see the altar : and the king approach to the altar , and offer thereon .
and he burn he burnt offering and he meat offering , and pour he drink offering , and sprinkle the blood of he peace offering , upon the altar .
and he bring also the brasen altar , which be before the lord , from the forefront of the house , from between the altar and the house of the lord , and put it on the north side of the altar .
and king ahaz command urijah the priest , say , upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering , and the evening meat offering , and the king 's burnt sacrifice , and he meat offering , with the burnt offering of all the people of the land , and they meat offering , and they drink offering ; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering , and all the blood of the sacrifice : and the brasen altar shall be for i to enquire by .
thus do urijah the priest , accord to all that king ahaz command .
and king ahaz cut off the border of the basis , and remove the laver from off they ; and take down the sea from off the brasen ox that be under it , and put it upon a pavement of stone .
and the covert for the sabbath that they have build in the house , and the king 's entry without , turn he from the house of the lord for the king of assyria .
now the rest of the act of ahaz which he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
and ahaz sleep with he father , and be bury with he father in the city of david : and hezekiah he son reign in he stead .
in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah begin hoshea the son of elah to reign in samaria over israel nine year .
and he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord , but not as the king of israel that be before he .
against he come up shalmaneser king of assyria ; and hoshea become he servant , and give he present .
and the king of assyria find conspiracy in hoshea : for he have send messenger to so king of egypt , and bring no present to the king of assyria , as he have do year by year : therefore the king of assyria shut he up , and bind he in prison .
then the king of assyria come up throughout all the land , and go up to samaria , and besiege it three year .
in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria take samaria , and carry israel away into assyria , and place they in halah and in habor by the river of gozan , and in the city of the medes .
for so it be , that the child of israel have sin against the lord they god , which have bring they up out of the land of egypt , from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt , and have fear other god ,
and walk in the statute of the heathen , whom the lord cast out from before the child of israel , and of the king of israel , which they have make .
and the child of israel do secretly those thing that be not right against the lord they god , and they build they high place in all they city , from the tower of the watchman to the fenced city .
and they set they up image and grove in every high hill , and under every green tree :
and there they burnt incense in all the high place , as do the heathen whom the lord carry away before they ; and work wicked thing to provoke the lord to anger :
for they serve idol , whereof the lord have say unto they , ye shall not do this thing .
yet the lord testify against israel , and against judah , by all the prophet , and by all the seer , say , turn ye from you evil way , and keep my commandment and my statute , accord to all the law which i command you father , and which i send to you by my servant the prophet .
notwithstanding they would not hear , but harden they neck , like to the neck of they father , that do not believe in the lord they god .
and they reject he statute , and he covenant that he make with they father , and he testimony which he testify against they ; and they follow vanity , and become vain , and go after the heathen that be round about they , concern whom the lord have charge they , that they should not do like they .
and they leave all the commandment of the lord they god , and make they molten image , even two calf , and make a grove , and worship all the host of heaven , and serve baal .
and they cause they son and they daughter to pass through the fire , and use divination and enchantment , and sell themselves to do evil in the sight of the lord , to provoke he to anger .
therefore the lord be very angry with israel , and remove they out of he sight : there be none left but the tribe of judah only .
also judah keep not the commandment of the lord they god , but walk in the statute of israel which they make .
and the lord reject all the seed of israel , and afflict they , and deliver they into the hand of spoiler , until he have cast they out of he sight .
for he rent israel from the house of david ; and they make jeroboam the son of nebat king : and jeroboam drave israel from follow the lord , and make they sin a great sin .
for the child of israel walk in all the sin of jeroboam which he do ; they depart not from they ;
until the lord remove israel out of he sight , as he have say by all he servant the prophet .
so be israel carry away out of they own land to assyria unto this day .
and the king of assyria bring man from babylon , and from cuthah , and from ava , and from hamath , and from sepharvaim , and place they in the city of samaria instead of the child of israel : and they possess samaria , and dwelt in the city thereof .
and so it be at the beginning of they dwelling there , that they fear not the lord : therefore the lord send lion among they , which slew some of they .
wherefore they speak to the king of assyria , say , the nation which thou hast remove , and place in the city of samaria , know not the manner of the god of the land : therefore he have send lion among they , and , behold , they slay they , because they know not the manner of the god of the land .
then the king of assyria command , say , carry thither one of the priest whom ye bring from thence ; and let they go and dwell there , and let he teach they the manner of the god of the land .
then one of the priest whom they have carry away from samaria come and dwelt in bethel , and teach they how they should fear the lord .
howbeit every nation make god of they own , and put they in the house of the high place which the samaritan have make , every nation in they city wherein they dwell .
and the man of babylon make succothbenoth , and the man of cuth make nergal , and the man of hamath make ashima ,
and the avites make nibhaz and tartak , and the sepharvites burn they child in fire to adrammelech and anammelech , the god of sepharvaim .
so they fear the lord , and make unto themselves of the lowest of they priest of the high place , which sacrifice for they in the house of the high place .
they fear the lord , and serve they own god , after the manner of the nation whom they carry away from thence .
unto this day they do after the former manners : they fear not the lord , neither do they after they statute , or after they ordinance , or after the law and commandment which the lord command the child of jacob , whom he name israel ;
with whom the lord have make a covenant , and charge they , say , ye shall not fear other god , nor bow yourselve to they , nor serve they , nor sacrifice to they :
but the lord , who bring you up out of the land of egypt with great power and a stretch out arm , he shall ye fear , and he shall ye worship , and to he shall ye do sacrifice .
and the statute , and the ordinance , and the law , and the commandment , which he write for you , ye shall observe to do for evermore ; and ye shall not fear other god .
and the covenant that i have make with you ye shall not forget ; neither shall ye fear other god .
but the lord you god ye shall fear ; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all you enemy .
howbeit they do not hearken , but they do after they former manner .
so these nation fear the lord , and serve they graven image , both they child , and they child 's child : as do they father , so do they unto this day .
now it come to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel , that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah begin to reign .
twenty and five year old be he when he begin to reign ; and he reign twenty and nine year in jerusalem .
he mother 's name also be abi , the daughter of zachariah .
and he do that which be right in the sight of the lord , accord to all that david he father do .
he remove the high place , and brake the image , and cut down the grove , and brake in piece the brasen serpent that moses have make : for unto those day the child of israel do burn incense to it : and he call it nehushtan .
he trust in the lord god of israel ; so that after he be none like he among all the king of judah , nor any that be before he .
for he cleave to the lord , and depart not from follow he , but keep he commandment , which the lord command moses .
and the lord be with he ; and he prosper whithersoever he go forth : and he rebel against the king of assyria , and serve he not .
he smite the philistines , even unto gaza , and the border thereof , from the tower of the watchman to the fenced city .
and it come to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah , which be the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel , that shalmaneser king of assyria come up against samaria , and besiege it .
and at the end of three year they take it : even in the sixth year of hezekiah , that be the ninth year of hoshea king of israel , samaria be take .
and the king of assyria do carry away israel unto assyria , and put they in halah and in habor by the river of gozan , and in the city of the medes :
because they obey not the voice of the lord they god , but transgress he covenant , and all that mose the servant of the lord command , and would not hear they , nor do they .
now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah do sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the fenced city of judah , and take they .
and hezekiah king of judah send to the king of assyria to lachish , say , i have offend ; return from i : that which thou puttest on i will i bear .
and the king of assyria appoint unto hezekiah king of judah three hundred talent of silver and thirty talent of gold .
and hezekiah give he all the silver that be find in the house of the lord , and in the treasure of the king 's house .
at that time do hezekiah cut off the gold from the door of the temple of the lord , and from the pillar which hezekiah king of judah have overlay , and give it to the king of assyria .
and the king of assyria send tartan and rabsaris and rabshakeh from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem .
and they go up and come to jerusalem .
and when they be come up , they come and stand by the conduit of the upper pool , which be in the highway of the fuller 's field .
and when they have call to the king , there come out to they eliakim the son of hilkiah , which be over the household , and shebna the scribe , and joah the son of asaph the recorder .
and rabshakeh say unto they , speak ye now to hezekiah , thus saith the great king , the king of assyria , what confidence be this wherein thou trustest ?
thou sayest , ( but they be but vain word , ) i have counsel and strength for the war .
now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against i ?
now , behold , thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed , even upon egypt , on which if a man lean , it will go into he hand , and pierce it : so be pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on he .
but if ye say unto i , we trust in the lord we god : be not that he , whose high place and whose altar hezekiah have take away , and have say to judah and jerusalem , ye shall worship before this altar in jerusalem ?
now therefore , i pray thee , give pledge to my lord the king of assyria , and i will deliver thee two thousand horse , if thou be able on thy part to set rider upon they .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servant , and put thy trust on egypt for chariot and for horseman ?
be i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it ?
the lord say to i , go up against this land , and destroy it .
then say eliakim the son of hilkiah , and shebna , and joah , unto rabshakeh , speak , i pray thee , to thy servant in the syrian language ; for we understand it : and talk not with we in the jews ' language in the ear of the people that be on the wall .
but rabshakeh say unto they , hath my master send i to thy master , and to thee , to speak these word ? have he not send i to the man which sit on the wall , that they may eat they own dung , and drink they own piss with you ?
then rabshakeh stand and cry with a loud voice in the jews ' language , and spake , say , hear the word of the great king , the king of assyria :
thus saith the king , let not hezekiah deceive you : for he shall not be able to deliver you out of he hand :
neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord , say , the lord will surely deliver we , and this city shall not be deliver into the hand of the king of assyria .
hearken not to hezekiah : for thus saith the king of assyria , make a agreement with i by a present , and come out to i , and then eat ye every man of he own vine , and every one of he fig tree , and drink ye every one the water of he cistern :
until i come and take you away to a land like you own land , a land of corn and wine , a land of bread and vineyard , a land of oil olive and of honey , that ye may live , and not die : and hearken not unto hezekiah , when he persuadeth you , say , the lord will deliver we .
hath any of the god of the nation deliver at all he land out of the hand of the king of assyria ?
where be the god of hamath , and of arpad ? where be the god of sepharvaim , hena , and ivah ? have they deliver samaria out of mine hand ?
who be they among all the god of the country , that have deliver they country out of mine hand , that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of mine hand ?
but the people hold they peace , and answer he not a word : for the king 's commandment be , say , answer he not .
then come eliakim the son of hilkiah , which be over the household , and shebna the scribe , and joah the son of asaph the recorder , to hezekiah with they clothes rent , and tell he the word of rabshakeh .
and it come to pass , when king hezekiah hear it , that he rent he clothes , and cover himself with sackcloth , and go into the house of the lord .
and he send eliakim , which be over the household , and shebna the scribe , and the elder of the priest , cover with sackcloth , to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz .
and they say unto he , thus saith hezekiah , this day be a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and blasphemy ; for the child be come to the birth , and there be not strength to bring forth .
it may be the lord thy god will hear all the word of rabshakeh , whom the king of assyria he master have send to reproach the living god ; and will reprove the word which the lord thy god have hear : wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that be leave .
so the servant of king hezekiah come to isaiah .
and isaiah say unto they , thus shall ye say to you master , thus saith the lord , be not afraid of the word which thou hast hear , with which the servant of the king of assyria have blaspheme i .
behold , i will send a blast upon he , and he shall hear a rumour , and shall return to he own land ; and i will cause he to fall by the sword in he own land .
so rabshakeh return , and find the king of assyria war against libnah : for he have hear that he be depart from lachish .
and when he hear say of tirhakah king of ethiopia , behold , he be come out to fight against thee : he send messenger again unto hezekiah , say ,
thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah , say , let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee , say , jerusalem shall not be deliver into the hand of the king of assyria .
behold , thou hast hear what the king of assyria have do to all land , by destroy they utterly : and shalt thou be deliver ?
have the god of the nation deliver they which my father have destroy ; as gozan , and haran , and rezeph , and the child of eden which be in thelasar ?
where be the king of hamath , and the king of arpad , and the king of the city of sepharvaim , of hena , and ivah ?
and hezekiah receive the letter of the hand of the messenger , and read it : and hezekiah go up into the house of the lord , and spread it before the lord .
and hezekiah pray before the lord , and say , o lord god of israel , which dwellest between the cherubim , thou art the god , even thou alone , of all the kingdom of the earth ; thou hast make heaven and earth .
lord , bow down thine ear , and hear : open , lord , thine eye , and see : and hear the word of sennacherib , which have send he to reproach the living god .
of a truth , lord , the king of assyria have destroy the nation and they land ,
and have cast they god into the fire : for they be no god , but the work of man 's hand , wood and stone : therefore they have destroy they .
now therefore , o lord we god , i beseech thee , save thou we out of he hand , that all the kingdom of the earth may know that thou art the lord god , even thou only .
then isaiah the son of amoz send to hezekiah , say , thus saith the lord god of israel , that which thou hast pray to i against sennacherib king of assyria i have hear .
this be the word that the lord have speak concern he ; the virgin the daughter of zion have despise thee , and laugh thee to scorn ; the daughter of jerusalem have shake she head at thee .
whom hast thou reproach and blaspheme ? and against whom hast thou exalt thy voice , and lift up thine eye on high ? even against the holy one of israel .
by thy messenger thou hast reproach the lord , and hast say , with the multitude of my chariot i be come up to the height of the mountain , to the side of lebanon , and will cut down the tall cedar tree thereof , and the choice fir tree thereof : and i will enter into the lodgings of he border , and into the forest of he carmel .
i have dig and drunk strange water , and with the sole of my foot have i dry up all the river of besiege place .
hast thou not hear long ago how i have do it , and of ancient time that i have form it ? now have i bring it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced city into ruinous heap .
therefore they inhabitant be of small power , they be dismayed and confound ; they be as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the house top , and as corn blast before it be grow up .
but i know thy abode , and thy go out , and thy come in , and thy rage against i .
because thy rage against i and thy tumult be come up into mine ear , therefore i will put my hook in thy nose , and my bridle in thy lip , and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , ye shall eat this year such thing as grow of themselves , and in the second year that which springeth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyard , and eat the fruit thereof .
and the remnant that be escape of the house of judah shall yet again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount zion : the zeal of the lord of host shall do this .
therefore thus saith the lord concern the king of assyria , he shall not come into this city , nor shoot a arrow there , nor come before it with shield , nor cast a bank against it .
by the way that he come , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the lord .
for i will defend this city , to save it , for mine own sake , and for my servant david 's sake .
and it come to pass that night , that the angel of the lord go out , and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand : and when they arise early in the morning , behold , they be all dead corpse .
so sennacherib king of assyria depart , and go and return , and dwelt at nineveh .
and it come to pass , as he be worship in the house of nisroch he god , that adrammelech and sharezer he son smite he with the sword : and they escape into the land of armenia .
and esarhaddon he son reign in he stead .
in those day be hezekiah sick unto death .
and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz come to he , and say unto he , thus saith the lord , set thine house in order ; for thou shalt die , and not live .
then he turn he face to the wall , and pray unto the lord , say ,
i beseech thee , o lord , remember now how i have walk before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have do that which be good in thy sight .
and hezekiah weep sore .
and it come to pass , afore isaiah be go out into the middle court , that the word of the lord come to he , say ,
turn again , and tell hezekiah the captain of my people , thus saith the lord , the god of david thy father , i have hear thy prayer , i have see thy tear : behold , i will heal thee : on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord .
and i will add unto thy day fifteen year ; and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria ; and i will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant david 's sake .
and isaiah say , take a lump of fig .
and they take and lay it on the boil , and he recover .
and hezekiah say unto isaiah , what shall be the sign that the lord will heal i , and that i shall go up into the house of the lord the third day ?
and isaiah say , this sign shalt thou have of the lord , that the lord will do the thing that he have speak : shall the shadow go forward ten degree , or go back ten degree ?
and hezekiah answer , it be a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degree : nay , but let the shadow return backward ten degree .
and isaiah the prophet cry unto the lord : and he bring the shadow ten degree backward , by which it have go down in the dial of ahaz .
at that time berodachbaladan , the son of baladan , king of babylon , send letter and a present unto hezekiah : for he have hear that hezekiah have be sick .
and hezekiah hearken unto they , and shew they all the house of he precious thing , the silver , and the gold , and the spice , and the precious ointment , and all the house of he armour , and all that be find in he treasure : there be nothing in he house , nor in all he dominion , that hezekiah shew they not .
then come isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah , and say unto he , what say these man ? and from whence come they unto thee ?
and hezekiah say , they be come from a far country , even from babylon .
and he say , what have they see in thine house ?
and hezekiah answer , all the thing that be in mine house have they see : there be nothing among my treasure that i have not shew they .
and isaiah say unto hezekiah , hear the word of the lord .
behold , the day come , that all that be in thine house , and that which thy father have lay up in store unto this day , shall be carry into babylon : nothing shall be leave , saith the lord .
and of thy son that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuch in the palace of the king of babylon .
then say hezekiah unto isaiah , good be the word of the lord which thou hast speak .
and he say , be it not good , if peace and truth be in my day ?
and the rest of the act of hezekiah , and all he might , and how he make a pool , and a conduit , and bring water into the city , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
and hezekiah sleep with he father : and manasseh he son reign in he stead .
manasseh be twelve year old when he begin to reign , and reign fifty and five year in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be hephzibah .
and he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord , after the abomination of the heathen , whom the lord cast out before the child of israel .
for he build up again the high place which hezekiah he father have destroy ; and he rear up altar for baal , and make a grove , as do ahab king of israel ; and worship all the host of heaven , and serve they .
and he build altar in the house of the lord , of which the lord say , in jerusalem will i put my name .
and he build altar for all the host of heaven in the two court of the house of the lord .
and he make he son pass through the fire , and observe time , and use enchantment , and deal with familiar spirit and wizard : he work much wickedness in the sight of the lord , to provoke he to anger .
and he set a graven image of the grove that he have make in the house , of which the lord say to david , and to solomon he son , in this house , and in jerusalem , which i have choose out of all tribe of israel , will i put my name for ever :
neither will i make the foot of israel move any more out of the land which i give they father ; only if they will observe to do accord to all that i have command they , and accord to all the law that my servant moses command they .
but they hearken not : and manasseh seduce they to do more evil than do the nation whom the lord destroy before the child of israel .
and the lord spake by he servant the prophet , say ,
because manasseh king of judah have do these abomination , and have do wickedly above all that the amorites do , which be before he , and have make judah also to sin with he idol :
therefore thus saith the lord god of israel , behold , i be bring such evil upon jerusalem and judah , that whosoever heareth of it , both he ear shall tingle .
and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria , and the plummet of the house of ahab : and i will wipe jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish , wipe it , and turn it upside down .
and i will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance , and deliver they into the hand of they enemy ; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all they enemy ;
because they have do that which be evil in my sight , and have provoke i to anger , since the day they father come forth out of egypt , even unto this day .
moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much , till he have fill jerusalem from one end to another ; beside he sin wherewith he make judah to sin , in do that which be evil in the sight of the lord .
now the rest of the act of manasseh , and all that he do , and he sin that he sin , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
and manasseh sleep with he father , and be bury in the garden of he own house , in the garden of uzza : and amon he son reign in he stead .
amon be twenty and two year old when he begin to reign , and he reign two year in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be meshullemeth , the daughter of haruz of jotbah .
and he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord , as he father manasseh do .
and he walk in all the way that he father walk in , and serve the idol that he father serve , and worship they :
and he forsake the lord god of he father , and walk not in the way of the lord .
and the servant of amon conspire against he , and slew the king in he own house .
and the people of the land slew all they that have conspire against king amon ; and the people of the land make josiah he son king in he stead .
now the rest of the act of amon which he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
and he be bury in he sepulchre in the garden of uzza : and josiah he son reign in he stead .
josiah be eight year old when he begin to reign , and he reign thirty and one year in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be jedidah , the daughter of adaiah of boscath .
and he do that which be right in the sight of the lord , and walk in all the way of david he father , and turn not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and it come to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah , that the king send shaphan the son of azaliah , the son of meshullam , the scribe , to the house of the lord , say ,
go up to hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the silver which be bring into the house of the lord , which the keeper of the door have gather of the people :
and let they deliver it into the hand of the doer of the work , that have the oversight of the house of the lord : and let they give it to the doer of the work which be in the house of the lord , to repair the breach of the house ,
unto carpenter , and builder , and mason , and to buy timber and hew stone to repair the house .
howbeit there be no reckoning make with they of the money that be deliver into they hand , because they deal faithfully .
and hilkiah the high priest say unto shaphan the scribe , i have find the book of the law in the house of the lord .
and hilkiah give the book to shaphan , and he read it .
and shaphan the scribe come to the king , and bring the king word again , and say , thy servant have gather the money that be find in the house , and have deliver it into the hand of they that do the work , that have the oversight of the house of the lord .
and shaphan the scribe shew the king , say , hilkiah the priest have deliver i a book .
and shaphan read it before the king .
and it come to pass , when the king have hear the word of the book of the law , that he rent he clothes .
and the king command hilkiah the priest , and ahikam the son of shaphan , and achbor the son of michaiah , and shaphan the scribe , and asahiah a servant of the king 's , say ,
go ye , enquire of the lord for i , and for the people , and for all judah , concern the word of this book that be find : for great be the wrath of the lord that be kindle against we , because we father have not hearken unto the word of this book , to do accord unto all that which be write concern we .
so hilkiah the priest , and ahikam , and achbor , and shaphan , and asahiah , go unto huldah the prophetess , the wife of shallum the son of tikvah , the son of harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwell in jerusalem in the college ; ) and they commune with she .
and she say unto they , thus saith the lord god of israel , tell the man that send you to i ,
thus saith the lord , behold , i will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitant thereof , even all the word of the book which the king of judah have read :
because they have forsake i , and have burn incense unto other god , that they might provoke i to anger with all the work of they hand ; therefore my wrath shall be kindle against this place , and shall not be quench .
but to the king of judah which send you to enquire of the lord , thus shall ye say to he , thus saith the lord god of israel , as touch the word which thou hast hear ;
because thine heart be tender , and thou hast humble thyself before the lord , when thou heardest what i speak against this place , and against the inhabitant thereof , that they should become a desolation and a curse , and hast rent thy clothes , and weep before i ; i also have hear thee , saith the lord .
behold therefore , i will gather thee unto thy father , and thou shalt be gather into thy grave in peace ; and thine eye shall not see all the evil which i will bring upon this place .
and they bring the king word again .
and the king send , and they gather unto he all the elder of judah and of jerusalem .
and the king go up into the house of the lord , and all the man of judah and all the inhabitant of jerusalem with he , and the priest , and the prophet , and all the people , both small and great : and he read in they ear all the word of the book of the covenant which be find in the house of the lord .
and the king stand by a pillar , and make a covenant before the lord , to walk after the lord , and to keep he commandment and he testimony and he statute with all they heart and all they soul , to perform the word of this covenant that be write in this book .
and all the people stand to the covenant .
and the king command hilkiah the high priest , and the priest of the second order , and the keeper of the door , to bring forth out of the temple of the lord all the vessel that be make for baal , and for the grove , and for all the host of heaven : and he burn they without jerusalem in the field of kidron , and carry the ash of they unto bethel .
and he put down the idolatrous priest , whom the king of judah have ordain to burn incense in the high place in the city of judah , and in the place round about jerusalem ; they also that burn incense unto baal , to the sun , and to the moon , and to the planet , and to all the host of heaven .
and he bring out the grove from the house of the lord , without jerusalem , unto the brook kidron , and burn it at the brook kidron , and stamp it small to powder , and cast the powder thereof upon the grave of the child of the people .
and he brake down the house of the sodomite , that be by the house of the lord , where the woman weave hanging for the grove .
and he bring all the priest out of the city of judah , and defile the high place where the priest have burn incense , from geba to beersheba , and brake down the high place of the gate that be in the enter in of the gate of joshua the governor of the city , which be on a man 's left hand at the gate of the city .
nevertheless the priest of the high place come not up to the altar of the lord in jerusalem , but they do eat of the unleavened bread among they brethren .
and he defile topheth , which be in the valley of the child of hinnom , that no man might make he son or he daughter to pass through the fire to molech .
and he take away the horse that the king of judah have give to the sun , at the enter in of the house of the lord , by the chamber of nathanmelech the chamberlain , which be in the suburb , and burn the chariot of the sun with fire .
and the altar that be on the top of the upper chamber of ahaz , which the king of judah have make , and the altar which manasseh have make in the two court of the house of the lord , do the king beat down , and brake they down from thence , and cast the dust of they into the brook kidron .
and the high place that be before jerusalem , which be on the right hand of the mount of corruption , which solomon the king of israel have build for ashtoreth the abomination of the zidonians , and for chemosh the abomination of the moabites , and for milcom the abomination of the child of ammon , do the king defile .
and he brake in piece the image , and cut down the grove , and fill they place with the bone of man .
moreover the altar that be at bethel , and the high place which jeroboam the son of nebat , who make israel to sin , have make , both that altar and the high place he brake down , and burn the high place , and stamp it small to powder , and burn the grove .
and as josiah turn himself , he spy the sepulchre that be there in the mount , and send , and take the bone out of the sepulchre , and burn they upon the altar , and polluted it , accord to the word of the lord which the man of god proclaim , who proclaim these word .
then he say , what title be that that i see ?
and the man of the city tell he , it be the sepulchre of the man of god , which come from judah , and proclaim these thing that thou hast do against the altar of bethel .
and he say , let he alone ; let no man move he bone .
so they let he bone alone , with the bone of the prophet that come out of samaria .
and all the house also of the high place that be in the city of samaria , which the king of israel have make to provoke the lord to anger , josiah take away , and do to they accord to all the act that he have do in bethel .
and he slew all the priest of the high place that be there upon the altar , and burn man 's bone upon they , and return to jerusalem .
and the king command all the people , say , keep the passover unto the lord you god , as it be write in the book of this covenant .
surely there be not holden such a passover from the day of the judge that judge israel , nor in all the day of the king of israel , nor of the king of judah ;
but in the eighteenth year of king josiah , wherein this passover be holden to the lord in jerusalem .
moreover the worker with familiar spirit , and the wizard , and the image , and the idol , and all the abomination that be spy in the land of judah and in jerusalem , do josiah put away , that he might perform the word of the law which be write in the book that hilkiah the priest find in the house of the lord .
and like unto he be there no king before he , that turn to the lord with all he heart , and with all he soul , and with all he might , accord to all the law of moses ; neither after he arise there any like he .
notwithstanding the lord turn not from the fierceness of he great wrath , wherewith he anger be kindle against judah , because of all the provocation that manasseh have provoke he withal .
and the lord say , i will remove judah also out of my sight , as i have remove israel , and will cast off this city jerusalem which i have choose , and the house of which i say , my name shall be there .
now the rest of the act of josiah , and all that he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
in he day pharaohnechoh king of egypt go up against the king of assyria to the river euphrates : and king josiah go against he ; and he slew he at megiddo , when he have see he .
and he servant carry he in a chariot dead from megiddo , and bring he to jerusalem , and bury he in he own sepulchre .
and the people of the land take jehoahaz the son of josiah , and anoint he , and make he king in he father 's stead .
jehoahaz be twenty and three year old when he begin to reign ; and he reign three month in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be hamutal , the daughter of jeremiah of libnah .
and he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord , accord to all that he father have do .
and pharaohnechoh put he in band at riblah in the land of hamath , that he might not reign in jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of a hundred talent of silver , and a talent of gold .
and pharaohnechoh make eliakim the son of josiah king in the room of josiah he father , and turn he name to jehoiakim , and take jehoahaz away : and he come to egypt , and die there .
and jehoiakim give the silver and the gold to pharaoh ; but he tax the land to give the money accord to the commandment of pharaoh : he exact the silver and the gold of the people of the land , of every one accord to he taxation , to give it unto pharaohnechoh .
jehoiakim be twenty and five year old when he begin to reign ; and he reign eleven year in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be zebudah , the daughter of pedaiah of rumah .
and he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord , accord to all that he father have do .
in he day nebuchadnezzar king of babylon come up , and jehoiakim become he servant three year : then he turn and rebel against he .
and the lord send against he band of the chaldees , and band of the syrians , and band of the moabites , and band of the child of ammon , and send they against judah to destroy it , accord to the word of the lord , which he speak by he servant the prophet .
surely at the commandment of the lord come this upon judah , to remove they out of he sight , for the sin of manasseh , accord to all that he do ;
and also for the innocent blood that he shed : for he fill jerusalem with innocent blood ; which the lord would not pardon .
now the rest of the act of jehoiakim , and all that he do , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of judah ?
so jehoiakim sleep with he father : and jehoiachin he son reign in he stead .
and the king of egypt come not again any more out of he land : for the king of babylon have take from the river of egypt unto the river euphrates all that pertain to the king of egypt .
jehoiachin be eighteen year old when he begin to reign , and he reign in jerusalem three month .
and he mother 's name be nehushta , the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem .
and he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord , accord to all that he father have do .
at that time the servant of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon come up against jerusalem , and the city be besiege .
and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon come against the city , and he servant do besiege it .
and jehoiachin the king of judah go out to the king of babylon , he , and he mother , and he servant , and he prince , and he officer : and the king of babylon take he in the eighth year of he reign .
and he carry out thence all the treasure of the house of the lord , and the treasure of the king 's house , and cut in piece all the vessel of gold which solomon king of israel have make in the temple of the lord , as the lord have say .
and he carry away all jerusalem , and all the prince , and all the mighty man of valour , even ten thousand captive , and all the craftsman and smith : none remain , save the poorest sort of the people of the land .
and he carry away jehoiachin to babylon , and the king 's mother , and the king 's wife , and he officer , and the mighty of the land , those carry he into captivity from jerusalem to babylon .
and all the man of might , even seven thousand , and craftsman and smith a thousand , all that be strong and apt for war , even they the king of babylon bring captive to babylon .
and the king of babylon make mattaniah he father 's brother king in he stead , and change he name to zedekiah .
zedekiah be twenty and one year old when he begin to reign , and he reign eleven year in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be hamutal , the daughter of jeremiah of libnah .
and he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord , accord to all that jehoiakim have do .
for through the anger of the lord it come to pass in jerusalem and judah , until he have cast they out from he presence , that zedekiah rebel against the king of babylon .
and it come to pass in the ninth year of he reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon come , he , and all he host , against jerusalem , and pitch against it ; and they build fort against it round about .
and the city be besiege unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah .
and on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevail in the city , and there be no bread for the people of the land .
and the city be break up , and all the man of war flee by night by the way of the gate between two wall , which be by the king 's garden : ( now the chaldees be against the city round about : ) and the king go the way toward the plain .
and the army of the chaldees pursue after the king , and overtake he in the plain of jericho : and all he army be scatter from he .
so they take the king , and bring he up to the king of babylon to riblah ; and they give judgment upon he .
and they slew the son of zedekiah before he eye , and put out the eye of zedekiah , and bind he with fetter of brass , and carry he to babylon .
and in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which be the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon , come nebuzaradan , captain of the guard , a servant of the king of babylon , unto jerusalem :
and he burn the house of the lord , and the king 's house , and all the house of jerusalem , and every great man 's house burn he with fire .
and all the army of the chaldees , that be with the captain of the guard , brake down the wall of jerusalem round about .
now the rest of the people that be leave in the city , and the fugitive that fall away to the king of babylon , with the remnant of the multitude , do nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away .
but the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedresser and husbandman .
and the pillar of brass that be in the house of the lord , and the basis , and the brasen sea that be in the house of the lord , do the chaldee break in piece , and carry the brass of they to babylon .
and the pot , and the shovel , and the snuffer , and the spoon , and all the vessel of brass wherewith they minister , take they away .
and the firepan , and the bowl , and such thing as be of gold , in gold , and of silver , in silver , the captain of the guard take away .
the two pillar , one sea , and the basis which solomon have make for the house of the lord ; the brass of all these vessel be without weight .
the height of the one pillar be eighteen cubit , and the chapiter upon it be brass : and the height of the chapiter three cubit ; and the wreathen work , and pomegranate upon the chapiter round about , all of brass : and like unto these have the second pillar with wreathen work .
and the captain of the guard take seraiah the chief priest , and zephaniah the second priest , and the three keeper of the door :
and out of the city he take a officer that be set over the man of war , and five man of they that be in the king 's presence , which be find in the city , and the principal scribe of the host , which muster the people of the land , and threescore man of the people of the land that be find in the city :
and nebuzaradan captain of the guard take these , and bring they to the king of babylon to riblah :
and the king of babylon smite they , and slew they at riblah in the land of hamath .
so judah be carry away out of they land .
and as for the people that remain in the land of judah , whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon have leave , even over they he make gedaliah the son of ahikam , the son of shaphan , ruler .
and when all the captain of the army , they and they man , hear that the king of babylon have make gedaliah governor , there come to gedaliah to mizpah , even ishmael the son of nethaniah , and johanan the son of careah , and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite , and jaazaniah the son of a maachathite , they and they man .
and gedaliah sware to they , and to they man , and say unto they , fear not to be the servant of the chaldees : dwell in the land , and serve the king of babylon ; and it shall be well with you .
but it come to pass in the seventh month , that ishmael the son of nethaniah , the son of elishama , of the seed royal , come , and ten man with he , and smite gedaliah , that he die , and the jews and the chaldee that be with he at mizpah .
and all the people , both small and great , and the captain of the army , arise , and come to egypt : for they be afraid of the chaldees .
and it come to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah , in the twelfth month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , that evilmerodach king of babylon in the year that he begin to reign do lift up the head of jehoiachin king of judah out of prison ;
and he speak kindly to he , and set he throne above the throne of the king that be with he in babylon ;
and change he prison garment : and he do eat bread continually before he all the day of he life .
and he allowance be a continual allowance give he of the king , a daily rate for every day , all the day of he life .

and azel have six son , whose name be these , azrikam , bocheru , and ishmael , and sheariah , and obadiah , and hanan : these be the son of azel .
now the philistines fight against israel ; and the man of israel flee from before the philistines , and fall down slay in mount gilboa .
and the philistine follow hard after saul , and after he son ; and the philistines slew jonathan , and abinadab , and malchishua , the son of saul .
and the battle go sore against saul , and the archer hit he , and he be wound of the archer .
then say saul to he armourbearer , draw thy sword , and thrust i through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse i .
but he armourbearer would not ; for he be sore afraid .
so saul take a sword , and fall upon it .
and when he armourbearer see that saul be dead , he fall likewise on the sword , and die .
so saul die , and he three son , and all he house die together .
and when all the man of israel that be in the valley see that they flee , and that saul and he son be dead , then they forsake they city , and flee : and the philistines come and dwelt in they .
and it come to pass on the morrow , when the philistines come to strip the slay , that they find saul and he son fall in mount gilboa .
and when they have strip he , they take he head , and he armour , and send into the land of the philistine round about , to carry tiding unto they idol , and to the people .
and they put he armour in the house of they god , and fasten he head in the temple of dagon .
and when all jabeshgilead hear all that the philistines have do to saul ,
they arise , all the valiant man , and take away the body of saul , and the body of he son , and bring they to jabesh , and bury they bone under the oak in jabesh , and fast seven day .
so saul die for he transgression which he commit against the lord , even against the word of the lord , which he keep not , and also for ask counsel of one that have a familiar spirit , to enquire of it ;
and enquire not of the lord : therefore he slew he , and turn the kingdom unto david the son of jesse .
then all israel gather themselves to david unto hebron , say , behold , we be thy bone and thy flesh .
and moreover in time past , even when saul be king , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel : and the lord thy god say unto thee , thou shalt feed my people israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people israel .
therefore come all the elder of israel to the king to hebron ; and david make a covenant with they in hebron before the lord ; and they anoint david king over israel , accord to the word of the lord by samuel .
and david and all israel go to jerusalem , which be jebus ; where the jebusites be , the inhabitant of the land .
and the inhabitant of jebus say to david , thou shalt not come hither .
nevertheless david take the castle of zion , which be the city of david .
and david say , whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall be chief and captain .
so joab the son of zeruiah go first up , and be chief .
and david dwelt in the castle ; therefore they call it the city of david .
and he build the city round about , even from millo round about : and joab repair the rest of the city .
so david wax greater and greater : for the lord of host be with he .
these also be the chief of the mighty man whom david have , who strengthen themselves with he in he kingdom , and with all israel , to make he king , accord to the word of the lord concern israel .
and this be the number of the mighty man whom david have ; jashobeam , a hachmonite , the chief of the captain : he lift up he spear against three hundred slay by he at one time .

he be with david at pasdammim , and there the philistines be gather together to battle , where be a parcel of ground full of barley ; and the people flee from before the philistines .
and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel , and deliver it , and slew the philistines ; and the lord save they by a great deliverance .
now three of the thirty captain go down to the rock to david , into the cave of adullam ; and the host of the philistine encamp in the valley of rephaim .
and david be then in the hold , and the philistines ' garrison be then at bethlehem .
and david long , and say , oh that one would give i drink of the water of the well of bethlehem , that be at the gate !
and the three brake through the host of the philistines , and draw water out of the well of bethlehem , that be by the gate , and take it , and bring it to david : but david would not drink of it , but pour it out to the lord ,
and say , my god forbid it i , that i should do this thing : shall i drink the blood of these man that have put they life in jeopardy ? for with the jeopardy of they life they bring it .
therefore he would not drink it .
these thing do these three mightiest .
and abishai the brother of joab , he be chief of the three : for lift up he spear against three hundred , he slew they , and have a name among the three .
of the three , he be more honourable than the two ; for he be they captain : howbeit he attain not to the first three .
benaiah the son of jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of kabzeel , who have do many act ; he slew two lionlike man of moab : also he go down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day .
and he slew a egyptian , a man of great stature , five cubit high ; and in the egyptian 's hand be a spear like a weaver 's beam ; and he go down to he with a staff , and pluck the spear out of the egyptian 's hand , and slew he with he own spear .

then the spirit come upon amasai , who be chief of the captain , and he say , thine be we , david , and on thy side , thou son of jesse : peace , peace be unto thee , and peace be to thine helper ; for thy god helpeth thee .
then david receive they , and make they captain of the band .
and there fall some of manasseh to david , when he come with the philistines against saul to battle : but they help they not : for the lord of the philistines upon advisement send he away , say , he will fall to he master saul to the jeopardy of we head .
as he go to ziklag , there fall to he of manasseh , adnah , and jozabad , and jediael , and michael , and jozabad , and elihu , and zilthai , captain of the thousand that be of manasseh .

for at that time day by day there come to david to help he , until it be a great host , like the host of god .
and these be the number of the band that be ready arm to the war , and come to david to hebron , to turn the kingdom of saul to he , accord to the word of the lord .

and let we bring again the ark of we god to we : for we enquire not at it in the day of saul .
and all the congregation say that they would do so : for the thing be right in the eye of all the people .
so david gather all israel together , from shihor of egypt even unto the enter of hemath , to bring the ark of god from kirjathjearim .
and david go up , and all israel , to baalah , that be , to kirjathjearim , which belong to judah , to bring up thence the ark of god the lord , that dwelleth between the cherubim , whose name be call on it .

and david be displeased , because the lord have make a breach upon uzza : wherefore that place be call perezuzza to this day .
and david be afraid of god that day , say , how shall i bring the ark of god home to i ?

and the ark of god remain with the family of obededom in he house three month .
and the lord bless the house of obededom , and all that he have .

and david perceive that the lord have confirm he king over israel , for he kingdom be lift up on high , because of he people israel .
and david take more wife at jerusalem : and david beget more son and daughter .

and ibhar , and elishua , and elpalet ,
and nogah , and nepheg , and japhia ,
and elishama , and beeliada , and eliphalet .
and when the philistines hear that david be anointed king over all israel , all the philistines go up to seek david .
and david hear of it , and go out against they .
and the philistines come and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim .
and david enquire of god , say , shall i go up against the philistines ?
and wilt thou deliver they into mine hand ?
and the lord say unto he , go up ; for i will deliver they into thine hand .
so they come up to baalperazim ; and david smite they there .
then david say , god have break in upon mine enemy by mine hand like the break forth of water : therefore they call the name of that place baalperazim .
and when they have leave they god there , david give a commandment , and they be burn with fire .
and the philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley .
therefore david enquire again of god ; and god say unto he , go not up after they ; turn away from they , and come upon they over against the mulberry tree .
and it shall be , when thou shalt hear a sound of go in the top of the mulberry tree , that then thou shalt go out to battle : for god be go forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines .
david therefore do as god command he : and they smite the host of the philistines from gibeon even to gazer .
and the fame of david go out into all land ; and the lord bring the fear of he upon all nation .
and david make he house in the city of david , and prepare a place for the ark of god , and pitch for it a tent .
then david say , none ought to carry the ark of god but the levites : for they have the lord choose to carry the ark of god , and to minister unto he for ever .
and david gather all israel together to jerusalem , to bring up the ark of the lord unto he place , which he have prepare for it .
and david assemble the child of aaron , and the levites :
of the son of kohath ; uriel the chief , and he brethren a hundred and twenty :
of the son of merari ; asaiah the chief , and he brethren two hundred and twenty :
of the son of gershom ; joel the chief , and he brethren a hundred and thirty :
of the son of elizaphan ; shemaiah the chief , and he brethren two hundred :
of the son of hebron ; eliel the chief , and he brethren fourscore :
of the son of uzziel ; amminadab the chief , and he brethren a hundred and twelve .
and david call for zadok and abiathar the priest , and for the levites , for uriel , asaiah , and joel , shemaiah , and eliel , and amminadab ,
and say unto they , ye be the chief of the father of the levites : sanctify yourselve , both ye and you brethren , that ye may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto the place that i have prepare for it .
for because ye do it not at the first , the lord we god make a breach upon we , for that we seek he not after the due order .
so the priest and the levites sanctify themselves to bring up the ark of the lord god of israel .
and the child of the levites bare the ark of god upon they shoulder with the stave thereon , as moses command accord to the word of the lord .
and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint they brethren to be the singer with instrument of musick , psaltery and harp and cymbal , sound , by lift up the voice with joy .
so the levites appoint heman the son of joel ; and of he brethren , asaph the son of berechiah ; and of the son of merari they brethren , ethan the son of kushaiah ;
and with they they brethren of the second degree , zechariah , ben , and jaaziel , and shemiramoth , and jehiel , and unni , eliab , and benaiah , and maaseiah , and mattithiah , and elipheleh , and mikneiah , and obededom , and jeiel , the porter .
so the singer , heman , asaph , and ethan , be appoint to sound with cymbal of brass ;
and zechariah , and aziel , and shemiramoth , and jehiel , and unni , and eliab , and maaseiah , and benaiah , with psaltery on alamoth ;
and mattithiah , and elipheleh , and mikneiah , and obededom , and jeiel , and azaziah , with harp on the sheminith to excel .
and chenaniah , chief of the levites , be for song : he instruct about the song , because he be skilful .
and berechiah and elkanah be doorkeeper for the ark .
and shebaniah , and jehoshaphat , and nethaneel , and amasai , and zechariah , and benaiah , and eliezer , the priest , do blow with the trumpet before the ark of god : and obededom and jehiah be doorkeeper for the ark .
so david , and the elder of israel , and the captain over thousand , go to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the house of obededom with joy .
and it come to pass , when god help the levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord , that they offer seven bullock and seven ram .
and david be clothe with a robe of fine linen , and all the levites that bare the ark , and the singer , and chenaniah the master of the song with the singer : david also have upon he a ephod of linen .
thus all israel bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shout , and with sound of the cornet , and with trumpet , and with cymbal , make a noise with psaltery and harp .
and it come to pass , as the ark of the covenant of the lord come to the city of david , that michal , the daughter of saul look out at a window see king david dancing and playing : and she despise he in she heart .
so they bring the ark of god , and set it in the midst of the tent that david have pitch for it : and they offer burnt sacrifice and peace offering before god .
and when david have make a end of offer the burnt offering and the peace offering , he bless the people in the name of the lord .
and he deal to every one of israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine .
and he appoint certain of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord , and to record , and to thank and praise the lord god of israel :
asaph the chief , and next to he zechariah , jeiel , and shemiramoth , and jehiel , and mattithiah , and eliab , and benaiah , and obededom : and jeiel with psaltery and with harp ; but asaph make a sound with cymbal ;
benaiah also and jahaziel the priest with trumpet continually before the ark of the covenant of god .
then on that day david deliver first this psalm to thank the lord into the hand of asaph and he brethren .
give thanks unto the lord , call upon he name , make know he deed among the people .
sing unto he , sing psalm unto he , talk ye of all he wondrous work .
glory ye in he holy name : let the heart of they rejoice that seek the lord .
seek the lord and he strength , seek he face continually .
remember he marvellous work that he have do , he wonder , and the judgment of he mouth ;
o ye seed of israel he servant , ye child of jacob , he chosen one .
he be the lord we god ; he judgment be in all the earth .
be ye mindful always of he covenant ; the word which he command to a thousand generation ;
even of the covenant which he make with abraham , and of he oath unto isaac ;
and have confirm the same to jacob for a law , and to israel for a everlasting covenant ,
say , unto thee will i give the land of canaan , the lot of you inheritance ;
when ye be but few , even a few , and stranger in it .
and when they go from nation to nation , and from one kingdom to another people ;
he suffer no man to do they wrong : yea , he reprove king for they sake ,
say , touch not mine anointed , and do my prophet no harm .
sing unto the lord , all the earth ; shew forth from day to day he salvation .
declare he glory among the heathen ; he marvellous work among all nation .
for great be the lord , and greatly to be praise : he also be to be fear above all god .
for all the god of the people be idol : but the lord make the heaven .
glory and honour be in he presence ; strength and gladness be in he place .
give unto the lord , ye kindred of the people , give unto the lord glory and strength .
give unto the lord the glory due unto he name : bring a offering , and come before he : worship the lord in the beauty of holiness .
fear before he , all the earth : the world also shall be stable , that it be not move .
let the heaven be glad , and let the earth rejoice : and let man say among the nation , the lord reigneth .
let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof : let the field rejoice , and all that be therein .
then shall the tree of the wood sing out at the presence of the lord , because he cometh to judge the earth .
o give thanks unto the lord ; for he be good ; for he mercy endureth for ever .
and say ye , save we , o god of we salvation , and gather we together , and deliver we from the heathen , that we may give thanks to thy holy name , and glory in thy praise .
bless be the lord god of israel for ever and ever .
and all the people say , amen , and praise the lord .
so he leave there before the ark of the covenant of the lord asaph and he brethren , to minister before the ark continually , as every day 's work require :
and obededom with they brethren , threescore and eight ; obededom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to be porter :
and zadok the priest , and he brethren the priest , before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that be at gibeon ,
to offer burnt offering unto the lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening , and to do accord to all that be write in the law of the lord , which he command israel ;
and with they heman and jeduthun , and the rest that be choose , who be express by name , to give thanks to the lord , because he mercy endureth for ever ;
and with they heman and jeduthun with trumpet and cymbal for those that should make a sound , and with musical instrument of god .
and the son of jeduthun be porter .
and all the people depart every man to he house : and david return to bless he house .
now it come to pass , as david sit in he house , that david say to nathan the prophet , lo , i dwell in a house of cedar , but the ark of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtain .
then nathan say unto david , do all that be in thine heart ; for god be with thee .
and it come to pass the same night , that the word of god come to nathan , say ,
go and tell david my servant , thus saith the lord , thou shalt not build i a house to dwell in :
for i have not dwell in a house since the day that i bring up israel unto this day ; but have go from tent to tent , and from one tabernacle to another .
wheresoever i have walk with all israel , spake i a word to any of the judge of israel , whom i command to feed my people , say , why have ye not build i a house of cedar ?
now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david , thus saith the lord of host , i take thee from the sheepcote , even from follow the sheep , that thou shouldest be ruler over my people israel :
and i have be with thee whithersoever thou hast walk , and have cut off all thine enemy from before thee , and have make thee a name like the name of the great man that be in the earth .
also i will ordain a place for my people israel , and will plant they , and they shall dwell in they place , and shall be move no more ; neither shall the child of wickedness waste they any more , as at the beginning ,
and since the time that i command judge to be over my people israel .
moreover i will subdue all thine enemy .
furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee a house .
and it shall come to pass , when thy day be expire that thou must go to be with thy father , that i will raise up thy seed after thee , which shall be of thy son ; and i will establish he kingdom .
he shall build i a house , and i will stablish he throne for ever .
i will be he father , and he shall be my son : and i will not take my mercy away from he , as i take it from he that be before thee :
but i will settle he in mine house and in my kingdom for ever : and he throne shall be establish for evermore .
accord to all these word , and accord to all this vision , so do nathan speak unto david .
and david the king come and sit before the lord , and say , who be i , o lord god , and what be mine house , that thou hast bring i hitherto ?
and yet this be a small thing in thine eye , o god ; for thou hast also speak of thy servant 's house for a great while to come , and hast regard i accord to the estate of a man of high degree , o lord god .
what can david speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant ? for thou knowest thy servant .
o lord , for thy servant 's sake , and accord to thine own heart , hast thou do all this greatness , in make know all these great thing .
o lord , there be none like thee , neither be there any god beside thee , accord to all that we have hear with we ear .
and what one nation in the earth be like thy people israel , whom god go to redeem to be he own people , to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness , by drive out nation from before thy people , whom thou hast redeem out of egypt ?
for thy people israel do thou make thine own people for ever ; and thou , lord , becamest they god .
therefore now , lord , let the thing that thou hast speak concern thy servant and concern he house be establish for ever , and do as thou hast say .
let it even be establish , that thy name may be magnify for ever , say , the lord of host be the god of israel , even a god to israel : and let the house of david thy servant be establish before thee .
for thou , o my god , hast tell thy servant that thou wilt build he a house : therefore thy servant have find in he heart to pray before thee .
and now , lord , thou art god , and hast promise this goodness unto thy servant :
now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may be before thee for ever : for thou blessest , o lord , and it shall be bless for ever .
now after this it come to pass , that david smite the philistines , and subdue they , and take gath and she town out of the hand of the philistines .
and he smite moab ; and the moabites become david 's servant , and bring gift .
and david smite hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath , as he go to stablish he dominion by the river euphrates .
and david take from he a thousand chariot , and seven thousand horseman , and twenty thousand footman : david also hough all the chariot horse , but reserve of they a hundred chariot .
and when the syrians of damascus come to help hadarezer king of zobah , david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand man .
then david put garrison in syriadamascus ; and the syrians become david 's servant , and bring gift .
thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he go .
and david take the shield of gold that be on the servant of hadarezer , and bring they to jerusalem .
likewise from tibhath , and from chun , city of hadarezer , bring david very much brass , wherewith solomon make the brasen sea , and the pillar , and the vessel of brass .
now when tou king of hamath hear how david have smite all the host of hadarezer king of zobah ;
he send hadoram he son to king david , to enquire of he welfare , and to congratulate he , because he have fight against hadarezer , and smitten he ; ( for hadarezer have war with tou ; ) and with he all manner of vessel of gold and silver and brass .
them also king david dedicate unto the lord , with the silver and the gold that he bring from all these nation ; from edom , and from moab , and from the child of ammon , and from the philistines , and from amalek .
moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand .
and he put garrison in edom ; and all the edomites become david 's servant .
thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he go .
so david reign over all israel , and execute judgment and justice among all he people .
and joab the son of zeruiah be over the host ; and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud , recorder .
and zadok the son of ahitub , and abimelech the son of abiathar , be the priest ; and shavsha be scribe ;
and benaiah the son of jehoiada be over the cherethites and the pelethites ; and the son of david be chief about the king .
now it come to pass after this , that nahash the king of the child of ammon die , and he son reign in he stead .
and david say , i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash , because he father shew kindness to i .
and david send messenger to comfort he concern he father .
so the servant of david come into the land of the child of ammon to hanun , to comfort he .
but the prince of the child of ammon say to hanun , thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father , that he have send comforter unto thee ? be not he servant come unto thee for to search , and to overthrow , and to spy out the land ?
wherefore hanun take david 's servant , and shave they , and cut off they garment in the midst hard by they buttock , and send they away .
then there go certain , and tell david how the man be serve .
and he send to meet they : for the man be greatly ashamed .
and the king say , tarry at jericho until you beard be grow , and then return .
and when the child of ammon see that they have make themselves odious to david , hanun and the child of ammon send a thousand talent of silver to hire they chariot and horseman out of mesopotamia , and out of syriamaachah , and out of zobah .
so they hire thirty and two thousand chariot , and the king of maachah and he people ; who come and pitch before medeba .
and the child of ammon gather themselves together from they city , and come to battle .
and when david hear of it , he send joab , and all the host of the mighty man .
and the child of ammon come out , and put the battle in array before the gate of the city : and the king that be come be by themselves in the field .
now when joab see that the battle be set against he before and behind , he choose out of all the choice of israel , and put they in array against the syrians .
and the rest of the people he deliver unto the hand of abishai he brother , and they set themselves in array against the child of ammon .
and he say , if the syrians be too strong for i , then thou shalt help i : but if the child of ammon be too strong for thee , then i will help thee .
be of good courage , and let we behave ourselves valiantly for we people , and for the city of we god : and let the lord do that which be good in he sight .
so joab and the people that be with he draw nigh before the syrians unto the battle ; and they flee before he .
and when the child of ammon see that the syrians be flee , they likewise flee before abishai he brother , and enter into the city .
then joab come to jerusalem .
and when the syrians see that they be put to the worse before israel , they send messenger , and draw forth the syrians that be beyond the river : and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer go before they .
and it be tell david ; and he gather all israel , and pass over jordan , and come upon they , and set the battle in array against they .
so when david have put the battle in array against the syrians , they fight with he .
but the syrians flee before israel ; and david slew of the syrians seven thousand man which fight in chariot , and forty thousand footman , and kill shophach the captain of the host .
and when the servant of hadarezer see that they be put to the worse before israel , they make peace with david , and become he servant : neither would the syrians help the child of ammon any more .
and it come to pass , that after the year be expire , at the time that king go out to battle , joab lead forth the power of the army , and waste the country of the child of ammon , and come and besiege rabbah .
but david tarry at jerusalem .
and joab smite rabbah , and destroy it .
and david take the crown of they king from off he head , and find it to weigh a talent of gold , and there be precious stone in it ; and it be set upon david 's head : and he bring also exceed much spoil out of the city .
and he bring out the people that be in it , and cut they with saw , and with harrow of iron , and with axis .
even so deal david with all the city of the child of ammon .
and david and all the people return to jerusalem .
and it come to pass after this , that there arise war at gezer with the philistines ; at which time sibbechai the hushathite slew sippai , that be of the child of the giant : and they be subdue .
and there be war again with the philistines ; and elhanan the son of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite , whose spear staff be like a weaver 's beam .
and yet again there be war at gath , where be a man of great stature , whose finger and toe be four and twenty , six on each hand , and six on each foot and he also be the son of the giant .
but when he defy israel , jonathan the son of shimea david 's brother slew he .
these be bear unto the giant in gath ; and they fall by the hand of david , and by the hand of he servant .
and satan stand up against israel , and provoke david to number israel .
and david say to joab and to the ruler of the people , go , number israel from beersheba even to dan ; and bring the number of they to i , that i may know it .
and joab answer , the lord make he people a hundred time so many more as they be : but , my lord the king , be they not all my lord 's servant ? why then doth my lord require this thing ? why will he be a cause of trespass to israel ?
nevertheless the king 's word prevail against joab .
wherefore joab depart , and go throughout all israel , and come to jerusalem .
and joab give the sum of the number of the people unto david .
and all they of israel be a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand man that draw sword : and judah be four hundred threescore and ten thousand man that draw sword .
but levi and benjamin count he not among they : for the king 's word be abominable to joab .
and god be displeased with this thing ; therefore he smite israel .
and david say unto god , i have sin greatly , because i have do this thing : but now , i beseech thee , do away the iniquity of thy servant ; for i have do very foolishly .
and the lord speak unto gad , david 's seer , say ,
go and tell david , say , thus saith the lord , i offer thee three thing : choose thee one of they , that i may do it unto thee .
so gad come to david , and say unto he , thus saith the lord , choose thee
either three year ' famine ; or three month to be destroy before thy foe , while that the sword of thine enemy overtaketh thee ; or else three day the sword of the lord , even the pestilence , in the land , and the angel of the lord destroy throughout all the coast of israel .
now therefore advise thyself what word i shall bring again to he that send i .
and david say unto gad , i be in a great strait : let i fall now into the hand of the lord ; for very great be he mercy : but let i not fall into the hand of man .
so the lord send pestilence upon israel : and there fall of israel seventy thousand man .
and god send a angel unto jerusalem to destroy it : and as he be destroy , the lord behold , and he repent he of the evil , and say to the angel that destroy , it be enough , stay now thine hand .
and the angel of the lord stand by the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite .
and david lift up he eye , and see the angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven , have a draw sword in he hand stretch out over jerusalem .
then david and the elder of israel , who be clothe in sackcloth , fall upon they face .
and david say unto god , be it not i that command the people to be number ? even i it be that have sin and do evil indeed ; but as for these sheep , what have they do ? let thine hand , i pray thee , o lord my god , be on i , and on my father 's house ; but not on thy people , that they should be plague .
then the angel of the lord command gad to say to david , that david should go up , and set up a altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite .
and david go up at the say of gad , which he speak in the name of the lord .
and ornan turn back , and see the angel ; and he four son with he hide themselves .
now ornan be threshing wheat .
and as david come to ornan , ornan look and see david , and go out of the threshingfloor , and bow himself to david with he face to the ground .
then david say to ornan , grant i the place of this threshingfloor , that i may build a altar therein unto the lord : thou shalt grant it i for the full price : that the plague may be stay from the people .
and ornan say unto david , take it to thee , and let my lord the king do that which be good in he eye : lo , i give thee the ox also for burnt offering , and the threshing instrument for wood , and the wheat for the meat offering ; i give it all .
and king david say to ornan , nay ; but i will verily buy it for the full price : for i will not take that which be thine for the lord , nor offer burnt offering without cost .
so david give to ornan for the place six hundred shekel of gold by weight .
and david build there a altar unto the lord , and offer burnt offering and peace offering , and call upon the lord ; and he answer he from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering .
and the lord command the angel ; and he put up he sword again into the sheath thereof .
at that time when david see that the lord have answer he in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite , then he sacrifice there .
for the tabernacle of the lord , which mose make in the wilderness , and the altar of the burnt offering , be at that season in the high place at gibeon .
but david could not go before it to enquire of god : for he be afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord .
then david say , this be the house of the lord god , and this be the altar of the burnt offering for israel .
and david command to gather together the stranger that be in the land of israel ; and he set mason to hew work stone to build the house of god .
and david prepare iron in abundance for the nail for the door of the gate , and for the joining ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
also cedar tree in abundance : for the zidonians and they of tyre bring much cedar wood to david .
and david say , solomon my son be young and tender , and the house that be to be build for the lord must be exceed magnifical , of fame and of glory throughout all country : i will therefore now make preparation for it .
so david prepare abundantly before he death .
then he call for solomon he son , and charge he to build a house for the lord god of israel .
and david say to solomon , my son , as for i , it be in my mind to build a house unto the name of the lord my god :
but the word of the lord come to i , say , thou hast shed blood abundantly , and hast make great war : thou shalt not build a house unto my name , because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight .
behold , a son shall be bear to thee , who shall be a man of rest ; and i will give he rest from all he enemy round about : for he name shall be solomon , and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in he day .
he shall build a house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and i will be he father ; and i will establish the throne of he kingdom over israel for ever .
now , my son , the lord be with thee ; and prosper thou , and build the house of the lord thy god , as he have say of thee .
only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding , and give thee charge concern israel , that thou mayest keep the law of the lord thy god .
then shalt thou prosper , if thou takest heed to fulfil the statute and judgment which the lord charge mose with concern israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dread not , nor be dismay .
now , behold , in my trouble i have prepare for the house of the lord a hundred thousand talent of gold , and a thousand thousand talent of silver ; and of brass and iron without weight ; for it be in abundance : timber also and stone have i prepare ; and thou mayest add thereto .
moreover there be workman with thee in abundance , hewer and worker of stone and timber , and all manner of cunning man for every manner of work .
of the gold , the silver , and the brass , and the iron , there be no number .
arise therefore , and be do , and the lord be with thee .
david also command all the prince of israel to help solomon he son , say ,
be not the lord you god with you ? and have he not give you rest on every side ? for he have give the inhabitant of the land into mine hand ; and the land be subdue before the lord , and before he people .
now set you heart and you soul to seek the lord you god ; arise therefore , and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god , to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord , and the holy vessel of god , into the house that be to be build to the name of the lord .
so when david be old and full of day , he make solomon he son king over israel .
and he gather together all the prince of israel , with the priest and the levites .
now the levites be number from the age of thirty year and upward : and they number by they poll , man by man , be thirty and eight thousand .
of which , twenty and four thousand be to set forward the work of the house of the lord ; and six thousand be officer and judge :
moreover four thousand be porter ; and four thousand praise the lord with the instrument which i make , say david , to praise therewith .
and david divide they into course among the son of levi , namely , gershon , kohath , and merari .
of the gershonites be , laadan , and shimei .
the son of laadan ; the chief be jehiel , and zetham , and joel , three .
the son of shimei ; shelomith , and haziel , and haran , three .
these be the chief of the father of laadan .
and the son of shimei be , jahath , zina , and jeush , and beriah .
these four be the son of shimei .
and jahath be the chief , and zizah the second : but jeush and beriah have not many son ; therefore they be in one reckoning , accord to they father 's house .
the son of kohath ; amram , izhar , hebron , and uzziel , four .
the son of amram ; aaron and moses : and aaron be separate , that he should sanctify the most holy thing , he and he son for ever , to burn incense before the lord , to minister unto he , and to bless in he name for ever .
now concern moses the man of god , he son be name of the tribe of levi .
the son of mose be , gershom , and eliezer .
of the son of gershom , shebuel be the chief .
and the son of eliezer be , rehabiah the chief .
and eliezer have none other son ; but the son of rehabiah be very many .
of the son of izhar ; shelomith the chief .
of the son of hebron ; jeriah the first , amariah the second , jahaziel the third , and jekameam the fourth .
of the son of uzziel ; micah the first , and jesiah the second .
the son of merari ; mahli , and mushi .
the son of mahli ; eleazar , and kish .
and eleazar die , and have no son , but daughter : and they brethren the son of kish take they .
the son of mushi ; mahli , and eder , and jeremoth , three .
these be the son of levi after the house of they father ; even the chief of the father , as they be count by number of name by they poll , that do the work for the service of the house of the lord , from the age of twenty year and upward .
for david say , the lord god of israel have give rest unto he people , that they may dwell in jerusalem for ever :
and also unto the levites ; they shall no more carry the tabernacle , nor any vessel of it for the service thereof .
for by the last word of david the levites be number from twenty year old and above :
because they office be to wait on the son of aaron for the service of the house of the lord , in the court , and in the chamber , and in the purifying of all holy thing , and the work of the service of the house of god ;
both for the shewbread , and for the fine flour for meat offering , and for the unleavened cake , and for that which be baked in the pan , and for that which be fry , and for all manner of measure and size ;
and to stand every morning to thank and praise the lord , and likewise at even ;
and to offer all burnt sacrifice unto the lord in the sabbath , in the new moon , and on the set feast , by number , accord to the order command unto they , continually before the lord :
and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the charge of the holy place , and the charge of the son of aaron they brethren , in the service of the house of the lord .
now these be the division of the son of aaron .
the son of aaron ; nadab , and abihu , eleazar , and ithamar .
but nadab and abihu die before they father , and have no child : therefore eleazar and ithamar execute the priest 's office .
and david distribute they , both zadok of the son of eleazar , and ahimelech of the son of ithamar , accord to they office in they service .
and there be more chief man find of the son of eleazar than of the son of ithamar ; and thus be they divide .
among the son of eleazar there be sixteen chief man of the house of they father , and eight among the son of ithamar accord to the house of they father .
thus be they divide by lot , one sort with another ; for the governor of the sanctuary , and governor of the house of god , be of the son of eleazar , and of the son of ithamar .

wherefore david bless the lord before all the congregation : and david say , blessed be thou , lord god of israel we father , for ever and ever .
thine , o lord , be the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the majesty : for all that be in the heaven and in the earth be thine ; thine be the kingdom , o lord , and thou art exalt as head above all .
both riches and honour come of thee , and thou reignest over all ; and in thine hand be power and might ; and in thine hand it be to make great , and to give strength unto all .
now therefore , we god , we thank thee , and praise thy glorious name .
but who be i , and what be my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort ? for all thing come of thee , and of thine own have we give thee .
for we be stranger before thee , and sojourner , as be all we father : we day on the earth be as a shadow , and there be none abide .
o lord we god , all this store that we have prepare to build thee a house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand , and be all thine own .
i know also , my god , that thou triest the heart , and hast pleasure in uprightness .
as for i , in the uprightness of mine heart i have willingly offer all these thing : and now have i see with joy thy people , which be present here , to offer willingly unto thee .
o lord god of abraham , isaac , and of israel , we father , keep this for ever in the imagination of the thought of the heart of thy people , and prepare they heart unto thee :
and give unto solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep thy commandment , thy testimony , and thy statute , and to do all these thing , and to build the palace , for the which i have make provision .
and david say to all the congregation , now bless the lord you god .

and do eat and drink before the lord on that day with great gladness .
and they make solomon the son of david king the second time , and anoint he unto the lord to be the chief governor , and zadok to be priest .
then solomon sit on the throne of the lord as king instead of david he father , and prosper ; and all israel obey he .
and all the prince , and the mighty man , and all the son likewise of king david , submit themselves unto solomon the king .
and the lord magnify solomon exceedingly in the sight of all israel , and bestow upon he such royal majesty as have not be on any king before he in israel .
thus david the son of jesse reign over all israel .
and the time that he reign over israel be forty year ; seven year reign he in hebron , and thirty and three year reign he in jerusalem .
and he die in a good old age , full of day , riches , and honour : and solomon he son reign in he stead .
now the act of david the king , first and last , behold , they be write in the book of samuel the seer , and in the book of nathan the prophet , and in the book of gad the seer ,
with all he reign and he might , and the time that go over he , and over israel , and over all the kingdom of the country .
and solomon the son of david be strengthen in he kingdom , and the lord he god be with he , and magnify he exceedingly .
then solomon spake unto all israel , to the captain of thousand and of hundred , and to the judge , and to every governor in all israel , the chief of the father .
so solomon , and all the congregation with he , go to the high place that be at gibeon ; for there be the tabernacle of the congregation of god , which mose the servant of the lord have make in the wilderness .
but the ark of god have david bring up from kirjathjearim to the place which david have prepare for it : for he have pitch a tent for it at jerusalem .
moreover the brasen altar , that bezaleel the son of uri , the son of hur , have make , he put before the tabernacle of the lord : and solomon and the congregation seek unto it .
and solomon go up thither to the brasen altar before the lord , which be at the tabernacle of the congregation , and offer a thousand burnt offering upon it .
in that night do god appear unto solomon , and say unto he , ask what i shall give thee .
and solomon say unto god , thou hast shew great mercy unto david my father , and hast make i to reign in he stead .
now , o lord god , let thy promise unto david my father be establish : for thou hast make i king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
give i now wisdom and knowledge , that i may go out and come in before this people : for who can judge this thy people , that be so great ?
and god say to solomon , because this be in thine heart , and thou hast not ask riches , wealth , or honour , nor the life of thine enemy , neither yet hast ask long life ; but hast ask wisdom and knowledge for thyself , that thou mayest judge my people , over whom i have make thee king :
wisdom and knowledge be grant unto thee ; and i will give thee riches , and wealth , and honour , such as none of the king have have that have be before thee , neither shall there any after thee have the like .
then solomon come from he journey to the high place that be at gibeon to jerusalem , from before the tabernacle of the congregation , and reign over israel .

and solomon determine to build a house for the name of the lord , and a house for he kingdom .
and solomon tell out threescore and ten thousand man to bear burden , and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain , and three thousand and six hundred to oversee they .
and solomon send to huram the king of tyre , say , as thou didst deal with david my father , and didst send he cedar to build he a house to dwell therein , even so deal with i .
behold , i build a house to the name of the lord my god , to dedicate it to he , and to burn before he sweet incense , and for the continual shewbread , and for the burnt offering morning and evening , on the sabbath , and on the new moon , and on the solemn feast of the lord we god .
this be a ordinance for ever to israel .
and the house which i build be great : for great be we god above all god .
but who be able to build he a house , see the heaven and heaven of heaven can not contain he ? who be i then , that i should build he a house , save only to burn sacrifice before he ?
send i now therefore a man cunning to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass , and in iron , and in purple , and crimson , and blue , and that can skill to grave with the cunning man that be with i in judah and in jerusalem , whom david my father do provide .
send i also cedar tree , fir tree , and algum tree , out of lebanon : for i know that thy servant can skill to cut timber in lebanon ; and , behold , my servant shall be with thy servant ,
even to prepare i timber in abundance : for the house which i be about to build shall be wonderful great .
and , behold , i will give to thy servant , the hewer that cut timber , twenty thousand measure of beaten wheat , and twenty thousand measure of barley , and twenty thousand bath of wine , and twenty thousand bath of oil .
then huram the king of tyre answer in write , which he send to solomon , because the lord have love he people , he have make thee king over they .
huram say moreover , blessed be the lord god of israel , that make heaven and earth , who have give to david the king a wise son , endue with prudence and understanding , that might build a house for the lord , and a house for he kingdom .

now therefore the wheat , and the barley , the oil , and the wine , which my lord have speak of , let he send unto he servant :
and we will cut wood out of lebanon , as much as thou shalt need : and we will bring it to thee in float by sea to joppa ; and thou shalt carry it up to jerusalem .
and solomon number all the stranger that be in the land of israel , after the numbering wherewith david he father have number they ; and they be find a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
and he set threescore and ten thousand of they to be bearer of burden , and fourscore thousand to be hewer in the mountain , and three thousand and six hundred overseer to set the people a work .

and he rear up the pillar before the temple , one on the right hand , and the other on the leave ; and call the name of that on the right hand jachin , and the name of that on the left boaz .
moreover he make a altar of brass , twenty cubit the length thereof , and twenty cubit the breadth thereof , and ten cubit the height thereof .
also he make a molten sea of ten cubit from brim to brim , round in compass , and five cubit the height thereof ; and a line of thirty cubit do compass it round about .
and under it be the similitude of ox , which do compass it round about : ten in a cubit , compass the sea round about .
two row of ox be cast , when it be cast .
it stand upon twelve ox , three look toward the north , and three look toward the west , and three look toward the south , and three look toward the east : and the sea be set above upon they , and all they hinder part be inward .
and the thickness of it be a handbreadth , and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup , with flower of lily ; and it receive and hold three thousand bath .
he make also ten laver , and put five on the right hand , and five on the left , to wash in they : such thing as they offer for the burnt offering they wash in they ; but the sea be for the priest to wash in .
and he make ten candlestick of gold accord to they form , and set they in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he make also ten table , and place they in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left .
and he make a hundred bason of gold .
furthermore he make the court of the priest , and the great court , and door for the court , and overlay the door of they with brass .
and he set the sea on the right side of the east end , over against the south .
and huram make the pot , and the shovel , and the bason .
and huram finish the work that he be to make for king solomon for the house of god ;
to wit , the two pillar , and the pommel , and the chapiter which be on the top of the two pillar , and the two wreath to cover the two pommel of the chapiter which be on the top of the pillar ;
and four hundred pomegranate on the two wreath ; two row of pomegranate on each wreath , to cover the two pommel of the chapiter which be upon the pillar .
he make also basis , and laver make he upon the basis ;

the pot also , and the shovel , and the fleshhook , and all they instrument , do huram he father make to king solomon for the house of the lord of bright brass .
in the plain of jordan do the king cast they , in the clay ground between succoth and zeredathah .
thus solomon make all these vessel in great abundance : for the weight of the brass could not be find out .
and solomon make all the vessel that be for the house of god , the golden altar also , and the table whereon the shewbread be set ;
moreover the candlestick with they lamp , that they should burn after the manner before the oracle , of pure gold ;
and the flower , and the lamp , and the tong , make he of gold , and that perfect gold ;
and the snuffer , and the bason , and the spoon , and the censer , of pure gold : and the entry of the house , the inner door thereof for the most holy place , and the door of the house of the temple , be of gold .
thus all the work that solomon make for the house of the lord be finish : and solomon bring in all the thing that david he father have dedicate ; and the silver , and the gold , and all the instrument , put he among the treasure of the house of god .
then solomon assemble the elder of israel , and all the head of the tribe , the chief of the father of the child of israel , unto jerusalem , to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david , which be zion .
wherefore all the man of israel assemble themselves unto the king in the feast which be in the seventh month .
and all the elder of israel come ; and the levites take up the ark .
and they bring up the ark , and the tabernacle of the congregation , and all the holy vessel that be in the tabernacle , these do the priest and the levites bring up .
also king solomon , and all the congregation of israel that be assemble unto he before the ark , sacrifice sheep and ox , which could not be tell nor number for multitude .
and the priest bring in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto he place , to the oracle of the house , into the most holy place , even under the wing of the cherubim :
for the cherubim spread forth they wing over the place of the ark , and the cherubim cover the ark and the stave thereof above .
and they draw out the stave of the ark , that the end of the stave be see from the ark before the oracle ; but they be not see without .
and there it be unto this day .
there be nothing in the ark save the two table which moses put therein at horeb , when the lord make a covenant with the child of israel , when they come out of egypt .
and it come to pass , when the priest be come out of the holy place : ( for all the priest that be present be sanctify , and do not then wait by course :
also the levites which be the singer , all of they of asaph , of heman , of jeduthun , with they son and they brethren , be array in white linen , have cymbal and psaltery and harp , stand at the east end of the altar , and with they a hundred and twenty priest sound with trumpet : )
it come even to pass , as the trumpeter and singer be as one , to make one sound to be hear in praise and thank the lord ; and when they lift up they voice with the trumpet and cymbal and instrument of musick , and praise the lord , say , for he be good ; for he mercy endureth for ever : that then the house be fill with a cloud , even the house of the lord ;
so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud : for the glory of the lord have fill the house of god .
then say solomon , the lord have say that he would dwell in the thick darkness .
but i have build a house of habitation for thee , and a place for thy dwelling for ever .
and the king turn he face , and bless the whole congregation of israel : and all the congregation of israel stand .
and he say , blessed be the lord god of israel , who have with he hand fulfil that which he speak with he mouth to my father david , say ,
since the day that i bring forth my people out of the land of egypt i choose no city among all the tribe of israel to build a house in , that my name might be there ; neither choose i any man to be a ruler over my people israel :
but i have choose jerusalem , that my name might be there ; and have choose david to be over my people israel .
now it be in the heart of david my father to build a house for the name of the lord god of israel .
but the lord say to david my father , forasmuch as it be in thine heart to build a house for my name , thou didst well in that it be in thine heart :
notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loin , he shall build the house for my name .
the lord therefore have perform he word that he have speak : for i be rise up in the room of david my father , and be set on the throne of israel , as the lord promise , and have build the house for the name of the lord god of israel .
and in it have i put the ark , wherein be the covenant of the lord , that he make with the child of israel .
and he stand before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel , and spread forth he hand :
for solomon have make a brasen scaffold of five cubit long , and five cubit broad , and three cubit high , and have set it in the midst of the court : and upon it he stand , and kneel down upon he knee before all the congregation of israel , and spread forth he hand toward heaven ,
and say , o lord god of israel , there be no god like thee in the heaven , nor in the earth ; which keepest covenant , and shewest mercy unto thy servant , that walk before thee with all they heart :
thou which hast keep with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promise he ; and spakest with thy mouth , and hast fulfil it with thine hand , as it be this day .
now therefore , o lord god of israel , keep with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promise he , say , there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of israel ; yet so that thy child take heed to they way to walk in my law , as thou hast walk before i .
now then , o lord god of israel , let thy word be verify , which thou hast speak unto thy servant david .
but will god in very deed dwell with man on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heaven can not contain thee ; how much less this house which i have build !
have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant , and to he supplication , o lord my god , to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee :
that thine eye may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place whereof thou hast say that thou wouldest put thy name there ; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place .
hearken therefore unto the supplication of thy servant , and of thy people israel , which they shall make toward this place : hear thou from thy dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when thou hearest , forgive .
if a man sin against he neighbour , and a oath be lay upon he to make he swear , and the oath come before thine altar in this house ;
then hear thou from heaven , and do , and judge thy servant , by requite the wicked , by recompense he way upon he own head ; and by justify the righteous , by give he accord to he righteousness .
and if thy people israel be put to the worse before the enemy , because they have sin against thee ; and shall return and confess thy name , and pray and make supplication before thee in this house ;
then hear thou from the heaven , and forgive the sin of thy people israel , and bring they again unto the land which thou gavest to they and to they father .
when the heaven be shut up , and there be no rain , because they have sin against thee ; yet if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from they sin , when thou dost afflict they ;
then hear thou from heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servant , and of thy people israel , when thou hast teach they the good way , wherein they should walk ; and send rain upon thy land , which thou hast give unto thy people for a inheritance .
if there be dearth in the land , if there be pestilence , if there be blast , or mildew , locust , or caterpiller ; if they enemy besiege they in the city of they land ; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be :
then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be make of any man , or of all thy people israel , when every one shall know he own sore and he own grief , and shall spread forth he hand in this house :
then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and render unto every man accord unto all he way , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou only knowest the heart of the child of man : )
that they may fear thee , to walk in thy way , so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto we father .
moreover concern the stranger , which be not of thy people israel , but be come from a far country for thy great name 's sake , and thy mighty hand , and thy stretch out arm ; if they come and pray in this house ;
then hear thou from the heaven , even from thy dwelling place , and do accord to all that the stranger calleth to thee for ; that all people of the earth may know thy name , and fear thee , as doth thy people israel , and may know that this house which i have build be call by thy name .
if thy people go out to war against they enemy by the way that thou shalt send they , and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast choose , and the house which i have build for thy name ;
then hear thou from the heaven they prayer and they supplication , and maintain they cause .
if they sin against thee , ( for there be no man which sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with they , and deliver they over before they enemy , and they carry they away captive unto a land far off or near ;
yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they be carry captive , and turn and pray unto thee in the land of they captivity , say , we have sin , we have do amiss , and have deal wickedly ;
if they return to thee with all they heart and with all they soul in the land of they captivity , whither they have carry they captive , and pray toward they land , which thou gavest unto they father , and toward the city which thou hast choose , and toward the house which i have build for thy name :
then hear thou from the heaven , even from thy dwelling place , they prayer and they supplication , and maintain they cause , and forgive thy people which have sin against thee .
now , my god , let , i beseech thee , thine eye be open , and let thine ear be attent unto the prayer that be make in this place .
now therefore arise , o lord god , into thy rest place , thou , and the ark of thy strength : let thy priest , o lord god , be clothe with salvation , and let thy saint rejoice in goodness .
o lord god , turn not away the face of thine anointed : remember the mercy of david thy servant .
now when solomon have make a end of pray , the fire come down from heaven , and consume the burnt offering and the sacrifice ; and the glory of the lord fill the house .
and the priest could not enter into the house of the lord , because the glory of the lord have fill the lord 's house .
and when all the child of israel see how the fire come down , and the glory of the lord upon the house , they bow themselves with they face to the ground upon the pavement , and worship , and praise the lord , say , for he be good ; for he mercy endureth for ever .
then the king and all the people offer sacrifice before the lord .
and king solomon offer a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand ox , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep : so the king and all the people dedicate the house of god .
and the priest wait on they office : the levites also with instrument of musick of the lord , which david the king have make to praise the lord , because he mercy endureth for ever , when david praise by they ministry ; and the priest sound trumpet before they , and all israel stand .
moreover solomon hallowed the middle of the court that be before the house of the lord : for there he offer burnt offering , and the fat of the peace offering , because the brasen altar which solomon have make be not able to receive the burnt offering , and the meat offering , and the fat .
also at the same time solomon keep the feast seven day , and all israel with he , a very great congregation , from the enter in of hamath unto the river of egypt .
and in the eighth day they make a solemn assembly : for they keep the dedication of the altar seven day , and the feast seven day .
and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he send the people away into they tent , glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the lord have shew unto david , and to solomon , and to israel he people .
thus solomon finish the house of the lord , and the king 's house : and all that come into solomon 's heart to make in the house of the lord , and in he own house , he prosperously effect .
and the lord appear to solomon by night , and say unto he , i have hear thy prayer , and have choose this place to myself for a house of sacrifice .
if i shut up heaven that there be no rain , or if i command the locust to devour the land , or if i send pestilence among my people ;
if my people , which be call by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from they wicked way ; then will i hear from heaven , and will forgive they sin , and will heal they land .
now mine eye shall be open , and mine ear attent unto the prayer that be make in this place .
for now have i choose and sanctify this house , that my name may be there for ever : and mine eye and mine heart shall be there perpetually .
and as for thee , if thou wilt walk before i , as david thy father walk , and do accord to all that i have command thee , and shalt observe my statute and my judgment ;
then will i stablish the throne of thy kingdom , accord as i have covenant with david thy father , say , there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel .
but if ye turn away , and forsake my statute and my commandment , which i have set before you , and shall go and serve other god , and worship they ;
then will i pluck they up by the root out of my land which i have give they ; and this house , which i have sanctify for my name , will i cast out of my sight , and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nation .
and this house , which be high , shall be a astonishment to every one that passeth by it ; so that he shall say , why have the lord do thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
and it shall be answer , because they forsake the lord god of they father , which bring they forth out of the land of egypt , and lay hold on other god , and worship they , and serve they : therefore have he bring all this evil upon they .
and it come to pass at the end of twenty year , wherein solomon have build the house of the lord , and he own house ,
that the city which huram have restore to solomon , solomon build they , and cause the child of israel to dwell there .
and solomon go to hamathzobah , and prevail against it .
and he build tadmor in the wilderness , and all the store city , which he build in hamath .
also he build bethhoron the upper , and bethhoron the nether , fenced city , with wall , gate , and bar ;
and baalath , and all the store city that solomon have , and all the chariot city , and the city of the horseman , and all that solomon desire to build in jerusalem , and in lebanon , and throughout all the land of he dominion .
as for all the people that be leave of the hittites , and the amorites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , which be not of israel ,
but of they child , who be leave after they in the land , whom the child of israel consume not , they do solomon make to pay tribute until this day .
but of the child of israel do solomon make no servant for he work ; but they be man of war , and chief of he captain , and captain of he chariot and horseman .
and these be the chief of king solomon 's officer , even two hundred and fifty , that bare rule over the people .
and solomon bring up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of david unto the house that he have build for she : for he say , my wife shall not dwell in the house of david king of israel , because the place be holy , whereunto the ark of the lord have come .
then solomon offer burnt offering unto the lord on the altar of the lord , which he have build before the porch ,
even after a certain rate every day , offer accord to the commandment of moses , on the sabbath , and on the new moon , and on the solemn feast , three time in the year , even in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of week , and in the feast of tabernacle .
and he appoint , accord to the order of david he father , the course of the priest to they service , and the levites to they charge , to praise and minister before the priest , as the duty of every day require : the porter also by they course at every gate : for so have david the man of god command .
and they depart not from the commandment of the king unto the priest and levites concern any matter , or concern the treasure .
now all the work of solomon be prepare unto the day of the foundation of the house of the lord , and until it be finish .
so the house of the lord be perfect .
then go solomon to eziongeber , and to eloth , at the sea side in the land of edom .
and huram send he by the hand of he servant ship , and servant that have knowledge of the sea ; and they go with the servant of solomon to ophir , and take thence four hundred and fifty talent of gold , and bring they to king solomon .
and when the queen of sheba hear of the fame of solomon , she come to prove solomon with hard question at jerusalem , with a very great company , and camel that bare spice , and gold in abundance , and precious stone : and when she be come to solomon , she commune with he of all that be in she heart .
and solomon tell she all she question : and there be nothing hide from solomon which he tell she not .
and when the queen of sheba have see the wisdom of solomon , and the house that he have build ,
and the meat of he table , and the sit of he servant , and the attendance of he minister , and they apparel ; he cupbearer also , and they apparel ; and he ascent by which he go up into the house of the lord ; there be no more spirit in she .
and she say to the king , it be a true report which i hear in mine own land of thine act , and of thy wisdom :
howbeit i believe not they word , until i come , and mine eye have see it : and , behold , the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom be not tell i : for thou exceedest the fame that i hear .
happy be thy man , and happy be these thy servant , which stand continually before thee , and hear thy wisdom .
bless be the lord thy god , which delight in thee to set thee on he throne , to be king for the lord thy god : because thy god love israel , to establish they for ever , therefore make he thee king over they , to do judgment and justice .
and she give the king a hundred and twenty talent of gold , and of spice great abundance , and precious stone : neither be there any such spice as the queen of sheba give king solomon .
and the servant also of huram , and the servant of solomon , which bring gold from ophir , bring algum tree and precious stone .
and the king make of the algum tree terrace to the house of the lord , and to the king 's palace , and harp and psaltery for singer : and there be none such see before in the land of judah .
and king solomon give to the queen of sheba all she desire , whatsoever she ask , beside that which she have bring unto the king .
so she turn , and go away to she own land , she and she servant .
now the weight of gold that come to solomon in one year be six hundred and threescore and six talent of gold ;
beside that which chapman and merchant bring .
and all the king of arabia and governor of the country bring gold and silver to solomon .
and king solomon make two hundred target of beaten gold : six hundred shekel of beaten gold go to one target .
and three hundred shield make he of beat gold : three hundred shekel of gold go to one shield .
and the king put they in the house of the forest of lebanon .
moreover the king make a great throne of ivory , and overlay it with pure gold .
and there be six step to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which be fasten to the throne , and stay on each side of the sit place , and two lion stand by the stay :
and twelve lion stand there on the one side and on the other upon the six step .
there be not the like make in any kingdom .
and all the drinking vessel of king solomon be of gold , and all the vessel of the house of the forest of lebanon be of pure gold : none be of silver ; it be not any thing account of in the day of solomon .
for the king 's ship go to tarshish with the servant of huram : every three year once come the ship of tarshish bring gold , and silver , ivory , and ape , and peacock .
and king solomon pass all the king of the earth in riches and wisdom .
and all the king of the earth seek the presence of solomon , to hear he wisdom , that god have put in he heart .
and they bring every man he present , vessel of silver , and vessel of gold , and raiment , harness , and spice , horse , and mule , a rate year by year .
and solomon have four thousand stall for horse and chariot , and twelve thousand horseman ; whom he bestow in the chariot city , and with the king at jerusalem .
and he reign over all the king from the river even unto the land of the philistines , and to the border of egypt .
and the king make silver in jerusalem as stone , and cedar tree make he as the sycomore tree that be in the low plain in abundance .
and they bring unto solomon horse out of egypt , and out of all land .
now the rest of the act of solomon , first and last , be they not write in the book of nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite , and in the vision of iddo the seer against jeroboam the son of nebat ?
and solomon reign in jerusalem over all israel forty year .
and solomon sleep with he father , and he be bury in the city of david he father : and rehoboam he son reign in he stead .
and rehoboam go to shechem : for to shechem be all israel come to make he king .
and it come to pass , when jeroboam the son of nebat , who be in egypt , whither he have flee from the presence of solomon the king , hear it , that jeroboam return out of egypt .
and they send and call he .
so jeroboam and all israel come and speak to rehoboam , say ,
thy father make we yoke grievous : now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father , and he heavy yoke that he put upon we , and we will serve thee .
and he say unto they , come again unto i after three day .
and the people depart .
and king rehoboam take counsel with the old man that have stand before solomon he father while he yet live , say , what counsel give ye i to return answer to this people ?
and they speak unto he , say , if thou be kind to this people , and please they , and speak good word to they , they will be thy servant for ever .
but he forsake the counsel which the old man give he , and take counsel with the young man that be bring up with he , that stand before he .
and he say unto they , what advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have speak to i , say , ease somewhat the yoke that thy father do put upon we ?
and the young man that be bring up with he speak unto he , say , thus shalt thou answer the people that speak unto thee , say , thy father make we yoke heavy , but make thou it somewhat lighter for we ; thus shalt thou say unto they , my little finger shall be thicker than my father 's loin .
for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you , i will put more to you yoke : my father chastise you with whip , but i will chastise you with scorpion .
so jeroboam and all the people come to rehoboam on the third day , as the king bade , say , come again to i on the third day .
and the king answer they roughly ; and king rehoboam forsake the counsel of the old man ,
and answer they after the advice of the young man , say , my father make you yoke heavy , but i will add thereto : my father chastise you with whip , but i will chastise you with scorpion .
so the king hearken not unto the people : for the cause be of god , that the lord might perform he word , which he speak by the hand of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat .
and when all israel see that the king would not hearken unto they , the people answer the king , say , what portion have we in david ? and we have none inheritance in the son of jesse : every man to you tent , o israel : and now , david , see to thine own house .
so all israel go to they tent .
but as for the child of israel that dwell in the city of judah , rehoboam reign over they .
then king rehoboam send hadoram that be over the tribute ; and the child of israel stone he with stone , that he die .
but king rehoboam make speed to get he up to he chariot , to flee to jerusalem .
and israel rebel against the house of david unto this day .
and when rehoboam be come to jerusalem , he gather of the house of judah and benjamin a hundred and fourscore thousand choose man , which be warrior , to fight against israel , that he might bring the kingdom again to rehoboam .
but the word of the lord come to shemaiah the man of god , say ,
speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon , king of judah , and to all israel in judah and benjamin , say ,
thus saith the lord , ye shall not go up , nor fight against you brethren : return every man to he house : for this thing be do of i .
and they obey the word of the lord , and return from go against jeroboam .
and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem , and build city for defence in judah .
he build even bethlehem , and etam , and tekoa ,
and bethzur , and shoco , and adullam ,
and gath , and mareshah , and ziph ,
and adoraim , and lachish , and azekah ,
and zorah , and aijalon , and hebron , which be in judah and in benjamin fence city .
and he fortify the strong hold , and put captain in they , and store of victual , and of oil and wine .
and in every several city he put shield and spear , and make they exceed strong , have judah and benjamin on he side .
and the priest and the levites that be in all israel resort to he out of all they coast .
for the levites leave they suburb and they possession , and come to judah and jerusalem : for jeroboam and he son have cast they off from execute the priest 's office unto the lord :
and he ordain he priest for the high place , and for the devil , and for the calf which he have make .
and after they out of all the tribe of israel such as set they heart to seek the lord god of israel come to jerusalem , to sacrifice unto the lord god of they father .
so they strengthen the kingdom of judah , and make rehoboam the son of solomon strong , three year : for three year they walk in the way of david and solomon .
and rehoboam take he mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife , and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse ;
which bare he child ; jeush , and shamariah , and zaham .
and after she he take maachah the daughter of absalom ; which bare he abijah , and attai , and ziza , and shelomith .
and rehoboam love maachah the daughter of absalom above all he wife and he concubine : ( for he take eighteen wife , and threescore concubine ; and beget twenty and eight son , and threescore daughter . )
and rehoboam make abijah the son of maachah the chief , to be ruler among he brethren : for he think to make he king .
and he deal wisely , and disperse of all he child throughout all the country of judah and benjamin , unto every fenced city : and he give they victual in abundance .
and he desire many wife .
and it come to pass , when rehoboam have establish the kingdom , and have strengthen himself , he forsake the law of the lord , and all israel with he .
and it come to pass , that in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt come up against jerusalem , because they have transgress against the lord ,
with twelve hundred chariot , and threescore thousand horseman : and the people be without number that come with he out of egypt ; the lubims , the sukkiims , and the ethiopians .
and he take the fenced city which pertain to judah , and come to jerusalem .
then come shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam , and to the prince of judah , that be gather together to jerusalem because of shishak , and say unto they , thus saith the lord , ye have forsake i , and therefore have i also leave you in the hand of shishak .
whereupon the prince of israel and the king humble themselves ; and they say , the lord be righteous .
and when the lord see that they humble themselves , the word of the lord come to shemaiah , say , they have humble themselves ; therefore i will not destroy they , but i will grant they some deliverance ; and my wrath shall not be pour out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak .
nevertheless they shall be he servant ; that they may know my service , and the service of the kingdom of the country .
so shishak king of egypt come up against jerusalem , and take away the treasure of the house of the lord , and the treasure of the king 's house ; he take all : he carry away also the shield of gold which solomon have make .
instead of which king rehoboam make shield of brass , and commit they to the hand of the chief of the guard , that keep the entrance of the king 's house .
and when the king enter into the house of the lord , the guard come and fetch they , and bring they again into the guard chamber .
and when he humble himself , the wrath of the lord turn from he , that he would not destroy he altogether : and also in judah thing go well .
so king rehoboam strengthen himself in jerusalem , and reign : for rehoboam be one and forty year old when he begin to reign , and he reign seventeen year in jerusalem , the city which the lord have choose out of all the tribe of israel , to put he name there .
and he mother 's name be naamah a ammonitess .
and he do evil , because he prepare not he heart to seek the lord .
now the act of rehoboam , first and last , be they not write in the book of shemaiah the prophet , and of iddo the seer concern genealogy ?
and there be war between rehoboam and jeroboam continually .
and rehoboam sleep with he father , and be bury in the city of david : and abijah he son reign in he stead .
now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam begin abijah to reign over judah .
he reign three year in jerusalem .
he mother 's name also be michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah .
and there be war between abijah and jeroboam .
and abijah set the battle in array with a army of valiant man of war , even four hundred thousand choose man : jeroboam also set the battle in array against he with eight hundred thousand choose man , be mighty man of valour .
and abijah stand up upon mount zemaraim , which be in mount ephraim , and say , hear i , thou jeroboam , and all israel ;
ought ye not to know that the lord god of israel give the kingdom over israel to david for ever , even to he and to he son by a covenant of salt ?
yet jeroboam the son of nebat , the servant of solomon the son of david , be rise up , and have rebel against he lord .
and there be gather unto he vain man , the child of belial , and have strengthen themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon , when rehoboam be young and tenderhearted , and could not withstand they .
and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the son of david ; and ye be a great multitude , and there be with you golden calf , which jeroboam make you for god .
have ye not cast out the priest of the lord , the son of aaron , and the levites , and have make you priest after the manner of the nation of other land ? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven ram , the same may be a priest of they that be no god .
but as for we , the lord be we god , and we have not forsake he ; and the priest , which minister unto the lord , be the son of aaron , and the levites wait upon they business :
and they burn unto the lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifice and sweet incense : the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table ; and the candlestick of gold with the lamp thereof , to burn every evening : for we keep the charge of the lord we god ; but ye have forsake he .
and , behold , god himself be with we for we captain , and he priest with sound trumpet to cry alarm against you .
o child of israel , fight ye not against the lord god of you father ; for ye shall not prosper .
but jeroboam cause a ambushment to come about behind they : so they be before judah , and the ambushment be behind they .
and when judah look back , behold , the battle be before and behind : and they cry unto the lord , and the priest sound with the trumpet .
then the man of judah give a shout : and as the man of judah shout , it come to pass , that god smite jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah .
and the child of israel flee before judah : and god deliver they into they hand .
and abijah and he people slew they with a great slaughter : so there fall down slay of israel five hundred thousand choose man .
thus the child of israel be bring under at that time , and the child of judah prevail , because they rely upon the lord god of they father .
and abijah pursue after jeroboam , and take city from he , bethel with the town thereof , and jeshanah with the town thereof , and ephrain with the town thereof .
neither do jeroboam recover strength again in the day of abijah : and the lord strike he , and he die .
but abijah wax mighty , and married fourteen wife , and begat twenty and two son , and sixteen daughter .
and the rest of the act of abijah , and he way , and he saying , be write in the story of the prophet iddo .
so abijah sleep with he father , and they bury he in the city of david : and asa he son reign in he stead .
in he day the land be quiet ten year .
and asa do that which be good and right in the eye of the lord he god :
for he take away the altar of the strange god , and the high place , and brake down the image , and cut down the grove :
and command judah to seek the lord god of they father , and to do the law and the commandment .
also he take away out of all the city of judah the high place and the image : and the kingdom be quiet before he .
and he build fenced city in judah : for the land have rest , and he have no war in those year ; because the lord have give he rest .
therefore he say unto judah , let we build these city , and make about they wall , and tower , gate , and bar , while the land be yet before we ; because we have seek the lord we god , we have seek he , and he have give we rest on every side .
so they build and prosper .
and asa have a army of man that bare target and spear , out of judah three hundred thousand ; and out of benjamin , that bare shield and draw bow , two hundred and fourscore thousand : all these be mighty man of valour .
and there come out against they zerah the ethiopian with a host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred chariot ; and come unto mareshah .
then asa go out against he , and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah .
and asa cry unto the lord he god , and say , lord , it be nothing with thee to help , whether with many , or with they that have no power : help we , o lord we god ; for we rest on thee , and in thy name we go against this multitude .
o lord , thou art we god ; let not man prevail against thee .
so the lord smite the ethiopians before asa , and before judah ; and the ethiopians flee .
and asa and the people that be with he pursue they unto gerar : and the ethiopians be overthrow , that they could not recover themselves ; for they be destroy before the lord , and before he host ; and they carry away very much spoil .
and they smite all the city round about gerar ; for the fear of the lord come upon they : and they spoil all the city ; for there be exceed much spoil in they .
they smite also the tent of cattle , and carry away sheep and camel in abundance , and return to jerusalem .
and the spirit of god come upon azariah the son of oded :
and he go out to meet asa , and say unto he , hear ye i , asa , and all judah and benjamin ; the lord be with you , while ye be with he ; and if ye seek he , he will be find of you ; but if ye forsake he , he will forsake you .
now for a long season israel have be without the true god , and without a teaching priest , and without law .
but when they in they trouble do turn unto the lord god of israel , and seek he , he be find of they .
and in those time there be no peace to he that go out , nor to he that come in , but great vexation be upon all the inhabitant of the country .
and nation be destroy of nation , and city of city : for god do vex they with all adversity .
be ye strong therefore , and let not you hand be weak : for you work shall be reward .
and when asa hear these word , and the prophecy of oded the prophet , he take courage , and put away the abominable idol out of all the land of judah and benjamin , and out of the city which he have take from mount ephraim , and renew the altar of the lord , that be before the porch of the lord .
and he gather all judah and benjamin , and the stranger with they out of ephraim and manasseh , and out of simeon : for they fall to he out of israel in abundance , when they see that the lord he god be with he .
so they gather themselves together at jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa .
and they offer unto the lord the same time , of the spoil which they have bring , seven hundred ox and seven thousand sheep .
and they enter into a covenant to seek the lord god of they father with all they heart and with all they soul ;
that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
and they sware unto the lord with a loud voice , and with shout , and with trumpet , and with cornet .
and all judah rejoice at the oath : for they have swear with all they heart , and seek he with they whole desire ; and he be find of they : and the lord give they rest round about .
and also concern maachah the mother of asa the king , he remove she from be queen , because she have make a idol in a grove : and asa cut down she idol , and stamp it , and burn it at the brook kidron .
but the high place be not take away out of israel : nevertheless the heart of asa be perfect all he day .
and he bring into the house of god the thing that he father have dedicate , and that he himself have dedicate , silver , and gold , and vessel .
and there be no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa .
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel come up against judah , and build ramah , to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah .
then asa bring out silver and gold out of the treasure of the house of the lord and of the king 's house , and send to benhadad king of syria , that dwelt at damascus , say ,
there be a league between i and thee , as there be between my father and thy father : behold , i have send thee silver and gold ; go , break thy league with baasha king of israel , that he may depart from i .
and benhadad hearken unto king asa , and send the captain of he army against the city of israel ; and they smite ijon , and dan , and abelmaim , and all the store city of naphtali .
and it come to pass , when baasha hear it , that he leave off building of ramah , and let he work cease .
then asa the king take all judah ; and they carry away the stone of ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith baasha be build ; and he build therewith geba and mizpah .
and at that time hanani the seer come to asa king of judah , and say unto he , because thou hast rely on the king of syria , and not rely on the lord thy god , therefore be the host of the king of syria escape out of thine hand .
be not the ethiopians and the lubims a huge host , with very many chariot and horseman ? yet , because thou didst rely on the lord , he deliver they into thine hand .
for the eye of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth , to shew himself strong in the behalf of they whose heart be perfect toward he .
herein thou hast do foolishly : therefore from henceforth thou shalt have war .
then asa be wroth with the seer , and put he in a prison house ; for he be in a rage with he because of this thing .
and asa oppress some of the people the same time .
and , behold , the act of asa , first and last , lo , they be write in the book of the king of judah and israel .
and asa in the thirty and ninth year of he reign be diseased in he foot , until he disease be exceed great : yet in he disease he seek not to the lord , but to the physician .
and asa sleep with he father , and die in the one and fortieth year of he reign .
and they bury he in he own sepulchre , which he have make for himself in the city of david , and lay he in the bed which be fill with sweet odour and diver kind of spice prepare by the apothecary ' art : and they make a very great burning for he .
and jehoshaphat he son reign in he stead , and strengthen himself against israel .
and he place force in all the fenced city of judah , and set garrison in the land of judah , and in the city of ephraim , which asa he father have take .
and the lord be with jehoshaphat , because he walk in the first way of he father david , and seek not unto baalim ;
but seek to the lord god of he father , and walk in he commandment , and not after the doings of israel .
therefore the lord stablish the kingdom in he hand ; and all judah bring to jehoshaphat present ; and he have riches and honour in abundance .
and he heart be lift up in the way of the lord : moreover he take away the high place and grove out of judah .
also in the third year of he reign he send to he prince , even to benhail , and to obadiah , and to zechariah , and to nethaneel , and to michaiah , to teach in the city of judah .
and with they he send levites , even shemaiah , and nethaniah , and zebadiah , and asahel , and shemiramoth , and jehonathan , and adonijah , and tobijah , and tobadonijah , levites ; and with they elishama and jehoram , priest .
and they teach in judah , and have the book of the law of the lord with they , and go about throughout all the city of judah , and teach the people .
and the fear of the lord fall upon all the kingdom of the land that be round about judah , so that they make no war against jehoshaphat .
also some of the philistine bring jehoshaphat present , and tribute silver ; and the arabians bring he flock , seven thousand and seven hundred ram , and seven thousand and seven hundred he goat .
and jehoshaphat wax great exceedingly ; and he build in judah castle , and city of store .
and he have much business in the city of judah : and the man of war , mighty man of valour , be in jerusalem .
and these be the number of they accord to the house of they father : of judah , the captain of thousand ; adnah the chief , and with he mighty man of valour three hundred thousand .
and next to he be jehohanan the captain , and with he two hundred and fourscore thousand .
and next he be amasiah the son of zichri , who willingly offer himself unto the lord ; and with he two hundred thousand mighty man of valour .
and of benjamin ; eliada a mighty man of valour , and with he arm man with bow and shield two hundred thousand .
and next he be jehozabad , and with he a hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war .
these wait on the king , beside those whom the king put in the fenced city throughout all judah .
now jehoshaphat have riches and honour in abundance , and join affinity with ahab .
and after certain year he go down to ahab to samaria .
and ahab kill sheep and ox for he in abundance , and for the people that he have with he , and persuade he to go up with he to ramothgilead .
and ahab king of israel say unto jehoshaphat king of judah , wilt thou go with i to ramothgilead ?
and he answer he , i be as thou art , and my people as thy people ; and we will be with thee in the war .
and jehoshaphat say unto the king of israel , enquire , i pray thee , at the word of the lord to day .
therefore the king of israel gather together of prophet four hundred man , and say unto they , shall we go to ramothgilead to battle , or shall i forbear ?
and they say , go up ; for god will deliver it into the king 's hand .
but jehoshaphat say , be there not here a prophet of the lord besides , that we might enquire of he ?
and the king of israel say unto jehoshaphat , there be yet one man , by whom we may enquire of the lord : but i hate he ; for he never prophesy good unto i , but always evil : the same be micaiah the son of imlum .
and jehoshaphat say , let not the king say so .
and the king of israel call for one of he officer , and say , fetch quickly micaiah the son of imlum .
and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sit either of they on he throne , clothe in they robe , and they sit in a void place at the enter in of the gate of samaria ; and all the prophet prophesy before they .
and zedekiah the son of chenaanah have make he horn of iron , and say , thus saith the lord , with these thou shalt push syria until they be consume .
and all the prophet prophesy so , say , go up to ramothgilead , and prosper : for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
and the messenger that go to call micaiah spake to he , say , behold , the word of the prophet declare good to the king with one assent ; let thy word therefore , i pray thee , be like one of theirs , and speak thou good .
and micaiah say , as the lord liveth , even what my god saith , that will i speak .
and when he be come to the king , the king say unto he , micaiah , shall we go to ramothgilead to battle , or shall i forbear ?
and he say , go ye up , and prosper , and they shall be deliver into you hand .
and the king say to he , how many time shall i adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to i in the name of the lord ?
then he say , i do see all israel scatter upon the mountain , as sheep that have no shepherd : and the lord say , these have no master ; let they return therefore every man to he house in peace .
and the king of israel say to jehoshaphat , do i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto i , but evil ?
again he say , therefore hear the word of the lord ; i see the lord sit upon he throne , and all the host of heaven standing on he right hand and on he left .
and the lord say , who shall entice ahab king of israel , that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead ?
and one spake say after this manner , and another say after that manner .
then there come out a spirit , and stand before the lord , and say , i will entice he .
and the lord say unto he , wherewith ?
and he say , i will go out , and be a lie spirit in the mouth of all he prophet .
and the lord say , thou shalt entice he , and thou shalt also prevail : go out , and do even so .
now therefore , behold , the lord have put a lie spirit in the mouth of these thy prophet , and the lord have speak evil against thee .
then zedekiah the son of chenaanah come near , and smite micaiah upon the cheek , and say , which way go the spirit of the lord from i to speak unto thee ?
and micaiah say , behold , thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into a inner chamber to hide thyself .
then the king of israel say , take ye micaiah , and carry he back to amon the governor of the city , and to joash the king 's son ;
and say , thus saith the king , put this fellow in the prison , and feed he with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until i return in peace .
and micaiah say , if thou certainly return in peace , then have not the lord speak by i .
and he say , hearken , all ye people .
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah go up to ramothgilead .
and the king of israel say unto jehoshaphat , i will disguise myself , and will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robe .
so the king of israel disguise himself ; and they go to the battle .
now the king of syria have command the captain of the chariot that be with he , say , fight ye not with small or great , save only with the king of israel .
and it come to pass , when the captain of the chariot see jehoshaphat , that they say , it be the king of israel .
therefore they compass about he to fight : but jehoshaphat cry out , and the lord help he ; and god move they to depart from he .
for it come to pass , that , when the captain of the chariot perceive that it be not the king of israel , they turn back again from pursue he .
and a certain man draw a bow at a venture , and smite the king of israel between the joint of the harness : therefore he say to he chariot man , turn thine hand , that thou mayest carry i out of the host ; for i be wound .
and the battle increase that day : howbeit the king of israel stay himself up in he chariot against the syrians until the even : and about the time of the sun go down he die .
and jehoshaphat the king of judah return to he house in peace to jerusalem .
and jehu the son of hanani the seer go out to meet he , and say to king jehoshaphat , shouldest thou help the ungodly , and love they that hate the lord ? therefore be wrath upon thee from before the lord .
nevertheless there be good thing find in thee , in that thou hast take away the grove out of the land , and hast prepared thine heart to seek god .
and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem : and he go out again through the people from beersheba to mount ephraim , and bring they back unto the lord god of they father .
and he set judge in the land throughout all the fenced city of judah , city by city ,
and say to the judge , take heed what ye do : for ye judge not for man , but for the lord , who be with you in the judgment .
wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you ; take heed and do it : for there be no iniquity with the lord we god , nor respect of person , nor taking of gift .
moreover in jerusalem do jehoshaphat set of the levites , and of the priest , and of the chief of the father of israel , for the judgment of the lord , and for controversy , when they return to jerusalem .
and he charge they , say , thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord , faithfully , and with a perfect heart .
and what cause soever shall come to you of you brethren that dwell in they city , between blood and blood , between law and commandment , statute and judgment , ye shall even warn they that they trespass not against the lord , and so wrath come upon you , and upon you brethren : this do , and ye shall not trespass .
and , behold , amariah the chief priest be over you in all matter of the lord ; and zebadiah the son of ishmael , the ruler of the house of judah , for all the king 's matter : also the levites shall be officer before you .
deal courageously , and the lord shall be with the good .
it come to pass after this also , that the child of moab , and the child of ammon , and with they other beside the ammonites , come against jehoshaphat to battle .
then there come some that tell jehoshaphat , say , there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria ; and , behold , they be in hazazontamar , which be engedi .
and jehoshaphat fear , and set himself to seek the lord , and proclaim a fast throughout all judah .
and judah gather themselves together , to ask help of the lord : even out of all the city of judah they come to seek the lord .
and jehoshaphat stand in the congregation of judah and jerusalem , in the house of the lord , before the new court ,
and say , o lord god of we father , art not thou god in heaven ? and rulest not thou over all the kingdom of the heathen ? and in thine hand be there not power and might , so that none be able to withstand thee ?
art not thou we god , who do drive out the inhabitant of this land before thy people israel , and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend for ever ?
and they dwell therein , and have build thee a sanctuary therein for thy name , say ,
if , when evil cometh upon we , as the sword , judgment , or pestilence , or famine , we stand before this house , and in thy presence , ( for thy name be in this house , ) and cry unto thee in we affliction , then thou wilt hear and help .
and now , behold , the child of ammon and moab and mount seir , whom thou wouldest not let israel invade , when they come out of the land of egypt , but they turn from they , and destroy they not ;
behold , i say , how they reward we , to come to cast we out of thy possession , which thou hast give we to inherit .
o we god , wilt thou not judge they ? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against we ; neither know we what to do : but we eye be upon thee .
and all judah stand before the lord , with they little one , they wife , and they child .
then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah , the son of benaiah , the son of jeiel , the son of mattaniah , a levite of the son of asaph , come the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation ;
and he say , hearken ye , all judah , and ye inhabitant of jerusalem , and thou king jehoshaphat , thus saith the lord unto you , be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle be not yours , but god 's .
to morrow go ye down against they : behold , they come up by the cliff of ziz ; and ye shall find they at the end of the brook , before the wilderness of jeruel .
ye shall not need to fight in this battle : set yourselve , stand ye still , and see the salvation of the lord with you , o judah and jerusalem : fear not , nor be dismay ; to morrow go out against they : for the lord will be with you .
and jehoshaphat bow he head with he face to the ground : and all judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem fall before the lord , worship the lord .
and the levites , of the child of the kohathites , and of the child of the korhites , stand up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on high .
and they rise early in the morning , and go forth into the wilderness of tekoa : and as they go forth , jehoshaphat stand and say , hear i , o judah , and ye inhabitant of jerusalem ; believe in the lord you god , so shall ye be establish ; believe he prophet , so shall ye prosper .
and when he have consult with the people , he appoint singer unto the lord , and that should praise the beauty of holiness , as they go out before the army , and to say , praise the lord ; for he mercy endureth for ever .
and when they begin to sing and to praise , the lord set ambushment against the child of ammon , moab , and mount seir , which be come against judah ; and they be smitten .
for the child of ammon and moab stand up against the inhabitant of mount seir , utterly to slay and destroy they : and when they have make a end of the inhabitant of seir , every one help to destroy another .
and when judah come toward the watch tower in the wilderness , they look unto the multitude , and , behold , they be dead body fall to the earth , and none escape .
and when jehoshaphat and he people come to take away the spoil of they , they find among they in abundance both riches with the dead body , and precious jewel , which they strip off for themselves , more than they could carry away : and they be three day in gathering of the spoil , it be so much .
and on the fourth day they assemble themselves in the valley of berachah ; for there they bless the lord : therefore the name of the same place be call , the valley of berachah , unto this day .
then they return , every man of judah and jerusalem , and jehoshaphat in the forefront of they , to go again to jerusalem with joy ; for the lord have make they to rejoice over they enemy .
and they come to jerusalem with psaltery and harp and trumpet unto the house of the lord .
and the fear of god be on all the kingdom of those country , when they have hear that the lord fight against the enemy of israel .
so the realm of jehoshaphat be quiet : for he god give he rest round about .
and jehoshaphat reign over judah : he be thirty and five year old when he begin to reign , and he reign twenty and five year in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be azubah the daughter of shilhi .
and he walk in the way of asa he father , and depart not from it , do that which be right in the sight of the lord .
howbeit the high place be not take away : for as yet the people have not prepare they heart unto the god of they father .
now the rest of the act of jehoshaphat , first and last , behold , they be write in the book of jehu the son of hanani , who be mention in the book of the king of israel .
and after this do jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel , who do very wickedly :
and he join himself with he to make ship to go to tarshish : and they make the ship in eziongaber .
then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesy against jehoshaphat , say , because thou hast join thyself with ahaziah , the lord have broken thy work .
and the ship be break , that they be not able to go to tarshish .
now jehoshaphat sleep with he father , and be bury with he father in the city of david .
and jehoram he son reign in he stead .
and he have brethren the son of jehoshaphat , azariah , and jehiel , and zechariah , and azariah , and michael , and shephatiah : all these be the son of jehoshaphat king of israel .
and they father give they great gift of silver , and of gold , and of precious thing , with fenced city in judah : but the kingdom give he to jehoram ; because he be the firstborn .
now when jehoram be rise up to the kingdom of he father , he strengthen himself , and slew all he brethren with the sword , and diver also of the prince of israel .
jehoram be thirty and two year old when he begin to reign , and he reign eight year in jerusalem .
and he walk in the way of the king of israel , like as do the house of ahab : for he have the daughter of ahab to wife : and he work that which be evil in the eye of the lord .
howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david , because of the covenant that he have make with david , and as he promise to give a light to he and to he son for ever .
in he day the edomites revolt from under the dominion of judah , and make themselves a king .
then jehoram go forth with he prince , and all he chariot with he : and he rise up by night , and smite the edomites which compass he in , and the captain of the chariot .
so the edomites revolt from under the hand of judah unto this day .
the same time also do libnah revolt from under he hand ; because he have forsake the lord god of he father .
moreover he make high place in the mountain of judah , and cause the inhabitant of jerusalem to commit fornication , and compel judah thereto .
and there come a write to he from elijah the prophet , say , thus saith the lord god of david thy father , because thou hast not walk in the way of jehoshaphat thy father , nor in the way of asa king of judah ,
but hast walk in the way of the king of israel , and hast make judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem to go a whoring , like to the whoredom of the house of ahab , and also hast slay thy brethren of thy father 's house , which be better than thyself :
behold , with a great plague will the lord smite thy people , and thy child , and thy wife , and all thy goods :
and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels , until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day .
moreover the lord stir up against jehoram the spirit of the philistines , and of the arabians , that be near the ethiopians :
and they come up into judah , and brake into it , and carry away all the substance that be find in the king 's house , and he son also , and he wife ; so that there be never a son leave he , save jehoahaz , the youngest of he son .
and after all this the lord smite he in he bowels with a incurable disease .
and it come to pass , that in process of time , after the end of two year , he bowels fall out by reason of he sickness : so he die of sore disease .
and he people make no burning for he , like the burning of he father .
thirty and two year old be he when he begin to reign , and he reign in jerusalem eight year , and depart without be desire .
howbeit they bury he in the city of david , but not in the sepulchre of the king .
and the inhabitant of jerusalem make ahaziah he youngest son king in he stead : for the band of man that come with the arabians to the camp have slay all the eldest .
so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reign .
forty and two year old be ahaziah when he begin to reign , and he reign one year in jerusalem .
he mother 's name also be athaliah the daughter of omri .
he also walk in the way of the house of ahab : for he mother be he counsellor to do wickedly .
wherefore he do evil in the sight of the lord like the house of ahab : for they be he counsellor after the death of he father to he destruction .
he walk also after they counsel , and go with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead : and the syrians smite joram .
and he return to be heal in jezreel because of the wound which be give he at ramah , when he fight with hazael king of syria .
and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah go down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel , because he be sick .
and the destruction of ahaziah be of god by come to joram : for when he be come , he go out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi , whom the lord have anoint to cut off the house of ahab .
and it come to pass , that , when jehu be execute judgment upon the house of ahab , and find the prince of judah , and the son of the brethren of ahaziah , that minister to ahaziah , he slew they .
and he seek ahaziah : and they catch he , ( for he be hide in samaria , ) and bring he to jehu : and when they have slay he , they bury he : because , say they , he be the son of jehoshaphat , who seek the lord with all he heart .
so the house of ahaziah have no power to keep still the kingdom .
but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah see that she son be dead , she arise and destroy all the seed royal of the house of judah .
but jehoshabeath , the daughter of the king , take joash the son of ahaziah , and steal he from among the king 's son that be slay , and put he and he nurse in a bedchamber .
so jehoshabeath , the daughter of king jehoram , the wife of jehoiada the priest , ( for she be the sister of ahaziah , ) hide he from athaliah , so that she slew he not .
and he be with they hide in the house of god six year : and athaliah reign over the land .
and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthen himself , and take the captain of hundred , azariah the son of jeroham , and ishmael the son of jehohanan , and azariah the son of obed , and maaseiah the son of adaiah , and elishaphat the son of zichri , into covenant with he .
and they go about in judah , and gather the levites out of all the city of judah , and the chief of the father of israel , and they come to jerusalem .
and all the congregation make a covenant with the king in the house of god .
and he say unto they , behold , the king 's son shall reign , as the lord have say of the son of david .
this be the thing that ye shall do ; a third part of you enter on the sabbath , of the priest and of the levites , shall be porter of the door ;
and a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation : and all the people shall be in the court of the house of the lord .
but let none come into the house of the lord , save the priest , and they that minister of the levites ; they shall go in , for they be holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord .
and the levites shall compass the king round about , every man with he weapon in he hand ; and whosoever else cometh into the house , he shall be put to death : but be ye with the king when he cometh in , and when he goeth out .
so the levites and all judah do accord to all thing that jehoiada the priest have command , and take every man he man that be to come in on the sabbath , with they that be to go out on the sabbath : for jehoiada the priest dismiss not the course .
moreover jehoiada the priest deliver to the captain of hundred spear , and buckler , and shield , that have be king david 's , which be in the house of god .
and he set all the people , every man have he weapon in he hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
then they bring out the king 's son , and put upon he the crown , and give he the testimony , and make he king .
and jehoiada and he son anoint he , and say , god save the king .
now when athaliah hear the noise of the people run and praise the king , she come to the people into the house of the lord :
and she look , and , behold , the king stand at he pillar at the enter in , and the prince and the trumpet by the king : and all the people of the land rejoice , and sound with trumpet , also the singer with instrument of musick , and such as teach to sing praise .
then athaliah rent she clothes , and say , treason , treason .
then jehoiada the priest bring out the captain of hundred that be set over the host , and say unto they , have she forth of the range : and whoso followeth she , let he be slay with the sword .
for the priest say , slay she not in the house of the lord .
so they lay hand on she ; and when she be come to the enter of the horse gate by the king 's house , they slew she there .
and jehoiada make a covenant between he , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the lord 's people .
then all the people go to the house of baal , and brake it down , and brake he altar and he image in piece , and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altar .
also jehoiada appoint the office of the house of the lord by the hand of the priest the levites , whom david have distribute in the house of the lord , to offer the burnt offering of the lord , as it be write in the law of moses , with rejoice and with singing , as it be ordain by david .
and he set the porter at the gate of the house of the lord , that none which be unclean in any thing should enter in .
and he take the captain of hundred , and the noble , and the governor of the people , and all the people of the land , and bring down the king from the house of the lord : and they come through the high gate into the king 's house , and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom .
and all the people of the land rejoice : and the city be quiet , after that they have slay athaliah with the sword .
joash be seven year old when he begin to reign , and he reign forty year in jerusalem .
he mother 's name also be zibiah of beersheba .
and joash do that which be right in the sight of the lord all the day of jehoiada the priest .
and jehoiada take for he two wife ; and he beget son and daughter .
and it come to pass after this , that joash be mind to repair the house of the lord .
and he gather together the priest and the levites , and say to they , go out unto the city of judah , and gather of all israel money to repair the house of you god from year to year , and see that ye hasten the matter .
howbeit the levites hasten it not .
and the king call for jehoiada the chief , and say unto he , why hast thou not require of the levites to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the collection , accord to the commandment of moses the servant of the lord , and of the congregation of israel , for the tabernacle of witness ?
for the son of athaliah , that wicked woman , have break up the house of god ; and also all the dedicated thing of the house of the lord do they bestow upon baalim .
and at the king 's commandment they make a chest , and set it without at the gate of the house of the lord .
and they make a proclamation through judah and jerusalem , to bring in to the lord the collection that mose the servant of god lay upon israel in the wilderness .
and all the prince and all the people rejoice , and bring in , and cast into the chest , until they have make a end .
now it come to pass , that at what time the chest be bring unto the king 's office by the hand of the levites , and when they see that there be much money , the king 's scribe and the high priest 's officer come and empty the chest , and take it , and carry it to he place again .
thus they do day by day , and gather money in abundance .
and the king and jehoiada give it to such as do the work of the service of the house of the lord , and hire mason and carpenter to repair the house of the lord , and also such as work iron and brass to mend the house of the lord .
so the workman work , and the work be perfect by they , and they set the house of god in he state , and strengthen it .
and when they have finish it , they bring the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada , whereof be make vessel for the house of the lord , even vessel to minister , and to offer withal , and spoon , and vessel of gold and silver .
and they offer burnt offering in the house of the lord continually all the day of jehoiada .
but jehoiada wax old , and be full of day when he die ; a hundred and thirty year old be he when he die .
and they bury he in the city of david among the king , because he have do good in israel , both toward god , and toward he house .
now after the death of jehoiada come the prince of judah , and make obeisance to the king .
then the king hearken unto they .
and they leave the house of the lord god of they father , and serve grove and idol : and wrath come upon judah and jerusalem for this they trespass .
yet he send prophet to they , to bring they again unto the lord ; and they testify against they : but they would not give ear .
and the spirit of god come upon zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest , which stand above the people , and say unto they , thus saith god , why transgress ye the commandment of the lord , that ye can not prosper ? because ye have forsake the lord , he have also forsake you .
and they conspire against he , and stone he with stone at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord .
thus joash the king remember not the kindness which jehoiada he father have do to he , but slew he son .
and when he die , he say , the lord look upon it , and require it .
and it come to pass at the end of the year , that the host of syria come up against he : and they come to judah and jerusalem , and destroy all the prince of the people from among the people , and send all the spoil of they unto the king of damascus .
for the army of the syrians come with a small company of man , and the lord deliver a very great host into they hand , because they have forsake the lord god of they father .
so they execute judgment against joash .
and when they be depart from he , ( for they leave he in great disease , ) he own servant conspire against he for the blood of the son of jehoiada the priest , and slew he on he bed , and he die : and they bury he in the city of david , but they bury he not in the sepulchre of the king .
and these be they that conspire against he ; zabad the son of shimeath a ammonitess , and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess .
now concern he son , and the greatness of the burden lay upon he , and the repair of the house of god , behold , they be write in the story of the book of the king .
and amaziah he son reign in he stead .
amaziah be twenty and five year old when he begin to reign , and he reign twenty and nine year in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be jehoaddan of jerusalem .
and he do that which be right in the sight of the lord , but not with a perfect heart .
now it come to pass , when the kingdom be establish to he , that he slew he servant that have kill the king he father .
but he slew not they child , but do as it be write in the law in the book of moses , where the lord command , say , the father shall not die for the child , neither shall the child die for the father , but every man shall die for he own sin .
moreover amaziah gather judah together , and make they captain over thousand , and captain over hundred , accord to the house of they father , throughout all judah and benjamin : and he number they from twenty year old and above , and find they three hundred thousand choice man , able to go forth to war , that could handle spear and shield .
he hire also a hundred thousand mighty man of valour out of israel for a hundred talent of silver .
but there come a man of god to he , say , o king , let not the army of israel go with thee ; for the lord be not with israel , to wit , with all the child of ephraim .
but if thou wilt go , do it , be strong for the battle : god shall make thee fall before the enemy : for god have power to help , and to cast down .
and amaziah say to the man of god , but what shall we do for the hundred talent which i have give to the army of israel ?
and the man of god answer , the lord be able to give thee much more than this .
then amaziah separate they , to wit , the army that be come to he out of ephraim , to go home again : wherefore they anger be greatly kindle against judah , and they return home in great anger .
and amaziah strengthen himself , and lead forth he people , and go to the valley of salt , and smote of the child of seir ten thousand .
and other ten thousand leave alive do the child of judah carry away captive , and bring they unto the top of the rock , and cast they down from the top of the rock , that they all be break in piece .
but the soldier of the army which amaziah send back , that they should not go with he to battle , fall upon the city of judah , from samaria even unto bethhoron , and smite three thousand of they , and take much spoil .
now it come to pass , after that amaziah be come from the slaughter of the edomites , that he bring the god of the child of seir , and set they up to be he god , and bow down himself before they , and burn incense unto they .
wherefore the anger of the lord be kindle against amaziah , and he send unto he a prophet , which say unto he , why hast thou seek after the god of the people , which could not deliver they own people out of thine hand ?
and it come to pass , as he talk with he , that the king say unto he , art thou make of the king 's counsel ? forbear ; why shouldest thou be smite ?
then the prophet forbare , and say , i know that god have determine to destroy thee , because thou hast do this , and hast not hearken unto my counsel .
then amaziah king of judah take advice , and send to joash , the son of jehoahaz , the son of jehu , king of israel , say , come , let we see one another in the face .
and joash king of israel send to amaziah king of judah , say , the thistle that be in lebanon send to the cedar that be in lebanon , say , give thy daughter to my son to wife : and there pass by a wild beast that be in lebanon , and trode down the thistle .
thou sayest , lo , thou hast smite the edomites ; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast : abide now at home ; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and judah with thee ?
but amaziah would not hear ; for it come of god , that he might deliver they into the hand of they enemy , because they seek after the god of edom .
so joash the king of israel go up ; and they see one another in the face , both he and amaziah king of judah , at bethshemesh , which belongeth to judah .
and judah be put to the worse before israel , and they flee every man to he tent .
and joash the king of israel take amaziah king of judah , the son of joash , the son of jehoahaz , at bethshemesh , and bring he to jerusalem , and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubit .
and he take all the gold and the silver , and all the vessel that be find in the house of god with obededom , and the treasure of the king 's house , the hostage also , and return to samaria .
and amaziah the son of joash king of judah live after the death of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen year .
now the rest of the act of amaziah , first and last , behold , be they not write in the book of the king of judah and israel ?
now after the time that amaziah do turn away from follow the lord they make a conspiracy against he in jerusalem ; and he flee to lachish : but they send to lachish after he , and slew he there .
and they bring he upon horse , and bury he with he father in the city of judah .
then all the people of judah take uzziah , who be sixteen year old , and make he king in the room of he father amaziah .
he build eloth , and restore it to judah , after that the king sleep with he father .
sixteen year old be uzziah when he begin to reign , and he reign fifty and two year in jerusalem .
he mother 's name also be jecoliah of jerusalem .
and he do that which be right in the sight of the lord , accord to all that he father amaziah do .
and he seek god in the day of zechariah , who have understanding in the vision of god : and as long as he seek the lord , god make he to prosper .
and he go forth and war against the philistines , and brake down the wall of gath , and the wall of jabneh , and the wall of ashdod , and build city about ashdod , and among the philistines .
and god help he against the philistines , and against the arabians that dwell in gurbaal , and the mehunims .
and the ammonites give gift to uzziah : and he name spread abroad even to the enter in of egypt ; for he strengthen himself exceedingly .
moreover uzziah build tower in jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortify they .
also he build tower in the desert , and dig many well : for he have much cattle , both in the low country , and in the plain : husbandman also , and vine dresser in the mountain , and in carmel : for he love husbandry .
moreover uzziah have a host of fight man , that go out to war by band , accord to the number of they account by the hand of jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler , under the hand of hananiah , one of the king 's captain .
the whole number of the chief of the father of the mighty man of valour be two thousand and six hundred .
and under they hand be a army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , that make war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
and uzziah prepare for they throughout all the host shield , and spear , and helmet , and habergeon , and bow , and sling to cast stone .
and he make in jerusalem engine , invent by cunning man , to be on the tower and upon the bulwark , to shoot arrow and great stone withal .
and he name spread far abroad ; for he be marvellously help , till he be strong .
but when he be strong , he heart be lift up to he destruction : for he transgress against the lord he god , and go into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense .
and azariah the priest go in after he , and with he fourscore priest of the lord , that be valiant man :
and they withstand uzziah the king , and say unto he , it appertaineth not unto thee , uzziah , to burn incense unto the lord , but to the priest the son of aaron , that be consecrate to burn incense : go out of the sanctuary ; for thou hast trespass ; neither shall it be for thine honour from the lord god .
then uzziah be wroth , and have a censer in he hand to burn incense : and while he be wroth with the priest , the leprosy even rise up in he forehead before the priest in the house of the lord , from beside the incense altar .
and azariah the chief priest , and all the priest , look upon he , and , behold , he be leprous in he forehead , and they thrust he out from thence ; yea , himself hast also to go out , because the lord have smite he .
and uzziah the king be a leper unto the day of he death , and dwelt in a several house , be a leper ; for he be cut off from the house of the lord : and jotham he son be over the king 's house , judge the people of the land .
now the rest of the act of uzziah , first and last , do isaiah the prophet , the son of amoz , write .
so uzziah sleep with he father , and they bury he with he father in the field of the burial which belong to the king ; for they say , he be a leper : and jotham he son reign in he stead .
jotham be twenty and five year old when he begin to reign , and he reign sixteen year in jerusalem .
he mother 's name also be jerushah , the daughter of zadok .
and he do that which be right in the sight of the lord , accord to all that he father uzziah do : howbeit he enter not into the temple of the lord .
and the people do yet corruptly .
he build the high gate of the house of the lord , and on the wall of ophel he build much .
moreover he build city in the mountain of judah , and in the forest he build castle and tower .
he fight also with the king of the ammonites , and prevail against they .
and the child of ammon give he the same year a hundred talent of silver , and ten thousand measure of wheat , and ten thousand of barley .
so much do the child of ammon pay unto he , both the second year , and the third .
so jotham become mighty , because he prepare he way before the lord he god .
now the rest of the act of jotham , and all he war , and he way , lo , they be write in the book of the king of israel and judah .
he be five and twenty year old when he begin to reign , and reign sixteen year in jerusalem .
and jotham sleep with he father , and they bury he in the city of david : and ahaz he son reign in he stead .
ahaz be twenty year old when he begin to reign , and he reign sixteen year in jerusalem : but he do not that which be right in the sight of the lord , like david he father :
for he walk in the way of the king of israel , and make also molten image for baalim .
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom , and burn he child in the fire , after the abomination of the heathen whom the lord have cast out before the child of israel .
he sacrifice also and burnt incense in the high place , and on the hill , and under every green tree .
wherefore the lord he god deliver he into the hand of the king of syria ; and they smite he , and carry away a great multitude of they captive , and bring they to damascus .
and he be also deliver into the hand of the king of israel , who smite he with a great slaughter .
for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day , which be all valiant man ; because they have forsake the lord god of they father .
and zichri , a mighty man of ephraim , slew maaseiah the king 's son , and azrikam the governor of the house , and elkanah that be next to the king .
and the child of israel carry away captive of they brethren two hundred thousand , woman , son , and daughter , and take also away much spoil from they , and bring the spoil to samaria .
but a prophet of the lord be there , whose name be oded : and he go out before the host that come to samaria , and say unto they , behold , because the lord god of you father be wroth with judah , he have deliver they into you hand , and ye have slay they in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven .
and now ye purpose to keep under the child of judah and jerusalem for bondman and bondwoman unto you : but be there not with you , even with you , sin against the lord you god ?
now hear i therefore , and deliver the captive again , which ye have take captive of you brethren : for the fierce wrath of the lord be upon you .
then certain of the head of the child of ephraim , azariah the son of johanan , berechiah the son of meshillemoth , and jehizkiah the son of shallum , and amasa the son of hadlai , stand up against they that come from the war ,
and say unto they , ye shall not bring in the captive hither : for whereas we have offend against the lord already , ye intend to add more to we sin and to we trespass : for we trespass be great , and there be fierce wrath against israel .
so the armed man leave the captive and the spoil before the prince and all the congregation .
and the man which be express by name rise up , and take the captive , and with the spoil clothe all that be naked among they , and array they , and shoe they , and give they to eat and to drink , and anoint they , and carry all the feeble of they upon ass , and bring they to jericho , the city of palm tree , to they brethren : then they return to samaria .
at that time do king ahaz send unto the king of assyria to help he .
for again the edomites have come and smitten judah , and carry away captive .
the philistine also have invade the city of the low country , and of the south of judah , and have take bethshemesh , and ajalon , and gederoth , and shocho with the village thereof , and timnah with the village thereof , gimzo also and the village thereof : and they dwell there .
for the lord bring judah low because of ahaz king of israel ; for he make judah naked , and transgress sore against the lord .
and tilgathpilneser king of assyria come unto he , and distressed he , but strengthen he not .
for ahaz take away a portion out of the house of the lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the prince , and give it unto the king of assyria : but he help he not .
and in the time of he distress do he trespass yet more against the lord : this be that king ahaz .
for he sacrifice unto the god of damascus , which smite he : and he say , because the god of the king of syria help they , therefore will i sacrifice to they , that they may help i .
but they be the ruin of he , and of all israel .
and ahaz gather together the vessel of the house of god , and cut in piece the vessel of the house of god , and shut up the door of the house of the lord , and he make he altar in every corner of jerusalem .
and in every several city of judah he make high place to burn incense unto other god , and provoke to anger the lord god of he father .
now the rest of he act and of all he way , first and last , behold , they be write in the book of the king of judah and israel .
and ahaz sleep with he father , and they bury he in the city , even in jerusalem : but they bring he not into the sepulchre of the king of israel : and hezekiah he son reign in he stead .
hezekiah begin to reign when he be five and twenty year old , and he reign nine and twenty year in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be abijah , the daughter of zechariah .
and he do that which be right in the sight of the lord , accord to all that david he father have do .
he in the first year of he reign , in the first month , open the door of the house of the lord , and repair they .
and he bring in the priest and the levites , and gather they together into the east street ,
and say unto they , hear i , ye levites , sanctify now yourselve , and sanctify the house of the lord god of you father , and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place .
for we father have trespass , and do that which be evil in the eye of the lord we god , and have forsake he , and have turn away they face from the habitation of the lord , and turn they back .
also they have shut up the door of the porch , and put out the lamp , and have not burn incense nor offer burnt offering in the holy place unto the god of israel .
wherefore the wrath of the lord be upon judah and jerusalem , and he have deliver they to trouble , to astonishment , and to hiss , as ye see with you eye .
for , lo , we father have fall by the sword , and we son and we daughter and we wife be in captivity for this .
now it be in mine heart to make a covenant with the lord god of israel , that he fierce wrath may turn away from we .
my son , be not now negligent : for the lord have choose you to stand before he , to serve he , and that ye should minister unto he , and burn incense .
then the levites arise , mahath the son of amasai , and joel the son of azariah , of the son of the kohathites : and of the son of merari , kish the son of abdi , and azariah the son of jehalelel : and of the gershonites ; joah the son of zimmah , and eden the son of joah :
and of the son of elizaphan ; shimri , and jeiel : and of the son of asaph ; zechariah , and mattaniah :
and of the son of heman ; jehiel , and shimei : and of the son of jeduthun ; shemaiah , and uzziel .
and they gather they brethren , and sanctify themselves , and come , accord to the commandment of the king , by the word of the lord , to cleanse the house of the lord .
and the priest go into the inner part of the house of the lord , to cleanse it , and bring out all the uncleanness that they find in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the lord .
and the levites take it , to carry it out abroad into the brook kidron .
now they begin on the first day of the first month to sanctify , and on the eighth day of the month come they to the porch of the lord : so they sanctify the house of the lord in eight day ; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they make a end .
then they go in to hezekiah the king , and say , we have cleanse all the house of the lord , and the altar of burnt offering , with all the vessel thereof , and the shewbread table , with all the vessel thereof .
moreover all the vessel , which king ahaz in he reign do cast away in he transgression , have we prepare and sanctify , and , behold , they be before the altar of the lord .
then hezekiah the king rise early , and gather the ruler of the city , and go up to the house of the lord .
and they bring seven bullock , and seven ram , and seven lamb , and seven he goat , for a sin offering for the kingdom , and for the sanctuary , and for judah .
and he command the priest the son of aaron to offer they on the altar of the lord .
so they kill the bullock , and the priest receive the blood , and sprinkle it on the altar : likewise , when they have kill the ram , they sprinkle the blood upon the altar : they kill also the lamb , and they sprinkle the blood upon the altar .
and they bring forth the he goat for the sin offering before the king and the congregation ; and they lay they hand upon they :
and the priest kill they , and they make reconciliation with they blood upon the altar , to make a atonement for all israel : for the king command that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be make for all israel .
and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbal , with psaltery , and with harp , accord to the commandment of david , and of gad the king 's seer , and nathan the prophet : for so be the commandment of the lord by he prophet .
and the levites stand with the instrument of david , and the priest with the trumpet .
and hezekiah command to offer the burnt offering upon the altar .
and when the burnt offering begin , the song of the lord begin also with the trumpet , and with the instrument ordain by david king of israel .
and all the congregation worship , and the singer sing , and the trumpeter sound : and all this continue until the burnt offering be finish .
and when they have make a end of offering , the king and all that be present with he bow themselves , and worship .
moreover hezekiah the king and the prince command the levites to sing praise unto the lord with the word of david , and of asaph the seer .
and they sing praise with gladness , and they bow they head and worship .
then hezekiah answer and say , now ye have consecrate yourselve unto the lord , come near and bring sacrifice and thank offering into the house of the lord .
and the congregation bring in sacrifice and thank offering ; and as many as be of a free heart burnt offering .
and the number of the burnt offering , which the congregation bring , be threescore and ten bullock , a hundred ram , and two hundred lamb : all these be for a burnt offering to the lord .
and the consecrate thing be six hundred ox and three thousand sheep .
but the priest be too few , so that they could not flay all the burnt offering : wherefore they brethren the levites do help they , till the work be end , and until the other priest have sanctify themselves : for the levites be more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priest .
and also the burnt offering be in abundance , with the fat of the peace offering , and the drink offering for every burnt offering .
so the service of the house of the lord be set in order .
and hezekiah rejoice , and all the people , that god have prepare the people : for the thing be do suddenly .
and hezekiah send to all israel and judah , and write letter also to ephraim and manasseh , that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem , to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel .
for the king have take counsel , and he prince , and all the congregation in jerusalem , to keep the passover in the second month .
for they could not keep it at that time , because the priest have not sanctify themselves sufficiently , neither have the people gather themselves together to jerusalem .
and the thing please the king and all the congregation .
so they establish a decree to make proclamation throughout all israel , from beersheba even to dan , that they should come to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem : for they have not do it of a long time in such sort as it be write .
so the post go with the letter from the king and he prince throughout all israel and judah , and accord to the commandment of the king , say , ye child of israel , turn again unto the lord god of abraham , isaac , and israel , and he will return to the remnant of you , that be escape out of the hand of the king of assyria .
and be not ye like you father , and like you brethren , which trespass against the lord god of they father , who therefore give they up to desolation , as ye see .
now be ye not stiffneck , as you father be , but yield yourselve unto the lord , and enter into he sanctuary , which he have sanctify for ever : and serve the lord you god , that the fierceness of he wrath may turn away from you .
for if ye turn again unto the lord , you brethren and you child shall find compassion before they that lead they captive , so that they shall come again into this land : for the lord you god be gracious and merciful , and will not turn away he face from you , if ye return unto he .
so the post pass from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun : but they laugh they to scorn , and mock they .
nevertheless diver of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humble themselves , and come to jerusalem .
also in judah the hand of god be to give they one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the prince , by the word of the lord .
and there assemble at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month , a very great congregation .
and they arise and take away the altar that be in jerusalem , and all the altar for incense take they away , and cast they into the brook kidron .
then they kill the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priest and the levites be ashamed , and sanctify themselves , and bring in the burnt offering into the house of the lord .
and they stand in they place after they manner , accord to the law of moses the man of god : the priest sprinkle the blood , which they receive of the hand of the levites .
for there be many in the congregation that be not sanctify : therefore the levites have the charge of the killing of the passover for every one that be not clean , to sanctify they unto the lord .
for a multitude of the people , even many of ephraim , and manasseh , issachar , and zebulun , have not cleanse themselves , yet do they eat the passover otherwise than it be write .
but hezekiah pray for they , say , the good lord pardon every one
that prepareth he heart to seek god , the lord god of he father , though he be not cleansed accord to the purification of the sanctuary .
and the lord hearken to hezekiah , and heal the people .
and the child of israel that be present at jerusalem keep the feast of unleavened bread seven day with great gladness : and the levites and the priest praise the lord day by day , singing with loud instrument unto the lord .
and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that teach the good knowledge of the lord : and they do eat throughout the feast seven day , offer peace offering , and make confession to the lord god of they father .
and the whole assembly take counsel to keep other seven day : and they keep other seven day with gladness .
for hezekiah king of judah do give to the congregation a thousand bullock and seven thousand sheep ; and the prince give to the congregation a thousand bullock and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priest sanctify themselves .
and all the congregation of judah , with the priest and the levites , and all the congregation that come out of israel , and the stranger that come out of the land of israel , and that dwelt in judah , rejoice .
so there be great joy in jerusalem : for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel there be not the like in jerusalem .
then the priest the levites arise and bless the people : and they voice be hear , and they prayer come up to he holy dwelling place , even unto heaven .
now when all this be finish , all israel that be present go out to the city of judah , and brake the image in piece , and cut down the grove , and throw down the high place and the altar out of all judah and benjamin , in ephraim also and manasseh , until they have utterly destroy they all .
then all the child of israel return , every man to he possession , into they own city .
and hezekiah appoint the course of the priest and the levites after they course , every man accord to he service , the priest and levites for burnt offering and for peace offering , to minister , and to give thanks , and to praise in the gate of the tent of the lord .
he appoint also the king 's portion of he substance for the burnt offering , to wit , for the morning and evening burnt offering , and the burnt offering for the sabbath , and for the new moon , and for the set feast , as it be write in the law of the lord .
moreover he command the people that dwell in jerusalem to give the portion of the priest and the levites , that they might be encourage in the law of the lord .
and as soon as the commandment come abroad , the child of israel bring in abundance the firstfruit of corn , wine , and oil , and honey , and of all the increase of the field ; and the tithe of all thing bring they in abundantly .
and concern the child of israel and judah , that dwelt in the city of judah , they also bring in the tithe of ox and sheep , and the tithe of holy thing which be consecrate unto the lord they god , and lay they by heap .
in the third month they begin to lay the foundation of the heap , and finish they in the seventh month .
and when hezekiah and the prince come and see the heap , they bless the lord , and he people israel .
then hezekiah question with the priest and the levites concern the heap .
and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answer he , and say , since the people begin to bring the offering into the house of the lord , we have have enough to eat , and have leave plenty : for the lord have bless he people ; and that which be leave be this great store .
then hezekiah command to prepare chamber in the house of the lord ; and they prepare they ,
and bring in the offering and the tithe and the dedicated thing faithfully : over which cononiah the levite be ruler , and shimei he brother be the next .
and jehiel , and azaziah , and nahath , and asahel , and jerimoth , and jozabad , and eliel , and ismachiah , and mahath , and benaiah , be overseer under the hand of cononiah and shimei he brother , at the commandment of hezekiah the king , and azariah the ruler of the house of god .
and kore the son of imnah the levite , the porter toward the east , be over the freewill offering of god , to distribute the oblation of the lord , and the most holy thing .
and next he be eden , and miniamin , and jeshua , and shemaiah , amariah , and shecaniah , in the city of the priest , in they set office , to give to they brethren by course , as well to the great as to the small :
beside they genealogy of male , from three year old and upward , even unto every one that entereth into the house of the lord , he daily portion for they service in they charge accord to they course ;
both to the genealogy of the priest by the house of they father , and the levites from twenty year old and upward , in they charge by they course ;
and to the genealogy of all they little one , they wife , and they son , and they daughter , through all the congregation : for in they set office they sanctify themselves in holiness :
also of the son of aaron the priest , which be in the field of the suburb of they city , in every several city , the man that be express by name , to give portion to all the male among the priest , and to all that be reckon by genealogy among the levites .
and thus do hezekiah throughout all judah , and work that which be good and right and truth before the lord he god .
and in every work that he begin in the service of the house of god , and in the law , and in the commandment , to seek he god , he do it with all he heart , and prosper .
after these thing , and the establishment thereof , sennacherib king of assyria come , and enter into judah , and encamp against the fenced city , and think to win they for himself .
and when hezekiah see that sennacherib be come , and that he be purpose to fight against jerusalem ,
he take counsel with he prince and he mighty man to stop the water of the fountain which be without the city : and they do help he .
so there be gather much people together , who stop all the fountain , and the brook that run through the midst of the land , say , why should the king of assyria come , and find much water ?
also he strengthen himself , and build up all the wall that be break , and raise it up to the tower , and another wall without , and repair millo in the city of david , and make dart and shield in abundance .
and he set captain of war over the people , and gather they together to he in the street of the gate of the city , and spake comfortably to they , say ,
be strong and courageous , be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria , nor for all the multitude that be with he : for there be more with we than with he :
with he be a arm of flesh ; but with we be the lord we god to help we , and to fight we battle .
and the people rest themselves upon the word of hezekiah king of judah .
after this do sennacherib king of assyria send he servant to jerusalem , ( but he himself lay siege against lachish , and all he power with he , ) unto hezekiah king of judah , and unto all judah that be at jerusalem , say ,
thus saith sennacherib king of assyria , whereon do ye trust , that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem ?
doth not hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselve to die by famine and by thirst , say , the lord we god shall deliver we out of the hand of the king of assyria ?
hath not the same hezekiah take away he high place and he altar , and command judah and jerusalem , say , ye shall worship before one altar , and burn incense upon it ?
know ye not what i and my father have do unto all the people of other land ? be the god of the nation of those land any way able to deliver they land out of mine hand ?
who be there among all the god of those nation that my father utterly destroy , that could deliver he people out of mine hand , that you god should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
now therefore let not hezekiah deceive you , nor persuade you on this manner , neither yet believe he : for no god of any nation or kingdom be able to deliver he people out of mine hand , and out of the hand of my father : how much less shall you god deliver you out of mine hand ?
and he servant speak yet more against the lord god , and against he servant hezekiah .
he write also letter to rail on the lord god of israel , and to speak against he , say , as the god of the nation of other land have not deliver they people out of mine hand , so shall not the god of hezekiah deliver he people out of mine hand .
then they cry with a loud voice in the jews ' speech unto the people of jerusalem that be on the wall , to affright they , and to trouble they ; that they might take the city .
and they speak against the god of jerusalem , as against the god of the people of the earth , which be the work of the hand of man .
and for this cause hezekiah the king , and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz , pray and cry to heaven .
and the lord send a angel , which cut off all the mighty man of valour , and the leader and captain in the camp of the king of assyria .
so he return with shame of face to he own land .
and when he be come into the house of he god , they that come forth of he own bowels slew he there with the sword .
thus the lord save hezekiah and the inhabitant of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria , and from the hand of all other , and guide they on every side .
and many bring gift unto the lord to jerusalem , and present to hezekiah king of judah : so that he be magnify in the sight of all nation from thenceforth .
in those day hezekiah be sick to the death , and pray unto the lord : and he speak unto he , and he give he a sign .
but hezekiah render not again accord to the benefit do unto he ; for he heart be lift up : therefore there be wrath upon he , and upon judah and jerusalem .
notwithstanding hezekiah humble himself for the pride of he heart , both he and the inhabitant of jerusalem , so that the wrath of the lord come not upon they in the day of hezekiah .
and hezekiah have exceed much riches and honour : and he make himself treasury for silver , and for gold , and for precious stone , and for spice , and for shield , and for all manner of pleasant jewel ;
storehouses also for the increase of corn , and wine , and oil ; and stall for all manner of beast , and cote for flock .
moreover he provide he city , and possession of flock and herd in abundance : for god have give he substance very much .
this same hezekiah also stop the upper watercourse of gihon , and bring it straight down to the west side of the city of david .
and hezekiah prosper in all he work .
howbeit in the business of the ambassador of the prince of babylon , who send unto he to enquire of the wonder that be do in the land , god leave he , to try he , that he might know all that be in he heart .
now the rest of the act of hezekiah , and he goodness , behold , they be write in the vision of isaiah the prophet , the son of amoz , and in the book of the king of judah and israel .
and hezekiah sleep with he father , and they bury he in the chiefest of the sepulchre of the son of david : and all judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem do he honour at he death .
and manasseh he son reign in he stead .
manasseh be twelve year old when he begin to reign , and he reign fifty and five year in jerusalem :
but do that which be evil in the sight of the lord , like unto the abomination of the heathen , whom the lord have cast out before the child of israel .
for he build again the high place which hezekiah he father have break down , and he rear up altar for baalim , and make grove , and worship all the host of heaven , and serve they .
also he build altar in the house of the lord , whereof the lord have say , in jerusalem shall my name be for ever .
and he build altar for all the host of heaven in the two court of the house of the lord .
and he cause he child to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom : also he observe time , and use enchantment , and use witchcraft , and deal with a familiar spirit , and with wizard : he work much evil in the sight of the lord , to provoke he to anger .
and he set a carve image , the idol which he have make , in the house of god , of which god have say to david and to solomon he son , in this house , and in jerusalem , which i have choose before all the tribe of israel , will i put my name for ever :
neither will i any more remove the foot of israel from out of the land which i have appoint for you father ; so that they will take heed to do all that i have command they , accord to the whole law and the statute and the ordinance by the hand of moses .
so manasseh make judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem to err , and to do worse than the heathen , whom the lord have destroy before the child of israel .
and the lord spake to manasseh , and to he people : but they would not hearken .
wherefore the lord bring upon they the captain of the host of the king of assyria , which take manasseh among the thorn , and bind he with fetter , and carry he to babylon .
and when he be in affliction , he beseech the lord he god , and humble himself greatly before the god of he father ,
and pray unto he : and he be intreat of he , and hear he supplication , and bring he again to jerusalem into he kingdom .
then manasseh know that the lord he be god .
now after this he build a wall without the city of david , on the west side of gihon , in the valley , even to the enter in at the fish gate , and compass about ophel , and raise it up a very great height , and put captain of war in all the fenced city of judah .
and he take away the strange god , and the idol out of the house of the lord , and all the altar that he have build in the mount of the house of the lord , and in jerusalem , and cast they out of the city .
and he repair the altar of the lord , and sacrifice thereon peace offering and thank offering , and command judah to serve the lord god of israel .
nevertheless the people do sacrifice still in the high place , yet unto the lord they god only .
now the rest of the act of manasseh , and he prayer unto he god , and the word of the seer that speak to he in the name of the lord god of israel , behold , they be write in the book of the king of israel .
he prayer also , and how god be intreat of he , and all he sin , and he trespass , and the place wherein he build high place , and set up grove and grave image , before he be humble : behold , they be write among the saying of the seer .
so manasseh sleep with he father , and they bury he in he own house : and amon he son reign in he stead .
amon be two and twenty year old when he begin to reign , and reign two year in jerusalem .
but he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord , as do manasseh he father : for amon sacrifice unto all the carve image which manasseh he father have make , and serve they ;
and humble not himself before the lord , as manasseh he father have humble himself ; but amon trespass more and more .
and he servant conspire against he , and slew he in he own house .
but the people of the land slew all they that have conspire against king amon ; and the people of the land make josiah he son king in he stead .
josiah be eight year old when he begin to reign , and he reign in jerusalem one and thirty year .
and he do that which be right in the sight of the lord , and walk in the way of david he father , and decline neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
for in the eighth year of he reign , while he be yet young , he begin to seek after the god of david he father : and in the twelfth year he begin to purge judah and jerusalem from the high place , and the grove , and the carve image , and the molten image .
and they brake down the altar of baalim in he presence ; and the image , that be on high above they , he cut down ; and the grove , and the carve image , and the molten image , he brake in piece , and make dust of they , and strow it upon the grave of they that have sacrifice unto they .
and he burn the bone of the priest upon they altar , and cleansed judah and jerusalem .
and so do he in the city of manasseh , and ephraim , and simeon , even unto naphtali , with they mattock round about .
and when he have break down the altar and the grove , and have beat the graven image into powder , and cut down all the idol throughout all the land of israel , he return to jerusalem .
now in the eighteenth year of he reign , when he have purge the land , and the house , he send shaphan the son of azaliah , and maaseiah the governor of the city , and joah the son of joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of the lord he god .
and when they come to hilkiah the high priest , they deliver the money that be bring into the house of god , which the levites that keep the door have gather of the hand of manasseh and ephraim , and of all the remnant of israel , and of all judah and benjamin ; and they return to jerusalem .
and they put it in the hand of the workman that have the oversight of the house of the lord , and they give it to the workman that work in the house of the lord , to repair and amend the house :
even to the artificer and builder give they it , to buy hew stone , and timber for coupling , and to floor the house which the king of judah have destroy .
and the man do the work faithfully : and the overseer of they be jahath and obadiah , the levites , of the son of merari ; and zechariah and meshullam , of the son of the kohathites , to set it forward ; and other of the levites , all that could skill of instrument of musick .
also they be over the bearer of burden , and be overseer of all that work the work in any manner of service : and of the levites there be scribe , and officer , and porter .
and when they bring out the money that be bring into the house of the lord , hilkiah the priest find a book of the law of the lord give by moses .
and hilkiah answer and say to shaphan the scribe , i have find the book of the law in the house of the lord .
and hilkiah deliver the book to shaphan .
and shaphan carry the book to the king , and bring the king word back again , say , all that be commit to thy servant , they do it .
and they have gather together the money that be find in the house of the lord , and have deliver it into the hand of the overseer , and to the hand of the workman .
then shaphan the scribe tell the king , say , hilkiah the priest have give i a book .
and shaphan read it before the king .
and it come to pass , when the king have hear the word of the law , that he rent he clothes .
and the king command hilkiah , and ahikam the son of shaphan , and abdon the son of micah , and shaphan the scribe , and asaiah a servant of the king 's , say ,
go , enquire of the lord for i , and for they that be leave in israel and in judah , concern the word of the book that be find : for great be the wrath of the lord that be pour out upon we , because we father have not keep the word of the lord , to do after all that be write in this book .
and hilkiah , and they that the king have appoint , go to huldah the prophetess , the wife of shallum the son of tikvath , the son of hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwell in jerusalem in the college : ) and they speak to she to that effect .
and she answer they , thus saith the lord god of israel , tell ye the man that send you to i ,
thus saith the lord , behold , i will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitant thereof , even all the curse that be write in the book which they have read before the king of judah :
because they have forsake i , and have burn incense unto other god , that they might provoke i to anger with all the work of they hand ; therefore my wrath shall be pour out upon this place , and shall not be quench .
and as for the king of judah , who send you to enquire of the lord , so shall ye say unto he , thus saith the lord god of israel concern the word which thou hast hear ;
because thine heart be tender , and thou didst humble thyself before god , when thou heardest he word against this place , and against the inhabitant thereof , and humbledst thyself before i , and didst rend thy clothes , and weep before i ; i have even hear thee also , saith the lord .
behold , i will gather thee to thy father , and thou shalt be gather to thy grave in peace , neither shall thine eye see all the evil that i will bring upon this place , and upon the inhabitant of the same .
so they bring the king word again .
then the king send and gather together all the elder of judah and jerusalem .
and the king go up into the house of the lord , and all the man of judah , and the inhabitant of jerusalem , and the priest , and the levites , and all the people , great and small : and he read in they ear all the word of the book of the covenant that be find in the house of the lord .
and the king stand in he place , and make a covenant before the lord , to walk after the lord , and to keep he commandment , and he testimony , and he statute , with all he heart , and with all he soul , to perform the word of the covenant which be write in this book .
and he cause all that be present in jerusalem and benjamin to stand to it .
and the inhabitant of jerusalem do accord to the covenant of god , the god of they father .
and josiah take away all the abomination out of all the country that pertain to the child of israel , and make all that be present in israel to serve , even to serve the lord they god .
and all he day they depart not from follow the lord , the god of they father .
moreover josiah keep a passover unto the lord in jerusalem : and they kill the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month .
and he set the priest in they charge , and encourage they to the service of the house of the lord ,
and say unto the levites that teach all israel , which be holy unto the lord , put the holy ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel do build ; it shall not be a burden upon you shoulder : serve now the lord you god , and he people israel ,
and prepare yourselve by the house of you father , after you course , accord to the writing of david king of israel , and accord to the writing of solomon he son .
and stand in the holy place accord to the division of the family of the father of you brethren the people , and after the division of the family of the levites .
so kill the passover , and sanctify yourselve , and prepare you brethren , that they may do accord to the word of the lord by the hand of moses .
and josiah give to the people , of the flock , lamb and kid , all for the passover offering , for all that be present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bullock : these be of the king 's substance .
and he prince give willingly unto the people , to the priest , and to the levites : hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel , ruler of the house of god , give unto the priest for the passover offering two thousand and six hundred small cattle , and three hundred ox .
conaniah also , and shemaiah and nethaneel , he brethren , and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad , chief of the levites , give unto the levites for passover offering five thousand small cattle , and five hundred ox .
so the service be prepare , and the priest stand in they place , and the levites in they course , accord to the king 's commandment .
and they kill the passover , and the priest sprinkle the blood from they hand , and the levites flay they .
and they remove the burnt offering , that they might give accord to the division of the family of the people , to offer unto the lord , as it be write in the book of moses .
and so do they with the ox .
and they roasted the passover with fire accord to the ordinance : but the other holy offering sod they in pot , and in caldron , and in pan , and divide they speedily among all the people .
and afterward they make ready for themselves , and for the priest : because the priest the son of aaron be busy in offering of burnt offering and the fat until night ; therefore the levites prepare for themselves , and for the priest the son of aaron .
and the singer the son of asaph be in they place , accord to the commandment of david , and asaph , and heman , and jeduthun the king 's seer ; and the porter wait at every gate ; they might not depart from they service ; for they brethren the levites prepare for they .
so all the service of the lord be prepare the same day , to keep the passover , and to offer burnt offering upon the altar of the lord , accord to the commandment of king josiah .
and the child of israel that be present keep the passover at that time , and the feast of unleavened bread seven day .
and there be no passover like to that keep in israel from the day of samuel the prophet ; neither do all the king of israel keep such a passover as josiah keep , and the priest , and the levites , and all judah and israel that be present , and the inhabitant of jerusalem .
in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah be this passover keep .
after all this , when josiah have prepare the temple , necho king of egypt come up to fight against charchemish by euphrates : and josiah go out against he .
but he send ambassador to he , say , what have i to do with thee , thou king of judah ?
i come not against thee this day , but against the house wherewith i have war : for god command i to make haste : forbear thee from meddle with god , who be with i , that he destroy thee not .
nevertheless josiah would not turn he face from he , but disguise himself , that he might fight with he , and hearken not unto the word of necho from the mouth of god , and come to fight in the valley of megiddo .
and the archer shoot at king josiah ; and the king say to he servant , have i away ; for i be sore wound .
he servant therefore take he out of that chariot , and put he in the second chariot that he have ; and they bring he to jerusalem , and he die , and be bury in one of the sepulchre of he father .
and all judah and jerusalem mourn for josiah .
and jeremiah lament for josiah : and all the singing man and the singing woman speak of josiah in they lamentation to this day , and make they a ordinance in israel : and , behold , they be write in the lamentation .
now the rest of the act of josiah , and he goodness , accord to that which be write in the law of the lord ,
and he deed , first and last , behold , they be write in the book of the king of israel and judah .
then the people of the land take jehoahaz the son of josiah , and make he king in he father 's stead in jerusalem .
jehoahaz be twenty and three year old when he begin to reign , and he reign three month in jerusalem .
and the king of egypt put he down at jerusalem , and condemn the land in a hundred talent of silver and a talent of gold .
and the king of egypt make eliakim he brother king over judah and jerusalem , and turn he name to jehoiakim .
and necho take jehoahaz he brother , and carry he to egypt .
jehoiakim be twenty and five year old when he begin to reign , and he reign eleven year in jerusalem : and he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord he god .
against he come up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon , and bind he in fetter , to carry he to babylon .
nebuchadnezzar also carry of the vessel of the house of the lord to babylon , and put they in he temple at babylon .
now the rest of the act of jehoiakim , and he abomination which he do , and that which be find in he , behold , they be write in the book of the king of israel and judah : and jehoiachin he son reign in he stead .
jehoiachin be eight year old when he begin to reign , and he reign three month and ten day in jerusalem : and he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord .
and when the year be expire , king nebuchadnezzar send , and bring he to babylon , with the goodly vessel of the house of the lord , and make zedekiah he brother king over judah and jerusalem .
zedekiah be one and twenty year old when he begin to reign , and reign eleven year in jerusalem .
and he do that which be evil in the sight of the lord he god , and humble not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the lord .
and he also rebel against king nebuchadnezzar , who have make he swear by god : but he stiffen he neck , and harden he heart from turn unto the lord god of israel .
moreover all the chief of the priest , and the people , transgress very much after all the abomination of the heathen ; and polluted the house of the lord which he have hallowed in jerusalem .
and the lord god of they father send to they by he messenger , rise up betime , and send ; because he have compassion on he people , and on he dwelling place :
but they mock the messenger of god , and despise he word , and misuse he prophet , until the wrath of the lord arise against he people , till there be no remedy .
therefore he bring upon they the king of the chaldees , who slew they young man with the sword in the house of they sanctuary , and have no compassion upon young man or maiden , old man , or he that stoop for age : he give they all into he hand .
and all the vessel of the house of god , great and small , and the treasure of the house of the lord , and the treasure of the king , and of he prince ; all these he bring to babylon .
and they burn the house of god , and brake down the wall of jerusalem , and burnt all the palace thereof with fire , and destroy all the goodly vessel thereof .
and they that have escape from the sword carry he away to babylon ; where they be servant to he and he son until the reign of the kingdom of persia :
to fulfil the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah , until the land have enjoy she sabbath : for as long as she lay desolate she keep sabbath , to fulfil threescore and ten year .
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia , that the word of the lord speak by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplish , the lord stir up the spirit of cyrus king of persia , that he make a proclamation throughout all he kingdom , and put it also in write , say ,
thus saith cyrus king of persia , all the kingdom of the earth have the lord god of heaven give i ; and he have charge i to build he a house in jerusalem , which be in judah .
who be there among you of all he people ?
the lord he god be with he , and let he go up .
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia , that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfil , the lord stir up the spirit of cyrus king of persia , that he make a proclamation throughout all he kingdom , and put it also in write , say ,
thus saith cyrus king of persia , the lord god of heaven have give i all the kingdom of the earth ; and he have charge i to build he a house at jerusalem , which be in judah .
who be there among you of all he people ? he god be with he , and let he go up to jerusalem , which be in judah , and build the house of the lord god of israel , ( he be the god , ) which be in jerusalem .
and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth , let the man of he place help he with silver , and with gold , and with goods , and with beast , beside the freewill offering for the house of god that be in jerusalem .
then rise up the chief of the father of judah and benjamin , and the priest , and the levites , with all they whose spirit god have raise , to go up to build the house of the lord which be in jerusalem .
and all they that be about they strengthen they hand with vessel of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beast , and with precious thing , beside all that be willingly offer .
also cyrus the king bring forth the vessel of the house of the lord , which nebuchadnezzar have bring forth out of jerusalem , and have put they in the house of he god ;
even those do cyrus king of persia bring forth by the hand of mithredath the treasurer , and number they unto sheshbazzar , the prince of judah .
and this be the number of they : thirty charger of gold , a thousand charger of silver , nine and twenty knife ,

and the tirshatha say unto they , that they should not eat of the most holy thing , till there stand up a priest with urim and with thummim .

and some of the chief of the father , when they come to the house of the lord which be at jerusalem , offer freely for the house of god to set it up in he place :
they give after they ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand dram of gold , and five thousand pound of silver , and one hundred priest ' garment .
so the priest , and the levites , and some of the people , and the singer , and the porter , and the nethinim , dwelt in they city , and all israel in they city .
and when the seventh month be come , and the child of israel be in the city , the people gather themselves together as one man to jerusalem .
then stand up jeshua the son of jozadak , and he brethren the priest , and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , and he brethren , and build the altar of the god of israel , to offer burnt offering thereon , as it be write in the law of moses the man of god .
and they set the altar upon he basis ; for fear be upon they because of the people of those country : and they offer burnt offering thereon unto the lord , even burnt offering morning and evening .
they keep also the feast of tabernacle , as it be write , and offer the daily burnt offering by number , accord to the custom , as the duty of every day require ;
and afterward offer the continual burnt offering , both of the new moon , and of all the set feast of the lord that be consecrate , and of every one that willingly offer a freewill offering unto the lord .
from the first day of the seventh month begin they to offer burnt offering unto the lord .
but the foundation of the temple of the lord be not yet lay .
they give money also unto the mason , and to the carpenter ; and meat , and drink , and oil , unto they of zidon , and to they of tyre , to bring cedar tree from lebanon to the sea of joppa , accord to the grant that they have of cyrus king of persia .
now in the second year of they come unto the house of god at jerusalem , in the second month , begin zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , and jeshua the son of jozadak , and the remnant of they brethren the priest and the levites , and all they that be come out of the captivity unto jerusalem ; and appoint the levites , from twenty year old and upward , to set forward the work of the house of the lord .
then stand jeshua with he son and he brethren , kadmiel and he son , the son of judah , together , to set forward the workman in the house of god : the son of henadad , with they son and they brethren the levites .
and when the builder lay the foundation of the temple of the lord , they set the priest in they apparel with trumpet , and the levites the son of asaph with cymbal , to praise the lord , after the ordinance of david king of israel .
and they sing together by course in praise and give thanks unto the lord ; because he be good , for he mercy endureth for ever toward israel .
and all the people shout with a great shout , when they praise the lord , because the foundation of the house of the lord be lay .
but many of the priest and levite and chief of the father , who be ancient man , that have see the first house , when the foundation of this house be lay before they eye , weep with a loud voice ; and many shout aloud for joy :
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weep of the people : for the people shout with a loud shout , and the noise be hear afar off .
now when the adversary of judah and benjamin hear that the child of the captivity build the temple unto the lord god of israel ;
then they come to zerubbabel , and to the chief of the father , and say unto they , let we build with you : for we seek you god , as ye do ; and we do sacrifice unto he since the day of esarhaddon king of assur , which bring we up hither .
but zerubbabel , and jeshua , and the rest of the chief of the father of israel , say unto they , ye have nothing to do with we to build a house unto we god ; but we ourselves together will build unto the lord god of israel , as king cyrus the king of persia have command we .
then the people of the land weaken the hand of the people of judah , and trouble they in building ,
and hire counsellor against they , to frustrate they purpose , all the day of cyrus king of persia , even until the reign of darius king of persia .
and in the reign of ahasuerus , in the beginning of he reign , write they unto he a accusation against the inhabitant of judah and jerusalem .
and in the day of artaxerxes write bishlam , mithredath , tabeel , and the rest of they companion , unto artaxerxes king of persia ; and the writing of the letter be write in the syrian tongue , and interpret in the syrian tongue .
rehum the chancellor and shimshaus the scribe write a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort :
then write rehum the chancellor , and shimshai the scribe , and the rest of they companion ; the dinaites , the apharsathchites , the tarpelites , the apharsites , the archevites , the babylonians , the susanchites , the dehavites , and the elamites ,
and the rest of the nation whom the great and noble asnapper bring over , and set in the city of samaria , and the rest that be on this side the river , and at such a time .
this be the copy of the letter that they send unto he , even unto artaxerxes the king ; thy servant the man on this side the river , and at such a time .
be it know unto the king , that the jews which come up from thee to we be come unto jerusalem , build the rebellious and the bad city , and have set up the wall thereof , and join the foundation .
be it know now unto the king , that , if this city be build , and the wall set up again , then will they not pay toll , tribute , and custom , and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the king .
now because we have maintenance from the king 's palace , and it be not meet for we to see the king 's dishonour , therefore have we send and certify the king ;
that search may be make in the book of the record of thy father : so shalt thou find in the book of the record , and know that this city be a rebellious city , and hurtful unto king and province , and that they have move sedition within the same of old time : for which cause be this city destroy .
we certify the king that , if this city be build again , and the wall thereof set up , by this mean thou shalt have no portion on this side the river .
then send the king a answer unto rehum the chancellor , and to shimshai the scribe , and to the rest of they companion that dwell in samaria , and unto the rest beyond the river , peace , and at such a time .
the letter which ye send unto we have be plainly read before i .
and i command , and search have be make , and it be find that this city of old time have make insurrection against king , and that rebellion and sedition have be make therein .
there have be mighty king also over jerusalem , which have rule over all country beyond the river ; and toll , tribute , and custom , be pay unto they .
give ye now commandment to cause these man to cease , and that this city be not build , until another commandment shall be give from i .
take heed now that ye fail not to do this : why should damage grow to the hurt of the king ?
now when the copy of king artaxerx ' letter be read before rehum , and shimshai the scribe , and they companion , they go up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews , and make they to cease by force and power .
then cease the work of the house of god which be at jerusalem .
so it cease unto the second year of the reign of darius king of persia .
then the prophet , haggai the prophet , and zechariah the son of iddo , prophesy unto the jews that be in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel , even unto they .
then rise up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , and jeshua the son of jozadak , and begin to build the house of god which be at jerusalem : and with they be the prophet of god help they .
at the same time come to they tatnai , governor on this side the river , and shetharboznai , and they companion , and say thus unto they , who have command you to build this house , and to make up this wall ?
then say we unto they after this manner , what be the name of the man that make this building ?
but the eye of they god be upon the elder of the jews , that they could not cause they to cease , till the matter come to darius : and then they return answer by letter concern this matter .
the copy of the letter that tatnai , governor on this side the river , and shetharboznai , and he companion the apharsachites , which be on this side the river , send unto darius the king :
they send a letter unto he , wherein be write thus ; unto darius the king , all peace .
be it know unto the king , that we go into the province of judea , to the house of the great god , which be build with great stone , and timber be lay in the wall , and this work goeth fast on , and prospereth in they hand .
then ask we those elder , and say unto they thus , who command you to build this house , and to make up these wall ?
we ask they name also , to certify thee , that we might write the name of the man that be the chief of they .
and thus they return we answer , say , we be the servant of the god of heaven and earth , and build the house that be build these many year ago , which a great king of israel build and set up .
but after that we father have provoke the god of heaven unto wrath , he give they into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon , the chaldean , who destroy this house , and carry the people away into babylon .
but in the first year of cyrus the king of babylon the same king cyrus make a decree to build this house of god .
and the vessel also of gold and silver of the house of god , which nebuchadnezzar take out of the temple that be in jerusalem , and bring they into the temple of babylon , those do cyrus the king take out of the temple of babylon , and they be deliver unto one , whose name be sheshbazzar , whom he have make governor ;
and say unto he , take these vessel , go , carry they into the temple that be in jerusalem , and let the house of god be build in he place .
then come the same sheshbazzar , and lay the foundation of the house of god which be in jerusalem : and since that time even until now have it be in building , and yet it be not finish .
now therefore , if it seem good to the king , let there be search make in the king 's treasure house , which be there at babylon , whether it be so , that a decree be make of cyrus the king to build this house of god at jerusalem , and let the king send he pleasure to we concern this matter .
then darius the king make a decree , and search be make in the house of the roll , where the treasure be lay up in babylon .
and there be find at achmetha , in the palace that be in the province of the medes , a roll , and therein be a record thus write :
in the first year of cyrus the king the same cyrus the king make a decree concern the house of god at jerusalem , let the house be build , the place where they offer sacrifice , and let the foundation thereof be strongly lay ; the height thereof threescore cubit , and the breadth thereof threescore cubit ;
with three row of great stone , and a row of new timber : and let the expense be give out of the king 's house :
and also let the golden and silver vessel of the house of god , which nebuchadnezzar take forth out of the temple which be at jerusalem , and bring unto babylon , be restore , and bring again unto the temple which be at jerusalem , every one to he place , and place they in the house of god .
now therefore , tatnai , governor beyond the river , shetharboznai , and you companion the apharsachites , which be beyond the river , be ye far from thence :
let the work of this house of god alone ; let the governor of the jews and the elder of the jews build this house of god in he place .
moreover i make a decree what ye shall do to the elder of these jew for the building of this house of god : that of the king 's goods , even of the tribute beyond the river , forthwith expense be give unto these man , that they be not hinder .
and that which they have need of , both young bullock , and ram , and lamb , for the burnt offering of the god of heaven , wheat , salt , wine , and oil , accord to the appointment of the priest which be at jerusalem , let it be give they day by day without fail :
that they may offer sacrifice of sweet savour unto the god of heaven , and pray for the life of the king , and of he son .
also i have make a decree , that whosoever shall alter this word , let timber be pull down from he house , and be set up , let he be hang thereon ; and let he house be make a dunghill for this .
and the god that have cause he name to dwell there destroy all king and people , that shall put to they hand to alter and to destroy this house of god which be at jerusalem .
i darius have make a decree ; let it be do with speed .
then tatnai , governor on this side the river , shetharboznai , and they companion , accord to that which darius the king have send , so they do speedily .
and the elder of the jews build , and they prosper through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo .
and they build , and finish it , accord to the commandment of the god of israel , and accord to the commandment of cyrus , and darius , and artaxerxes king of persia .
and this house be finish on the third day of the month adar , which be in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king .
and the child of israel , the priest , and the levites , and the rest of the child of the captivity , keep the dedication of this house of god with joy ,
and offer at the dedication of this house of god a hundred bullock , two hundred ram , four hundred lamb ; and for a sin offering for all israel , twelve he goat , accord to the number of the tribe of israel .
and they set the priest in they division , and the levites in they course , for the service of god , which be at jerusalem ; as it be write in the book of moses .
and the child of the captivity keep the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month .
for the priest and the levites be purify together , all of they be pure , and kill the passover for all the child of the captivity , and for they brethren the priest , and for themselves .
and the child of israel , which be come again out of captivity , and all such as have separate themselves unto they from the filthiness of the heathen of the land , to seek the lord god of israel , do eat ,
and keep the feast of unleavened bread seven day with joy : for the lord have make they joyful , and turn the heart of the king of assyria unto they , to strengthen they hand in the work of the house of god , the god of israel .
now after these thing , in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia , ezra the son of seraiah , the son of azariah , the son of hilkiah ,
the son of shallum , the son of zadok , the son of ahitub ,
the son of amariah , the son of azariah , the son of meraioth ,

and there go up some of the child of israel , and of the priest , and the levites , and the singer , and the porter , and the nethinim , unto jerusalem , in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king .
and he come to jerusalem in the fifth month , which be in the seventh year of the king .
for upon the first day of the first month begin he to go up from babylon , and on the first day of the fifth month come he to jerusalem , accord to the good hand of he god upon he .
for ezra have prepare he heart to seek the law of the lord , and to do it , and to teach in israel statute and judgment .
now this be the copy of the letter that the king artaxerxes give unto ezra the priest , the scribe , even a scribe of the word of the commandment of the lord , and of he statute to israel .
artaxerxes , king of king , unto ezra the priest , a scribe of the law of the god of heaven , perfect peace , and at such a time .
i make a decree , that all they of the people of israel , and of he priest and levites , in my realm , which be mind of they own freewill to go up to jerusalem , go with thee .
forasmuch as thou art send of the king , and of he seven counsellor , to enquire concern judah and jerusalem , accord to the law of thy god which be in thine hand ;

bless be the lord god of we father , which have put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to beautify the house of the lord which be in jerusalem :
and have extended mercy unto i before the king , and he counsellor , and before all the king 's mighty prince .
and i be strengthen as the hand of the lord my god be upon i , and i gather together out of israel chief man to go up with i .
these be now the chief of they father , and this be the genealogy of they that go up with i from babylon , in the reign of artaxerxes the king .
of the son of phinehas ; gershom : of the son of ithamar ; daniel : of the son of david ; hattush .
of the son of shechaniah , of the son of pharosh ; zechariah : and with he be reckon by genealogy of the male a hundred and fifty .
of the son of pahathmoab ; elihoenai the son of zerahiah , and with he two hundred male .
of the son of shechaniah ; the son of jahaziel , and with he three hundred male .
of the son also of adin ; ebe the son of jonathan , and with he fifty male .
and of the son of elam ; jeshaiah the son of athaliah , and with he seventy male .
and of the son of shephatiah ; zebadiah the son of michael , and with he fourscore male .
of the son of joab ; obadiah the son of jehiel , and with he two hundred and eighteen male .
and of the son of shelomith ; the son of josiphiah , and with he a hundred and threescore male .
and of the son of bebai ; zechariah the son of bebai , and with he twenty and eight male .
and of the son of azgad ; johanan the son of hakkatan , and with he a hundred and ten male .
and of the last son of adonikam , whose name be these , eliphelet , jeiel , and shemaiah , and with they threescore male .
of the son also of bigvai ; uthai , and zabbud , and with they seventy male .
and i gather they together to the river that runneth to ahava ; and there abode we in tent three day : and i view the people , and the priest , and find there none of the son of levi .
then send i for eliezer , for ariel , for shemaiah , and for elnathan , and for jarib , and for elnathan , and for nathan , and for zechariah , and for meshullam , chief man ; also for joiarib , and for elnathan , man of understanding .
and i send they with commandment unto iddo the chief at the place casiphia , and i tell they what they should say unto iddo , and to he brethren the nethinim , at the place casiphia , that they should bring unto we minister for the house of we god .
and by the good hand of we god upon we they bring we a man of understanding , of the son of mahli , the son of levi , the son of israel ; and sherebiah , with he son and he brethren , eighteen ;
and hashabiah , and with he jeshaiah of the son of merari , he brethren and they son , twenty ;
also of the nethinims , whom david and the prince have appoint for the service of the levites , two hundred and twenty nethinim : all of they be express by name .
then i proclaim a fast there , at the river of ahava , that we might afflict ourselves before we god , to seek of he a right way for we , and for we little one , and for all we substance .
for i be ashamed to require of the king a band of soldier and horseman to help we against the enemy in the way : because we have speak unto the king , say , the hand of we god be upon all they for good that seek he ; but he power and he wrath be against all they that forsake he .
so we fast and besought we god for this : and he be intreat of we .
then i separate twelve of the chief of the priest , sherebiah , hashabiah , and ten of they brethren with they ,
and weigh unto they the silver , and the gold , and the vessel , even the offering of the house of we god , which the king , and he counsellor , and he lord , and all israel there present , have offer :
i even weigh unto they hand six hundred and fifty talent of silver , and silver vessel a hundred talent , and of gold a hundred talent ;
also twenty bason of gold , of a thousand dram ; and two vessel of fine copper , precious as gold .
and i say unto they , ye be holy unto the lord ; the vessel be holy also ; and the silver and the gold be a freewill offering unto the lord god of you father .
watch ye , and keep they , until ye weigh they before the chief of the priest and the levites , and chief of the father of israel , at jerusalem , in the chamber of the house of the lord .
so take the priest and the levites the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessel , to bring they to jerusalem unto the house of we god .
then we depart from the river of ahava on the twelfth day of the first month , to go unto jerusalem : and the hand of we god be upon we , and he deliver we from the hand of the enemy , and of such as lay in wait by the way .
and we come to jerusalem , and abode there three day .
now on the fourth day be the silver and the gold and the vessel weigh in the house of we god by the hand of meremoth the son of uriah the priest ; and with he be eleazar the son of phinehas ; and with they be jozabad the son of jeshua , and noadiah the son of binnui , levites ;
by number and by weight of every one : and all the weight be write at that time .
also the child of those that have be carry away , which be come out of the captivity , offer burnt offering unto the god of israel , twelve bullock for all israel , ninety and six ram , seventy and seven lamb , twelve he goat for a sin offering : all this be a burnt offering unto the lord .
and they deliver the king 's commission unto the king 's lieutenant , and to the governor on this side the river : and they further the people , and the house of god .
now when these thing be do , the prince come to i , say , the people of israel , and the priest , and the levites , have not separate themselves from the people of the land , do accord to they abomination , even of the canaanites , the hittites , the perizzites , the jebusites , the ammonites , the moabites , the egyptians , and the amorites .
for they have take of they daughter for themselves , and for they son : so that the holy seed have mingle themselves with the people of those land : yea , the hand of the prince and ruler have be chief in this trespass .
and when i hear this thing , i rent my garment and my mantle , and pluck off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sit down astonied .
then be assemble unto i every one that tremble at the word of the god of israel , because of the transgression of those that have be carry away ; and i sit astony until the evening sacrifice .
and at the evening sacrifice i arise up from my heaviness ; and have rent my garment and my mantle , i fall upon my knee , and spread out my hand unto the lord my god ,
and say , o my god , i be ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee , my god : for we iniquity be increase over we head , and we trespass be grow up unto the heaven .
since the day of we father have we be in a great trespass unto this day ; and for we iniquity have we , we king , and we priest , be deliver into the hand of the king of the land , to the sword , to captivity , and to a spoil , and to confusion of face , as it be this day .
and now for a little space grace have be shew from the lord we god , to leave we a remnant to escape , and to give we a nail in he holy place , that we god may lighten we eye , and give we a little revive in we bondage .
for we be bondmen ; yet we god have not forsake we in we bondage , but have extend mercy unto we in the sight of the king of persia , to give we a revive , to set up the house of we god , and to repair the desolation thereof , and to give we a wall in judah and in jerusalem .
and now , o we god , what shall we say after this ? for we have forsake thy commandment ,
which thou hast command by thy servant the prophet , say , the land , unto which ye go to possess it , be a unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the land , with they abomination , which have fill it from one end to another with they uncleanness .
now therefore give not you daughter unto they son , neither take they daughter unto you son , nor seek they peace or they wealth for ever : that ye may be strong , and eat the good of the land , and leave it for a inheritance to you child for ever .
and after all that be come upon we for we evil deed , and for we great trespass , see that thou we god hast punish we less than we iniquity deserve , and hast give we such deliverance as this ;
should we again break thy commandment , and join in affinity with the people of these abomination ? wouldest not thou be angry with we till thou hadst consume we , so that there should be no remnant nor escape ?
o lord god of israel , thou art righteous : for we remain yet escape , as it be this day : behold , we be before thee in we trespass : for we can not stand before thee because of this .
now when ezra have pray , and when he have confess , weep and cast himself down before the house of god , there assemble unto he out of israel a very great congregation of man and woman and child : for the people weep very sore .
and shechaniah the son of jehiel , one of the son of elam , answer and say unto ezra , we have trespass against we god , and have take strange wife of the people of the land : yet now there be hope in israel concern this thing .
now therefore let we make a covenant with we god to put away all the wife , and such as be bear of they , accord to the counsel of my lord , and of those that tremble at the commandment of we god ; and let it be do accord to the law .
arise ; for this matter belongeth unto thee : we also will be with thee : be of good courage , and do it .
then arise ezra , and make the chief priest , the levites , and all israel , to swear that they should do accord to this word .
and they sware .
then ezra rise up from before the house of god , and go into the chamber of johanan the son of eliashib : and when he come thither , he do eat no bread , nor drink water : for he mourn because of the transgression of they that have be carry away .
and they make proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto all the child of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto jerusalem ;
and that whosoever would not come within three day , accord to the counsel of the prince and the elder , all he substance should be forfeit , and himself separate from the congregation of those that have be carry away .
then all the man of judah and benjamin gather themselves together unto jerusalem within three day .
it be the ninth month , on the twentieth day of the month ; and all the people sit in the street of the house of god , tremble because of this matter , and for the great rain .
and ezra the priest stand up , and say unto they , ye have transgress , and have take strange wife , to increase the trespass of israel .
now therefore make confession unto the lord god of you father , and do he pleasure : and separate yourselve from the people of the land , and from the strange wife .
then all the congregation answer and say with a loud voice , as thou hast say , so must we do .
but the people be many , and it be a time of much rain , and we be not able to stand without , neither be this a work of one day or two : for we be many that have transgress in this thing .
let now we ruler of all the congregation stand , and let all they which have take strange wife in we city come at appoint time , and with they the elder of every city , and the judge thereof , until the fierce wrath of we god for this matter be turn from we .
only jonathan the son of asahel and jahaziah the son of tikvah be employ about this matter : and meshullam and shabbethai the levite help they .
and the child of the captivity do so .
and ezra the priest , with certain chief of the father , after the house of they father , and all of they by they name , be separate , and sit down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter .
and they make a end with all the man that have take strange wife by the first day of the first month .
and among the son of the priest there be find that have take strange wife : namely , of the son of jeshua the son of jozadak , and he brethren ; maaseiah , and eliezer , and jarib , and gedaliah .

the word of nehemiah the son of hachaliah .
and it come to pass in the month chisleu , in the twentieth year , as i be in shushan the palace ,
that hanani , one of my brethren , come , he and certain man of judah ; and i ask they concern the jews that have escape , which be leave of the captivity , and concern jerusalem .
and they say unto i , the remnant that be leave of the captivity there in the province be in great affliction and reproach : the wall of jerusalem also be break down , and the gate thereof be burn with fire .
and it come to pass , when i hear these word , that i sit down and weep , and mourn certain day , and fast , and pray before the god of heaven ,
and say , i beseech thee , o lord god of heaven , the great and terrible god , that keepeth covenant and mercy for they that love he and observe he commandment :
let thine ear now be attentive , and thine eye open , that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant , which i pray before thee now , day and night , for the child of israel thy servant , and confess the sin of the child of israel , which we have sin against thee : both i and my father 's house have sin .
we have deal very corruptly against thee , and have not keep the commandment , nor the statute , nor the judgment , which thou commandedst thy servant mose .
remember , i beseech thee , the word that thou commandedst thy servant mose , say , if ye transgress , i will scatter you abroad among the nation :
but if ye turn unto i , and keep my commandment , and do they ; though there be of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven , yet will i gather they from thence , and will bring they unto the place that i have choose to set my name there .
now these be thy servant and thy people , whom thou hast redeem by thy great power , and by thy strong hand .
o lord , i beseech thee , let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant , and to the prayer of thy servant , who desire to fear thy name : and prosper , i pray thee , thy servant this day , and grant he mercy in the sight of this man .
for i be the king 's cupbearer .
and it come to pass in the month nisan , in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king , that wine be before he : and i take up the wine , and give it unto the king .
now i have not be beforetime sad in he presence .
wherefore the king say unto i , why be thy countenance sad , see thou art not sick ? this be nothing else but sorrow of heart .
then i be very sore afraid ,
and say unto the king , let the king live for ever : why should not my countenance be sad , when the city , the place of my father ' sepulchre , lieth waste , and the gate thereof be consume with fire ?
then the king say unto i , for what dost thou make request ?
so i pray to the god of heaven .
and i say unto the king , if it please the king , and if thy servant have find favour in thy sight , that thou wouldest send i unto judah , unto the city of my father ' sepulchre , that i may build it .
and the king say unto i , ( the queen also sit by he , ) for how long shall thy journey be ? and when wilt thou return ?
so it please the king to send i ; and i set he a time .
moreover i say unto the king , if it please the king , let letter be give i to the governor beyond the river , that they may convey i over till i come into judah ;
and a letter unto asaph the keeper of the king 's forest , that he may give i timber to make beam for the gate of the palace which appertain to the house , and for the wall of the city , and for the house that i shall enter into .
and the king grant i , accord to the good hand of my god upon i .
then i come to the governor beyond the river , and give they the king 's letter .
now the king have send captain of the army and horseman with i .
when sanballat the horonite , and tobiah the servant , the ammonite , hear of it , it grieve they exceedingly that there be come a man to seek the welfare of the child of israel .
so i come to jerusalem , and be there three day .
and i arise in the night , i and some few man with i ; neither tell i any man what my god have put in my heart to do at jerusalem : neither be there any beast with i , save the beast that i ride upon .
and i go out by night by the gate of the valley , even before the dragon well , and to the dung port , and view the wall of jerusalem , which be break down , and the gate thereof be consume with fire .
then i go on to the gate of the fountain , and to the king 's pool : but there be no place for the beast that be under i to pass .
then go i up in the night by the brook , and view the wall , and turn back , and enter by the gate of the valley , and so return .
and the ruler know not whither i go , or what i do ; neither have i as yet tell it to the jews , nor to the priest , nor to the noble , nor to the ruler , nor to the rest that do the work .
then say i unto they , ye see the distress that we be in , how jerusalem lieth waste , and the gate thereof be burn with fire : come , and let we build up the wall of jerusalem , that we be no more a reproach .
then i tell they of the hand of my god which be good upon i ; as also the king 's word that he have speak unto i .
and they say , let we rise up and build .
so they strengthen they hand for this good work .
but when sanballat the horonite , and tobiah the servant , the ammonite , and geshem the arabian , hear it , they laugh we to scorn , and despise we , and say , what be this thing that ye do ? will ye rebel against the king ?
then answer i they , and say unto they , the god of heaven , he will prosper we ; therefore we he servant will arise and build : but ye have no portion , nor right , nor memorial , in jerusalem .

but it come to pass , that when sanballat hear that we build the wall , he be wroth , and take great indignation , and mock the jews .
and he speak before he brethren and the army of samaria , and say , what do these feeble jews ? will they fortify themselves ? will they sacrifice ? will they make a end in a day ? will they revive the stone out of the heap of the rubbish which be burn ?
now tobiah the ammonite be by he , and he say , even that which they build , if a fox go up , he shall even break down they stone wall .
hear , o we god ; for we be despise : and turn they reproach upon they own head , and give they for a prey in the land of captivity :
and cover not they iniquity , and let not they sin be blot out from before thee : for they have provoke thee to anger before the builder .
so build we the wall ; and all the wall be join together unto the half thereof : for the people have a mind to work .
but it come to pass , that when sanballat , and tobiah , and the arabians , and the ammonites , and the ashdodites , hear that the wall of jerusalem be make up , and that the breach begin to be stop , then they be very wroth ,
and conspire all of they together to come and to fight against jerusalem , and to hinder it .
nevertheless we make we prayer unto we god , and set a watch against they day and night , because of they .
and judah say , the strength of the bearer of burden be decay , and there be much rubbish ; so that we be not able to build the wall .
and we adversary say , they shall not know , neither see , till we come in the midst among they , and slay they , and cause the work to cease .
and it come to pass , that when the jews which dwell by they come , they say unto we ten time , from all place whence ye shall return unto we they will be upon you .
therefore set i in the lower place behind the wall , and on the higher place , i even set the people after they family with they sword , they spear , and they bow .
and i look , and rise up , and say unto the noble , and to the ruler , and to the rest of the people , be not ye afraid of they : remember the lord , which be great and terrible , and fight for you brethren , you son , and you daughter , you wife , and you house .
and it come to pass , when we enemy hear that it be know unto we , and god have bring they counsel to nought , that we return all of we to the wall , every one unto he work .
and it come to pass from that time forth , that the half of my servant work in the work , and the other half of they hold both the spear , the shield , and the bow , and the habergeon ; and the ruler be behind all the house of judah .
they which build on the wall , and they that bare burden , with those that lade , every one with one of he hand work in the work , and with the other hand hold a weapon .
for the builder , every one have he sword gird by he side , and so builded .
and he that sound the trumpet be by i .
and i say unto the noble , and to the ruler , and to the rest of the people , the work be great and large , and we be separate upon the wall , one far from another .
in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet , resort ye thither unto we : we god shall fight for we .
so we labour in the work : and half of they hold the spear from the rising of the morning till the star appear .
likewise at the same time say i unto the people , let every one with he servant lodge within jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to we , and labour on the day .
so neither i , nor my brethren , nor my servant , nor the man of the guard which follow i , none of we put off we clothes , save that every one put they off for wash .
and there be a great cry of the people and of they wife against they brethren the jews .
for there be that say , we , we son , and we daughter , be many : therefore we take up corn for they , that we may eat , and live .
some also there be that say , we have mortgage we land , vineyard , and house , that we might buy corn , because of the dearth .
there be also that say , we have borrow money for the king 's tribute , and that upon we land and vineyard .
yet now we flesh be as the flesh of we brethren , we child as they child : and , lo , we bring into bondage we son and we daughter to be servant , and some of we daughter be bring unto bondage already : neither be it in we power to redeem they ; for other man have we land and vineyard .
and i be very angry when i hear they cry and these word .
then i consult with myself , and i rebuke the noble , and the ruler , and say unto they , ye exact usury , every one of he brother .
and i set a great assembly against they .
and i say unto they , we after we ability have redeem we brethren the jews , which be sell unto the heathen ; and will ye even sell you brethren ? or shall they be sell unto we ?
then hold they they peace , and find nothing to answer .
also i say , it be not good that ye do : ought ye not to walk in the fear of we god because of the reproach of the heathen we enemy ?
i likewise , and my brethren , and my servant , might exact of they money and corn : i pray you , let we leave off this usury .
restore , i pray you , to they , even this day , they land , they vineyard , they oliveyard , and they house , also the hundredth part of the money , and of the corn , the wine , and the oil , that ye exact of they .
then say they , we will restore they , and will require nothing of they ; so will we do as thou sayest .
then i call the priest , and take a oath of they , that they should do accord to this promise .
also i shake my lap , and say , so god shake out every man from he house , and from he labour , that performeth not this promise , even thus be he shake out , and empty .
and all the congregation say , amen , and praise the lord .
and the people do accord to this promise .
moreover from the time that i be appoint to be they governor in the land of judah , from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king , that be , twelve year , i and my brethren have not eat the bread of the governor .
but the former governor that have be before i be chargeable unto the people , and have take of they bread and wine , beside forty shekel of silver ; yea , even they servant bare rule over the people : but so do not i , because of the fear of god .
yea , also i continue in the work of this wall , neither buy we any land : and all my servant be gather thither unto the work .
moreover there be at my table a hundred and fifty of the jews and ruler , beside those that come unto we from among the heathen that be about we .
now that which be prepare for i daily be one ox and six choice sheep ; also fowl be prepare for i , and once in ten day store of all sort of wine : yet for all this require not i the bread of the governor , because the bondage be heavy upon this people .
think upon i , my god , for good , accord to all that i have do for this people .
now it come to pass , when sanballat , and tobiah , and geshem the arabian , and the rest of we enemy , hear that i have build the wall , and that there be no breach leave therein ; ( though at that time i have not set up the door upon the gate ; )
that sanballat and geshem send unto i , say , come , let we meet together in some one of the village in the plain of ono .
but they think to do i mischief .
and i send messenger unto they , say , i be do a great work , so that i can not come down : why should the work cease , whilst i leave it , and come down to you ?
yet they send unto i four time after this sort ; and i answer they after the same manner .
then send sanballat he servant unto i in like manner the fifth time with a open letter in he hand ;
wherein be write , it be report among the heathen , and gashmu saith it , that thou and the jews think to rebel : for which cause thou buildest the wall , that thou mayest be they king , accord to these word .
and thou hast also appoint prophet to preach of thee at jerusalem , say , there be a king in judah : and now shall it be report to the king accord to these word .
come now therefore , and let we take counsel together .
then i send unto he , say , there be no such thing do as thou sayest , but thou feignest they out of thine own heart .
for they all make we afraid , say , they hand shall be weaken from the work , that it be not do .
now therefore , o god , strengthen my hand .
afterward i come unto the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabeel , who be shut up ; and he say , let we meet together in the house of god , within the temple , and let we shut the door of the temple : for they will come to slay thee ; yea , in the night will they come to slay thee .
and i say , should such a man as i flee ? and who be there , that , be as i be , would go into the temple to save he life ?
i will not go in .
and , lo , i perceive that god have not send he ; but that he pronounce this prophecy against i : for tobiah and sanballat have hire he .
therefore be he hire , that i should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for a evil report , that they might reproach i .
my god , think thou upon tobiah and sanballat accord to these they work , and on the prophetess noadiah , and the rest of the prophet , that would have put i in fear .
so the wall be finish in the twenty and fifth day of the month elul , in fifty and two day .
and it come to pass , that when all we enemy hear thereof , and all the heathen that be about we see these thing , they be much cast down in they own eye : for they perceive that this work be work of we god .
moreover in those day the noble of judah send many letter unto tobiah , and the letter of tobiah come unto they .
for there be many in judah swear unto he , because he be the son in law of shechaniah the son of arah ; and he son johanan have take the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah .
also they report he good deed before i , and utter my word to he .
and tobiah send letter to put i in fear .
now it come to pass , when the wall be build , and i have set up the door , and the porter and the singer and the levites be appoint ,
that i give my brother hanani , and hananiah the ruler of the palace , charge over jerusalem : for he be a faithful man , and fear god above many .
and i say unto they , let not the gate of jerusalem be open until the sun be hot ; and while they stand by , let they shut the door , and bar they : and appoint watch of the inhabitant of jerusalem , every one in he watch , and every one to be over against he house .
now the city be large and great : but the people be few therein , and the house be not build .
and my god put into mine heart to gather together the noble , and the ruler , and the people , that they might be reckon by genealogy .
and i find a register of the genealogy of they which come up at the first , and find write therein ,
these be the child of the province , that go up out of the captivity , of those that have be carry away , whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon have carry away , and come again to jerusalem and to judah , every one unto he city ;

and all the people gather themselves together as one man into the street that be before the water gate ; and they speak unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses , which the lord have command to israel .

and all the people go they way to eat , and to drink , and to send portion , and to make great mirth , because they have understand the word that be declare unto they .
and on the second day be gather together the chief of the father of all the people , the priest , and the levites , unto ezra the scribe , even to understand the word of the law .
and they find write in the law which the lord have command by moses , that the child of israel should dwell in booth in the feast of the seventh month :
and that they should publish and proclaim in all they city , and in jerusalem , say , go forth unto the mount , and fetch olive branch , and pine branch , and myrtle branch , and palm branch , and branch of thick tree , to make booth , as it be write .
so the people go forth , and bring they , and make themselves booth , every one upon the roof of he house , and in they court , and in the court of the house of god , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of ephraim .
and all the congregation of they that be come again out of the captivity make booth , and sit under the booth : for since the day of jeshua the son of nun unto that day have not the child of israel do so .
and there be very great gladness .

and they keep the feast seven day ; and on the eighth day be a solemn assembly , accord unto the manner .

and they stand up in they place , and read in the book of the law of the lord they god one fourth part of the day ; and another fourth part they confess , and worship the lord they god .
then stand up upon the stair , of the levites , jeshua , and bani , kadmiel , shebaniah , bunni , sherebiah , bani , and chenani , and cry with a loud voice unto the lord they god .
then the levites , jeshua , and kadmiel , bani , hashabniah , sherebiah , hodijah , shebaniah , and pethahiah , say , stand up and bless the lord you god for ever and ever : and bless be thy glorious name , which be exalt above all blessing and praise .
thou , even thou , art lord alone ; thou hast make heaven , the heaven of heaven , with all they host , the earth , and all thing that be therein , the sea , and all that be therein , and thou preservest they all ; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee .
thou art the lord the god , who do choose abram , and broughtest he forth out of ur of the chaldees , and gavest he the name of abraham ;
and foundest he heart faithful before thee , and madest a covenant with he to give the land of the canaanites , the hittites , the amorites , and the perizzites , and the jebusites , and the girgashites , to give it , i say , to he seed , and hast perform thy word ; for thou art righteous :
and didst see the affliction of we father in egypt , and heardest they cry by the red sea ;
and shewedst sign and wonder upon pharaoh , and on all he servant , and on all the people of he land : for thou knewest that they deal proudly against they .
so didst thou get thee a name , as it be this day .
and thou didst divide the sea before they , so that they go through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and they persecutor thou threwest into the deep , as a stone into the mighty water .
moreover thou leddest they in the day by a cloudy pillar ; and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give they light in the way wherein they should go .
thou camest down also upon mount sinai , and spakest with they from heaven , and gavest they right judgment , and true law , good statute and commandment :
and madest known unto they thy holy sabbath , and commandedst they precept , statute , and law , by the hand of moses thy servant :
and gavest they bread from heaven for they hunger , and broughtest forth water for they out of the rock for they thirst , and promisedst they that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst swear to give they .
but they and we father deal proudly , and harden they neck , and hearken not to thy commandment ,
and refuse to obey , neither be mindful of thy wonder that thou didst among they ; but harden they neck , and in they rebellion appoint a captain to return to they bondage : but thou art a god ready to pardon , gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and forsookest they not .
yea , when they have make they a molten calf , and say , this be thy god that bring thee up out of egypt , and have work great provocation ;
yet thou in thy manifold mercy forsookest they not in the wilderness : the pillar of the cloud depart not from they by day , to lead they in the way ; neither the pillar of fire by night , to shew they light , and the way wherein they should go .
thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct they , and withheldest not thy manna from they mouth , and gavest they water for they thirst .
yea , forty year didst thou sustain they in the wilderness , so that they lack nothing ; they clothes wax not old , and they foot swell not .
moreover thou gavest they kingdom and nation , and didst divide they into corner : so they possess the land of sihon , and the land of the king of heshbon , and the land of og king of bashan .
they child also multipliedst thou as the star of heaven , and broughtest they into the land , concern which thou hadst promise to they father , that they should go in to possess it .
so the child go in and possess the land , and thou subduedst before they the inhabitant of the land , the canaanites , and gavest they into they hand , with they king , and the people of the land , that they might do with they as they would .
and they take strong city , and a fat land , and possess house full of all goods , well dig , vineyard , and oliveyard , and fruit tree in abundance : so they do eat , and be fill , and become fat , and delighted themselves in thy great goodness .
nevertheless they be disobedient , and rebel against thee , and cast thy law behind they back , and slew thy prophet which testify against they to turn they to thee , and they work great provocation .
therefore thou deliveredst they into the hand of they enemy , who vex they : and in the time of they trouble , when they cry unto thee , thou heardest they from heaven ; and accord to thy manifold mercy thou gavest they saviours , who save they out of the hand of they enemy .
but after they have rest , they do evil again before thee : therefore leftest thou they in the hand of they enemy , so that they have the dominion over they : yet when they return , and cry unto thee , thou heardest they from heaven ; and many time do thou deliver they accord to thy mercy ;
and testifiedst against they , that thou mightest bring they again unto thy law : yet they deal proudly , and hearken not unto thy commandment , but sin against thy judgment , ( which if a man do , he shall live in they ; ) and withdraw the shoulder , and harden they neck , and would not hear .
yet many year do thou forbear they , and testifiedst against they by thy spirit in thy prophet : yet would they not give ear : therefore gavest thou they into the hand of the people of the land .
nevertheless for thy great mercy ' sake thou didst not utterly consume they , nor forsake they ; for thou art a gracious and merciful god .
now therefore , we god , the great , the mighty , and the terrible god , who keepest covenant and mercy , let not all the trouble seem little before thee , that have come upon we , on we king , on we prince , and on we priest , and on we prophet , and on we father , and on all thy people , since the time of the king of assyria unto this day .
howbeit thou art just in all that be bring upon we ; for thou hast do right , but we have do wickedly :
neither have we king , we prince , we priest , nor we father , keep thy law , nor hearken unto thy commandment and thy testimony , wherewith thou didst testify against they .
for they have not serve thee in they kingdom , and in thy great goodness that thou gavest they , and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before they , neither turn they from they wicked work .
behold , we be servant this day , and for the land that thou gavest unto we father to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof , behold , we be servant in it :
and it yieldeth much increase unto the king whom thou hast set over we because of we sin : also they have dominion over we body , and over we cattle , at they pleasure , and we be in great distress .

these be in the day of joiakim the son of jeshua , the son of jozadak , and in the day of nehemiah the governor , and of ezra the priest , the scribe .
and at the dedication of the wall of jerusalem they seek the levites out of all they place , to bring they to jerusalem , to keep the dedication with gladness , both with thanksgiving , and with singing , with cymbal , psaltery , and with harp .
and the son of the singer gather themselves together , both out of the plain country round about jerusalem , and from the village of netophathi ;
also from the house of gilgal , and out of the field of geba and azmaveth : for the singer have build they village round about jerusalem .
and the priest and the levites purify themselves , and purify the people , and the gate , and the wall .
then i bring up the prince of judah upon the wall , and appoint two great company of they that give thanks , whereof one go on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate :
and after they go hoshaiah , and half of the prince of judah ,
and azariah , ezra , and meshullam ,

and at the fountain gate , which be over against they , they go up by the stair of the city of david , at the go up of the wall , above the house of david , even unto the water gate eastward .
and the other company of they that give thanks go over against they , and i after they , and the half of the people upon the wall , from beyond the tower of the furnace even unto the broad wall ;
and from above the gate of ephraim , and above the old gate , and above the fish gate , and the tower of hananeel , and the tower of meah , even unto the sheep gate : and they stand still in the prison gate .

and the priest ; eliakim , maaseiah , miniamin , michaiah , elioenai , zechariah , and hananiah , with trumpet ;
and maaseiah , and shemaiah , and eleazar , and uzzi , and jehohanan , and malchijah , and elam , and ezer .
and the singer sing loud , with jezrahiah they overseer .
also that day they offer great sacrifice , and rejoice : for god have make they rejoice with great joy : the wife also and the child rejoice : so that the joy of jerusalem be hear even afar off .
and at that time be some appoint over the chamber for the treasure , for the offering , for the firstfruit , and for the tithe , to gather into they out of the field of the city the portion of the law for the priest and levites : for judah rejoice for the priest and for the levites that wait .
and both the singer and the porter keep the ward of they god , and the ward of the purification , accord to the commandment of david , and of solomon he son .
for in the day of david and asaph of old there be chief of the singer , and song of praise and thanksgiving unto god .
and all israel in the day of zerubbabel , and in the day of nehemiah , give the portion of the singer and the porter , every day he portion : and they sanctify holy thing unto the levites ; and the levites sanctify they unto the child of aaron .
on that day they read in the book of moses in the audience of the people ; and therein be find write , that the ammonite and the moabite should not come into the congregation of god for ever ;
because they meet not the child of israel with bread and with water , but hire balaam against they , that he should curse they : howbeit we god turn the curse into a blessing .
now it come to pass , when they have hear the law , that they separate from israel all the mixed multitude .
and before this , eliashib the priest , have the oversight of the chamber of the house of we god , be ally unto tobiah :
and he have prepare for he a great chamber , where aforetime they lay the meat offering , the frankincense , and the vessel , and the tithe of the corn , the new wine , and the oil , which be command to be give to the levites , and the singer , and the porter ; and the offering of the priest .
but in all this time be not i at jerusalem : for in the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon come i unto the king , and after certain day obtain i leave of the king :
and i come to jerusalem , and understand of the evil that eliashib do for tobiah , in prepare he a chamber in the court of the house of god .
and it grieve i sore : therefore i cast forth all the household stuff of tobiah out of the chamber .
then i command , and they cleanse the chamber : and thither bring i again the vessel of the house of god , with the meat offering and the frankincense .
and i perceive that the portion of the levites have not be give they : for the levites and the singer , that do the work , be flee every one to he field .
then contend i with the ruler , and say , why be the house of god forsake ?
and i gather they together , and set they in they place .
then bring all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasury .
and i make treasurer over the treasury , shelemiah the priest , and zadok the scribe , and of the levites , pedaiah : and next to they be hanan the son of zaccur , the son of mattaniah : for they be count faithful , and they office be to distribute unto they brethren .
remember i , o my god , concern this , and wipe not out my good deed that i have do for the house of my god , and for the office thereof .
in those day see i in judah some tread wine press on the sabbath , and bring in sheaf , and lade ass ; as also wine , grape , and fig , and all manner of burden , which they bring into jerusalem on the sabbath day : and i testify against they in the day wherein they sell victuals .
there dwell man of tyre also therein , which bring fish , and all manner of ware , and sell on the sabbath unto the child of judah , and in jerusalem .
then i contend with the noble of judah , and say unto they , what evil thing be this that ye do , and profane the sabbath day ?
do not you father thus , and do not we god bring all this evil upon we , and upon this city ? yet ye bring more wrath upon israel by profane the sabbath .
and it come to pass , that when the gate of jerusalem begin to be dark before the sabbath , i command that the gate should be shut , and charge that they should not be open till after the sabbath : and some of my servant set i at the gate , that there should no burden be bring in on the sabbath day .
so the merchant and seller of all kind of ware lodge without jerusalem once or twice .
then i testify against they , and say unto they , why lodge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , i will lay hand on you .
from that time forth come they no more on the sabbath .
and i command the levites that they should cleanse themselves , and that they should come and keep the gate , to sanctify the sabbath day .
remember i , o my god , concern this also , and spare i accord to the greatness of thy mercy .
in those day also see i jews that have marry wife of ashdod , of ammon , and of moab :
and they child speak half in the speech of ashdod , and could not speak in the jews ' language , but accord to the language of each people .
and i contend with they , and curse they , and smite certain of they , and pluck off they hair , and make they swear by god , say , ye shall not give you daughter unto they son , nor take they daughter unto you son , or for yourselve .
do not solomon king of israel sin by these thing ? yet among many nation be there no king like he , who be beloved of he god , and god make he king over all israel : nevertheless even he do outlandish woman cause to sin .
shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil , to transgress against we god in marry strange wife ?
and one of the son of joiada , the son of eliashib the high priest , be son in law to sanballat the horonite : therefore i chase he from i .
remember they , o my god , because they have defile the priesthood , and the covenant of the priesthood , and of the levites .
thus cleansed i they from all stranger , and appoint the ward of the priest and the levites , every one in he business ;
and for the wood offering , at time appoint , and for the firstfruit .
remember i , o my god , for good .
now it come to pass in the day of ahasuerus , ( this be ahasuerus which reign , from india even unto ethiopia , over a hundred and seven and twenty province : )
that in those day , when the king ahasuerus sit on the throne of he kingdom , which be in shushan the palace ,
in the third year of he reign , he make a feast unto all he prince and he servant ; the power of persia and media , the noble and prince of the province , be before he :
when he shew the riches of he glorious kingdom and the honour of he excellent majesty many day , even a hundred and fourscore day .
and when these day be expire , the king make a feast unto all the people that be present in shushan the palace , both unto great and small , seven day , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace ;
where be white , green , and blue , hanging , fasten with cord of fine linen and purple to silver ring and pillar of marble : the bed be of gold and silver , upon a pavement of red , and blue , and white , and black , marble .
and they give they drink in vessel of gold , ( the vessel be diverse one from another , ) and royal wine in abundance , accord to the state of the king .
and the drinking be accord to the law ; none do compel : for so the king have appoint to all the officer of he house , that they should do accord to every man 's pleasure .
also vashti the queen make a feast for the woman in the royal house which belong to king ahasuerus .
on the seventh day , when the heart of the king be merry with wine , he command mehuman , biztha , harbona , bigtha , and abagtha , zethar , and carcas , the seven chamberlain that serve in the presence of ahasuerus the king ,
to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal , to shew the people and the prince she beauty : for she be fair to look on .
but the queen vashti refuse to come at the king 's commandment by he chamberlain : therefore be the king very wroth , and he anger burn in he .
then the king say to the wise man , which know the time , ( for so be the king 's manner toward all that know law and judgment :
and the next unto he be carshena , shethar , admatha , tarshish , meres , marsena , and memucan , the seven prince of persia and media , which see the king 's face , and which sit the first in the kingdom ; )
what shall we do unto the queen vashti accord to law , because she have not perform the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlain ?
and memucan answer before the king and the prince , vashti the queen have not do wrong to the king only , but also to all the prince , and to all the people that be in all the province of the king ahasuerus .
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all woman , so that they shall despise they husband in they eye , when it shall be report , the king ahasuerus command vashti the queen to be bring in before he , but she come not .
likewise shall the lady of persia and media say this day unto all the king 's prince , which have hear of the deed of the queen .
thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath .
if it please the king , let there go a royal commandment from he , and let it be write among the law of the persians and the medes , that it be not alter , that vashti come no more before king ahasuerus ; and let the king give she royal estate unto another that be better than she .
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be publish throughout all he empire , ( for it be great , ) all the wife shall give to they husband honour , both to great and small .
and the say pleased the king and the prince ; and the king do accord to the word of memucan :
for he send letter into all the king 's province , into every province accord to the write thereof , and to every people after they language , that every man should bear rule in he own house , and that it should be publish accord to the language of every people .
after these thing , when the wrath of king ahasuerus be appease , he remember vashti , and what she have do , and what be decree against she .
then say the king 's servant that minister unto he , let there be fair young virgin seek for the king :
and let the king appoint officer in all the province of he kingdom , that they may gather together all the fair young virgin unto shushan the palace , to the house of the woman , unto the custody of hege the king 's chamberlain , keeper of the woman ; and let they thing for purification be give they :
and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti .
and the thing please the king ; and he do so .
now in shushan the palace there be a certain jew , whose name be mordecai , the son of jair , the son of shimei , the son of kish , a benjamite ;
who have be carry away from jerusalem with the captivity which have be carry away with jeconiah king of judah , whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon have carry away .
and he bring up hadassah , that be , esther , he uncle 's daughter : for she have neither father nor mother , and the maid be fair and beautiful ; whom mordecai , when she father and mother be dead , take for he own daughter .
so it come to pass , when the king 's commandment and he decree be hear , and when many maiden be gather together unto shushan the palace , to the custody of hegai , that esther be bring also unto the king 's house , to the custody of hegai , keeper of the woman .
and the maiden pleased he , and she obtain kindness of he ; and he speedily give she she thing for purification , with such thing as belong to she , and seven maiden , which be meet to be give she , out of the king 's house : and he prefer she and she maid unto the best place of the house of the woman .
esther have not shew she people nor she kindred : for mordecai have charge she that she should not shew it .
and mordecai walk every day before the court of the woman 's house , to know how esther do , and what should become of she .
now when every maid 's turn be come to go in to king ahasuerus , after that she have be twelve month , accord to the manner of the woman , ( for so be the day of they purification accomplish , to wit , six month with oil of myrrh , and six month with sweet odour , and with other thing for the purifying of the woman ; )
then thus come every maiden unto the king ; whatsoever she desire be give she to go with she out of the house of the woman unto the king 's house .
in the evening she go , and on the morrow she return into the second house of the woman , to the custody of shaashgaz , the king 's chamberlain , which keep the concubine : she come in unto the king no more , except the king delighted in she , and that she be call by name .
now when the turn of esther , the daughter of abihail the uncle of mordecai , who have take she for he daughter , be come to go in unto the king , she require nothing but what hegai the king 's chamberlain , the keeper of the woman , appoint .
and esther obtain favour in the sight of all they that look upon she .
so esther be take unto king ahasuerus into he house royal in the tenth month , which be the month tebeth , in the seventh year of he reign .
and the king love esther above all the woman , and she obtain grace and favour in he sight more than all the virgin ; so that he set the royal crown upon she head , and make she queen instead of vashti .
then the king make a great feast unto all he prince and he servant , even esther 's feast ; and he make a release to the province , and give gift , accord to the state of the king .
and when the virgin be gather together the second time , then mordecai sit in the king 's gate .
esther have not yet shew she kindred nor she people ; as mordecai have charge she : for esther do the commandment of mordecai , like as when she be bring up with he .
in those day , while mordecai sit in the king 's gate , two of the king 's chamberlain , bigthan and teresh , of those which keep the door , be wroth , and seek to lay hand on the king ahasuerus .
and the thing be know to mordecai , who tell it unto esther the queen ; and esther certify the king thereof in mordecai 's name .
and when inquisition be make of the matter , it be find out ; therefore they be both hang on a tree : and it be write in the book of the chronicle before the king .
after these thing do king ahasuerus promote haman the son of hammedatha the agagite , and advance he , and set he seat above all the prince that be with he .
and all the king 's servant , that be in the king 's gate , bow , and reverence haman : for the king have so command concern he .
but mordecai bow not , nor do he reverence .
then the king 's servant , which be in the king 's gate , say unto mordecai , why transgressest thou the king 's commandment ?
now it come to pass , when they speak daily unto he , and he hearken not unto they , that they tell haman , to see whether mordecai 's matter would stand : for he have tell they that he be a jew .
and when haman see that mordecai bow not , nor do he reverence , then be haman full of wrath .
and he think scorn to lay hand on mordecai alone ; for they have shew he the people of mordecai : wherefore haman seek to destroy all the jews that be throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus , even the people of mordecai .
in the first month , that be , the month nisan , in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus , they cast pur , that be , the lot , before haman from day to day , and from month to month , to the twelfth month , that be , the month adar .
and haman say unto king ahasuerus , there be a certain people scatter abroad and disperse among the people in all the province of thy kingdom ; and they law be diverse from all people ; neither keep they the king 's law : therefore it be not for the king 's profit to suffer they .
if it please the king , let it be write that they may be destroy : and i will pay ten thousand talent of silver to the hand of those that have the charge of the business , to bring it into the king 's treasury .
and the king take he ring from he hand , and give it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite , the jews ' enemy .
and the king say unto haman , the silver be give to thee , the people also , to do with they as it seemeth good to thee .
then be the king 's scribe call on the thirteenth day of the first month , and there be write accord to all that haman have command unto the king 's lieutenant , and to the governor that be over every province , and to the ruler of every people of every province accord to the write thereof , and to every people after they language ; in the name of king ahasuerus be it write , and seal with the king 's ring .
and the letter be send by post into all the king 's province , to destroy , to kill , and to cause to perish , all jews , both young and old , little child and woman , in one day , even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which be the month adar , and to take the spoil of they for a prey .
the copy of the write for a commandment to be give in every province be publish unto all people , that they should be ready against that day .
the post go out , be hasten by the king 's commandment , and the decree be give in shushan the palace .
and the king and haman sit down to drink ; but the city shushan be perplexed .
when mordecai perceive all that be do , mordecai rent he clothes , and put on sackcloth with ash , and go out into the midst of the city , and cry with a loud and a bitter cry ;
and come even before the king 's gate : for none might enter into the king 's gate clothe with sackcloth .
and in every province , whithersoever the king 's commandment and he decree come , there be great mourning among the jews , and fasting , and weep , and wail ; and many lay in sackcloth and ash .
so esther 's maid and she chamberlain come and tell it she .
then be the queen exceedingly grieve ; and she send raiment to clothe mordecai , and to take away he sackcloth from he : but he receive it not .
then call esther for hatach , one of the king 's chamberlain , whom he have appoint to attend upon she , and give he a commandment to mordecai , to know what it be , and why it be .
so hatach go forth to mordecai unto the street of the city , which be before the king 's gate .
and mordecai tell he of all that have happen unto he , and of the sum of the money that haman have promise to pay to the king 's treasury for the jews , to destroy they .
also he give he the copy of the writing of the decree that be give at shushan to destroy they , to shew it unto esther , and to declare it unto she , and to charge she that she should go in unto the king , to make supplication unto he , and to make request before he for she people .
and hatach come and tell esther the word of mordecai .
again esther spake unto hatach , and give he commandment unto mordecai ;
all the king 's servant , and the people of the king 's province , do know , that whosoever , whether man or woman , shall come unto the king into the inner court , who be not call , there be one law of he to put he to death , except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre , that he may live : but i have not be call to come in unto the king these thirty day .
and they tell to mordecai esther 's word .
then mordecai command to answer esther , think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king 's house , more than all the jews .
for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time , then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place ; but thou and thy father 's house shall be destroy : and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this ?
then esther bid they return mordecai this answer ,
go , gather together all the jews that be present in shushan , and fast ye for i , and neither eat nor drink three day , night or day : i also and my maiden will fast likewise ; and so will i go in unto the king , which be not accord to the law : and if i perish , i perish .
so mordecai go he way , and do accord to all that esther have command he .
now it come to pass on the third day , that esther put on she royal apparel , and stand in the inner court of the king 's house , over against the king 's house : and the king sit upon he royal throne in the royal house , over against the gate of the house .
and it be so , when the king see esther the queen standing in the court , that she obtain favour in he sight : and the king hold out to esther the golden sceptre that be in he hand .
so esther draw near , and touch the top of the sceptre .
then say the king unto she , what wilt thou , queen esther ? and what be thy request ? it shall be even give thee to the half of the kingdom .
and esther answer , if it seem good unto the king , let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepare for he .
then the king say , cause haman to make haste , that he may do as esther have say .
so the king and haman come to the banquet that esther have prepare .
and the king say unto esther at the banquet of wine , what be thy petition ? and it shall be grant thee : and what be thy request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be perform .
then answer esther , and say , my petition and my request be ;
if i have find favour in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition , and to perform my request , let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for they , and i will do to morrow as the king have say .
then go haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart : but when haman see mordecai in the king 's gate , that he stand not up , nor move for he , he be full of indignation against mordecai .
nevertheless haman refrain himself : and when he come home , he send and call for he friend , and zeresh he wife .
and haman tell they of the glory of he riches , and the multitude of he child , and all the thing wherein the king have promote he , and how he have advance he above the prince and servant of the king .
haman say moreover , yea , esther the queen do let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she have prepare but myself ; and to morrow be i invite unto she also with the king .
yet all this availeth i nothing , so long as i see mordecai the jew sit at the king 's gate .
then say zeresh he wife and all he friend unto he , let a gallows be make of fifty cubit high , and to morrow speak thou unto the king that mordecai may be hang thereon : then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet .
and the thing pleased haman ; and he cause the gallows to be make .
on that night could not the king sleep , and he command to bring the book of record of the chronicle ; and they be read before the king .
and it be find write , that mordecai have tell of bigthana and teresh , two of the king 's chamberlain , the keeper of the door , who seek to lay hand on the king ahasuerus .
and the king say , what honour and dignity have be do to mordecai for this ?
then say the king 's servant that minister unto he , there be nothing do for he .
and the king say , who be in the court ?
now haman be come into the outward court of the king 's house , to speak unto the king to hang mordecai on the gallows that he have prepare for he .
and the king 's servant say unto he , behold , haman standeth in the court .
and the king say , let he come in .
so haman come in .
and the king say unto he , what shall be do unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour ?
now haman think in he heart , to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself ?
and haman answer the king , for the man whom the king delighteth to honour ,
let the royal apparel be bring which the king useth to wear , and the horse that the king rideth upon , and the crown royal which be set upon he head :
and let this apparel and horse be deliver to the hand of one of the king 's most noble prince , that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour , and bring he on horseback through the street of the city , and proclaim before he , thus shall it be do to the man whom the king delighteth to honour .
then the king say to haman , make haste , and take the apparel and the horse , as thou hast say , and do even so to mordecai the jew , that sitteth at the king 's gate : let nothing fail of all that thou hast speak .
then take haman the apparel and the horse , and array mordecai , and bring he on horseback through the street of the city , and proclaim before he , thus shall it be do unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour .
and mordecai come again to the king 's gate .
but haman hast to he house mourning , and have he head cover .
and haman tell zeresh he wife and all he friend every thing that have befall he .
then say he wise man and zeresh he wife unto he , if mordecai be of the seed of the jews , before whom thou hast begin to fall , thou shalt not prevail against he , but shalt surely fall before he .
and while they be yet talk with he , come the king 's chamberlain , and hast to bring haman unto the banquet that esther have prepare .
so the king and haman come to banquet with esther the queen .
and the king say again unto esther on the second day at the banquet of wine , what be thy petition , queen esther ? and it shall be grant thee : and what be thy request ? and it shall be perform , even to the half of the kingdom .
then esther the queen answer and say , if i have find favour in thy sight , o king , and if it please the king , let my life be give i at my petition , and my people at my request :
for we be sell , i and my people , to be destroy , to be slay , and to perish .
but if we have be sell for bondman and bondwoman , i have hold my tongue , although the enemy could not countervail the king 's damage .
then the king ahasuerus answer and say unto esther the queen , who be he , and where be he , that durst presume in he heart to do so ?
and esther say , the adversary and enemy be this wicked haman .
then haman be afraid before the king and the queen .
and the king arise from the banquet of wine in he wrath go into the palace garden : and haman stand up to make request for he life to esther the queen ; for he see that there be evil determine against he by the king .
then the king return out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine ; and haman be fall upon the bed whereon esther be .
then say the king , will he force the queen also before i in the house ?
as the word go out of the king 's mouth , they cover haman 's face .
and harbonah , one of the chamberlain , say before the king , behold also , the gallows fifty cubit high , which haman have make for mordecai , who have speak good for the king , standeth in the house of haman .
then the king say , hang he thereon .
so they hang haman on the gallows that he have prepare for mordecai .
then be the king 's wrath pacify .
on that day do the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the jews ' enemy unto esther the queen .
and mordecai come before the king ; for esther have tell what he be unto she .
and the king take off he ring , which he have take from haman , and give it unto mordecai .
and esther set mordecai over the house of haman .
and esther spake yet again before the king , and fall down at he foot , and besought he with tear to put away the mischief of haman the agagite , and he device that he have devise against the jews .
then the king hold out the golden sceptre toward esther .
so esther arise , and stand before the king ,
and say , if it please the king , and if i have find favour in he sight , and the thing seem right before the king , and i be please in he eye , let it be write to reverse the letter devise by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite , which he write to destroy the jews which be in all the king 's province :
for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
then the king ahasuerus say unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew , behold , i have give esther the house of haman , and he they have hang upon the gallows , because he lay he hand upon the jews .
write ye also for the jews , as it liketh you , in the king 's name , and seal it with the king 's ring : for the writing which be write in the king 's name , and seal with the king 's ring , may no man reverse .
then be the king 's scribe call at that time in the third month , that be , the month sivan , on the three and twentieth day thereof ; and it be write accord to all that mordecai command unto the jews , and to the lieutenant , and the deputy and ruler of the province which be from india unto ethiopia , a hundred twenty and seven province , unto every province accord to the write thereof , and unto every people after they language , and to the jews accord to they writing , and accord to they language .
and he write in the king ahasuerus ' name , and seal it with the king 's ring , and send letter by post on horseback , and rider on mule , camel , and young dromedary :
wherein the king grant the jews which be in every city to gather themselves together , and to stand for they life , to destroy , to slay , and to cause to perish , all the power of the people and province that would assault they , both little one and woman , and to take the spoil of they for a prey ,
upon one day in all the province of king ahasuerus , namely , upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which be the month adar .
the copy of the write for a commandment to be give in every province be publish unto all people , and that the jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on they enemy .
so the post that ride upon mule and camel go out , be hasten and press on by the king 's commandment .
and the decree be give at shushan the palace .
and mordecai go out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a garment of fine linen and purple : and the city of shushan rejoice and be glad .
the jews have light , and gladness , and joy , and honour .
and in every province , and in every city , whithersoever the king 's commandment and he decree come , the jews have joy and gladness , a feast and a good day .
and many of the people of the land become jews ; for the fear of the jews fall upon they .
now in the twelfth month , that be , the month adar , on the thirteenth day of the same , when the king 's commandment and he decree draw near to be put in execution , in the day that the enemy of the jews hope to have power over they , ( though it be turn to the contrary , that the jews have rule over they that hate they ; )
the jews gather themselves together in they city throughout all the province of the king ahasuerus , to lay hand on such as seek they hurt : and no man could withstand they ; for the fear of they fall upon all people .
and all the ruler of the province , and the lieutenant , and the deputy , and officer of the king , help the jews ; because the fear of mordecai fall upon they .
for mordecai be great in the king 's house , and he fame go out throughout all the province : for this man mordecai wax greater and greater .
thus the jews smite all they enemy with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and do what they would unto those that hate they .
and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroy five hundred man .
and parshandatha , and dalphon , and aspatha ,
and poratha , and adalia , and aridatha ,
and parmashta , and arisai , and aridai , and vajezatha ,
the ten son of haman the son of hammedatha , the enemy of the jews , slew they ; but on the spoil lay they not they hand .
on that day the number of those that be slay in shushan the palace be bring before the king .
and the king say unto esther the queen , the jews have slay and destroy five hundred man in shushan the palace , and the ten son of haman ; what have they do in the rest of the king 's province ? now what be thy petition ? and it shall be grant thee : or what be thy request further ? and it shall be do .
then say esther , if it please the king , let it be grant to the jews which be in shushan to do to morrow also accord unto this day 's decree , and let haman 's ten son be hang upon the gallows .
and the king command it so to be do : and the decree be give at shushan ; and they hang haman 's ten son .
for the jews that be in shushan gather themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month adar , and slew three hundred man at shushan ; but on the prey they lay not they hand .
but the other jews that be in the king 's province gather themselves together , and stand for they life , and have rest from they enemy , and slew of they foe seventy and five thousand , but they lay not they hand on the prey ,
on the thirteenth day of the month adar ; and on the fourteenth day of the same rest they , and make it a day of feast and gladness .
but the jews that be at shushan assemble together on the thirteenth day thereof , and on the fourteenth thereof ; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rest , and make it a day of feast and gladness .
therefore the jews of the village , that dwelt in the unwalled town , make the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of gladness and feasting , and a good day , and of send portion one to another .
and mordecai write these thing , and send letter unto all the jews that be in all the province of the king ahasuerus , both nigh and far ,
to stablish this among they , that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yearly ,
as the day wherein the jews rest from they enemy , and the month which be turn unto they from sorrow to joy , and from mourn into a good day : that they should make they day of feast and joy , and of send portion one to another , and gift to the poor .
and the jews undertake to do as they have begin , and as mordecai have write unto they ;
because haman the son of hammedatha , the agagite , the enemy of all the jews , have devise against the jews to destroy they , and have cast pur , that be , the lot , to consume they , and to destroy they ;
but when esther come before the king , he command by letter that he wicked device , which he devise against the jews , should return upon he own head , and that he and he son should be hang on the gallows .
wherefore they call these day purim after the name of pur .
therefore for all the word of this letter , and of that which they have see concern this matter , and which have come unto they ,
the jews ordain , and take upon they , and upon they seed , and upon all such as join themselves unto they , so as it should not fail , that they would keep these two day accord to they writing , and accord to they appoint time every year ;
and that these day should be remembered and keep throughout every generation , every family , every province , and every city ; and that these day of purim should not fail from among the jews , nor the memorial of they perish from they seed .
then esther the queen , the daughter of abihail , and mordecai the jew , write with all authority , to confirm this second letter of purim .
and he send the letter unto all the jews , to the hundred twenty and seven province of the kingdom of ahasuerus , with word of peace and truth ,
to confirm these day of purim in they time appoint , accord as mordecai the jew and esther the queen have enjoin they , and as they have decree for themselves and for they seed , the matter of the fasting and they cry .
and the decree of esther confirm these matter of purim ; and it be write in the book .
and the king ahasuerus lay a tribute upon the land , and upon the isle of the sea .
and all the act of he power and of he might , and the declaration of the greatness of mordecai , whereunto the king advance he , be they not write in the book of the chronicle of the king of media and persia ?
for mordecai the jew be next unto king ahasuerus , and great among the jews , and accept of the multitude of he brethren , seek the wealth of he people , and speak peace to all he seed .
there be a man in the land of uz , whose name be job ; and that man be perfect and upright , and one that fear god , and eschew evil .
and there be bear unto he seven son and three daughter .

and it be so , when the day of they feasting be go about , that job send and sanctify they , and rise up early in the morning , and offer burnt offering accord to the number of they all : for job say , it may be that my son have sin , and curse god in they heart .
thus do job continually .

then satan answer the lord , and say , from go to and fro in the earth , and from walk up and down in it .
and the lord say unto satan , hast thou consider my servant job , that there be none like he in the earth , a perfect and a upright man , one that feareth god , and escheweth evil ?
then satan answer the lord , and say , doth job fear god for nought ?
hast not thou make a hedge about he , and about he house , and about all that he have on every side ? thou hast bless the work of he hand , and he substance be increase in the land .
but put forth thine hand now , and touch all that he have , and he will curse thee to thy face .
and the lord say unto satan , behold , all that he have be in thy power ; only upon himself put not forth thine hand .
so satan go forth from the presence of the lord .
and there be a day when he son and he daughter be eat and drink wine in they eldest brother 's house :
and there come a messenger unto job , and say , the ox be plow , and the ass feed beside they :
and the sabeans fall upon they , and take they away ; yea , they have slay the servant with the edge of the sword ; and i only be escape alone to tell thee .
while he be yet speak , there come also another , and say , the fire of god be fall from heaven , and have burn up the sheep , and the servant , and consume they ; and i only be escape alone to tell thee .
while he be yet speak , there come also another , and say , the chaldeans make out three band , and fall upon the camel , and have carry they away , yea , and slay the servant with the edge of the sword ; and i only be escape alone to tell thee .
while he be yet speak , there come also another , and say , thy son and thy daughter be eat and drink wine in they eldest brother 's house :
and , behold , there come a great wind from the wilderness , and smite the four corner of the house , and it fall upon the young man , and they be dead ; and i only be escape alone to tell thee .
then job arise , and rent he mantle , and shave he head , and fall down upon the ground , and worship ,
and say , naked come i out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall i return thither : the lord give , and the lord have take away ; bless be the name of the lord .
in all this job sin not , nor charged god foolishly .
again there be a day when the son of god come to present themselves before the lord , and satan come also among they to present himself before the lord .
and the lord say unto satan , from whence comest thou ?
and satan answer the lord , and say , from go to and fro in the earth , and from walk up and down in it .
and the lord say unto satan , hast thou consider my servant job , that there be none like he in the earth , a perfect and a upright man , one that feareth god , and escheweth evil ? and still he holdeth fast he integrity , although thou movedst i against he , to destroy he without cause .
and satan answer the lord , and say , skin for skin , yea , all that a man have will he give for he life .
but put forth thine hand now , and touch he bone and he flesh , and he will curse thee to thy face .
and the lord say unto satan , behold , he be in thine hand ; but save he life .
so go satan forth from the presence of the lord , and smite job with sore boil from the sole of he foot unto he crown .
and he take he a potsherd to scrape himself withal ; and he sit down among the ash .
then say he wife unto he , dost thou still retain thine integrity ? curse god , and die .
but he say unto she , thou speakest as one of the foolish woman speaketh .
what ? shall we receive good at the hand of god , and shall we not receive evil ?
in all this do not job sin with he lip .
now when job 's three friend hear of all this evil that be come upon he , they come every one from he own place ; eliphaz the temanite , and bildad the shuhite , and zophar the naamathite : for they have make a appointment together to come to mourn with he and to comfort he .
and when they lift up they eye afar off , and know he not , they lift up they voice , and weep ; and they rent every one he mantle , and sprinkle dust upon they head toward heaven .
so they sit down with he upon the ground seven day and seven night , and none speak a word unto he : for they see that he grief be very great .
after this open job he mouth , and curse he day .
and job spake , and say ,
let the day perish wherein i be bear , and the night in which it be say , there be a man child conceive .
let that day be darkness ; let not god regard it from above , neither let the light shine upon it .
let darkness and the shadow of death stain it ; let a cloud dwell upon it ; let the blackness of the day terrify it .
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be join unto the day of the year , let it not come into the number of the month .
lo , let that night be solitary , let no joyful voice come therein .
let they curse it that curse the day , who be ready to raise up they mourning .
let the star of the twilight thereof be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the dawn of the day :
because it shut not up the door of my mother 's womb , nor hide sorrow from mine eye .
why die i not from the womb ? why do i not give up the ghost when i come out of the belly ?
why do the knee prevent i ? or why the breast that i should suck ?
for now should i have lie still and be quiet , i should have sleep : then have i be at rest ,
with king and counsellor of the earth , which build desolate place for themselves ;
or with prince that have gold , who fill they house with silver :
or as a hidden untimely birth i have not be ; as infant which never see light .
there the wicked cease from trouble ; and there the weary be at rest .
there the prisoner rest together ; they hear not the voice of the oppressor .
the small and great be there ; and the servant be free from he master .
wherefore be light give to he that be in misery , and life unto the bitter in soul ;
which long for death , but it cometh not ; and dig for it more than for hide treasure ;
which rejoice exceedingly , and be glad , when they can find the grave ?
why be light give to a man whose way be hide , and whom god have hedge in ?
for my sigh cometh before i eat , and my roaring be pour out like the water .
for the thing which i greatly fear be come upon i , and that which i be afraid of be come unto i .
i be not in safety , neither have i rest , neither be i quiet ; yet trouble come .
then eliphaz the temanite answer and say ,
if we assay to commune with thee , wilt thou be grieve ? but who can withhold himself from speak ?
behold , thou hast instruct many , and thou hast strengthen the weak hand .
thy word have upholden he that be fall , and thou hast strengthen the feeble knee .
but now it be come upon thee , and thou faintest ; it toucheth thee , and thou art trouble .
be not this thy fear , thy confidence , thy hope , and the uprightness of thy way ?
remember , i pray thee , who ever perish , be innocent ? or where be the righteous cut off ?
even as i have see , they that plow iniquity , and sow wickedness , reap the same .
by the blast of god they perish , and by the breath of he nostril be they consume .
the roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , and the tooth of the young lion , be break .
the old lion perisheth for lack of prey , and the stout lion 's whelp be scatter abroad .
now a thing be secretly bring to i , and mine ear receive a little thereof .
in thought from the vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth on man ,
fear come upon i , and tremble , which make all my bone to shake .
then a spirit pass before my face ; the hair of my flesh stand up :
it stand still , but i could not discern the form thereof : a image be before mine eye , there be silence , and i hear a voice , say ,
shall mortal man be more just than god ? shall a man be more pure than he maker ?
behold , he put no trust in he servant ; and he angel he charge with folly :
how much less in they that dwell in house of clay , whose foundation be in the dust , which be crush before the moth ?
they be destroy from morning to evening : they perish for ever without any regard it .
doth not they excellency which be in they go away ? they die , even without wisdom .
call now , if there be any that will answer thee ; and to which of the saint wilt thou turn ?
for wrath killeth the foolish man , and envy slayeth the silly one .
i have see the foolish take root : but suddenly i curse he habitation .
he child be far from safety , and they be crush in the gate , neither be there any to deliver they .
whose harvest the hungry eateth up , and taketh it even out of the thorn , and the robber swalloweth up they substance .
although affliction cometh not forth of the dust , neither doth trouble spring out of the ground ;
yet man be bear unto trouble , as the spark fly upward .
i would seek unto god , and unto god would i commit my cause :
which doeth great thing and unsearchable ; marvellous thing without number :
who giveth rain upon the earth , and sendeth water upon the field :
to set up on high those that be low ; that those which mourn may be exalt to safety .
he disappointeth the device of the crafty , so that they hand can not perform they enterprise .
he taketh the wise in they own craftiness : and the counsel of the froward be carry headlong .
they meet with darkness in the day time , and grope in the noonday as in the night .
but he saveth the poor from the sword , from they mouth , and from the hand of the mighty .
so the poor have hope , and iniquity stoppeth she mouth .
behold , happy be the man whom god correcteth : therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty :
for he maketh sore , and bindeth up : he woundeth , and he hand make whole .
he shall deliver thee in six trouble : yea , in seven there shall no evil touch thee .
in famine he shall redeem thee from death : and in war from the power of the sword .
thou shalt be hide from the scourge of the tongue : neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh .
at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh : neither shalt thou be afraid of the beast of the earth .
for thou shalt be in league with the stone of the field : and the beast of the field shall be at peace with thee .
and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace ; and thou shalt visit thy habitation , and shalt not sin .
thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great , and thine offspring as the grass of the earth .
thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age , like as a shock of corn cometh in in he season .
lo this , we have search it , so it be ; hear it , and know thou it for thy good .
but job answer and say ,
oh that my grief be throughly weigh , and my calamity lay in the balance together !
for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea : therefore my word be swallow up .
for the arrow of the almighty be within i , the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit : the terror of god do set themselves in array against i .
doth the wild ass bray when he have grass ? or loweth the ox over he fodder ?
can that which be unsavoury be eat without salt ? or be there any taste in the white of a egg ?
the thing that my soul refuse to touch be as my sorrowful meat .
oh that i might have my request ; and that god would grant i the thing that i long for !
even that it would please god to destroy i ; that he would let loose he hand , and cut i off !
then should i yet have comfort ; yea , i would harden myself in sorrow : let he not spare ; for i have not conceal the word of the holy one .
what be my strength , that i should hope ? and what be mine end , that i should prolong my life ?
be my strength the strength of stone ? or be my flesh of brass ?
be not my help in i ? and be wisdom drive quite from i ?
to he that be afflict pity should be shew from he friend ; but he forsaketh the fear of the almighty .
my brethren have deal deceitfully as a brook , and as the stream of brook they pass away ;
which be blackish by reason of the ice , and wherein the snow be hide :
what time they wax warm , they vanish : when it be hot , they be consume out of they place .
the path of they way be turn aside ; they go to nothing , and perish .
the troops of tema look , the company of sheba wait for they .
they be confound because they have hope ; they come thither , and be ashamed .
for now ye be nothing ; ye see my cast down , and be afraid .
do i say , bring unto i ? or , give a reward for i of you substance ?
or , deliver i from the enemy 's hand ? or , redeem i from the hand of the mighty ?
teach i , and i will hold my tongue : and cause i to understand wherein i have err .
how forcible be right word ! but what doth you argue reprove ?
do ye imagine to reprove word , and the speech of one that be desperate , which be as wind ?
yea , ye overwhelm the fatherless , and ye dig a pit for you friend .
now therefore be content , look upon i ; for it be evident unto you if i lie .
return , i pray you , let it not be iniquity ; yea , return again , my righteousness be in it .
be there iniquity in my tongue ? can not my taste discern perverse thing ?
be there not a appoint time to man upon earth ? be not he day also like the day of a hireling ?
as a servant earnestly desireth the shadow , and as a hireling looketh for the reward of he work :
so be i make to possess month of vanity , and wearisome night be appoint to i .
when i lie down , i say , when shall i arise , and the night be go ? and i be full of tossing to and fro unto the dawn of the day .
my flesh be clothe with worm and clod of dust ; my skin be break , and become loathsome .
my day be swifter than a weaver 's shuttle , and be spend without hope .
o remember that my life be wind : mine eye shall no more see good .
the eye of he that have see i shall see i no more : thine eye be upon i , and i be not .
as the cloud be consume and vanisheth away : so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more .
he shall return no more to he house , neither shall he place know he any more .
therefore i will not refrain my mouth ; i will speak in the anguish of my spirit ; i will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
be i a sea , or a whale , that thou settest a watch over i ?
when i say , my bed shall comfort i , my couch shall ease my complaint ;
then thou scarest i with dream , and terrifiest i through vision :
so that my soul chooseth strangling , and death rather than my life .
i loathe it ; i would not live alway : let i alone ; for my day be vanity .
what be man , that thou shouldest magnify he ? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon he ?
and that thou shouldest visit he every morning , and try he every moment ?
how long wilt thou not depart from i , nor let i alone till i swallow down my spittle ?
i have sin ; what shall i do unto thee , o thou preserver of man ? why hast thou set i as a mark against thee , so that i be a burden to myself ?
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ? for now shall i sleep in the dust ; and thou shalt seek i in the morning , but i shall not be .
then answer bildad the shuhite , and say ,
how long wilt thou speak these thing ? and how long shall the word of thy mouth be like a strong wind ?
doth god pervert judgment ? or doth the almighty pervert justice ?
if thy child have sin against he , and he have cast they away for they transgression ;
if thou wouldest seek unto god betime , and make thy supplication to the almighty ;
if thou wert pure and upright ; surely now he would awake for thee , and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous .
though thy beginning be small , yet thy latter end should greatly increase .
for enquire , i pray thee , of the former age , and prepare thyself to the search of they father :
( for we be but of yesterday , and know nothing , because we day upon earth be a shadow : )
shall not they teach thee , and tell thee , and utter word out of they heart ?
can the rush grow up without mire ? can the flag grow without water ?
whilst it be yet in he greenness , and not cut down , it withereth before any other herb .
so be the path of all that forget god ; and the hypocrite 's hope shall perish :
whose hope shall be cut off , and whose trust shall be a spider 's web .
he shall lean upon he house , but it shall not stand : he shall hold it fast , but it shall not endure .
he be green before the sun , and he branch shooteth forth in he garden .
he root be wrap about the heap , and seeth the place of stone .
if he destroy he from he place , then it shall deny he , say , i have not see thee .
behold , this be the joy of he way , and out of the earth shall other grow .
behold , god will not cast away a perfect man , neither will he help the evil doer :
till he fill thy mouth with laughing , and thy lip with rejoice .
they that hate thee shall be clothe with shame ; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought .
then job answer and say ,
i know it be so of a truth : but how should man be just with god ?
if he will contend with he , he can not answer he one of a thousand .
he be wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who have harden himself against he , and have prosper ?
which removeth the mountain , and they know not : which overturneth they in he anger .
which shaketh the earth out of she place , and the pillar thereof tremble .
which commandeth the sun , and it riseth not ; and sealeth up the star .
which alone spreadeth out the heaven , and treadeth upon the wave of the sea .
which maketh arcturus , orion , and pleiades , and the chamber of the south .
which doeth great thing past find out ; yea , and wonder without number .
lo , he goeth by i , and i see he not : he passeth on also , but i perceive he not .
behold , he taketh away , who can hinder he ? who will say unto he , what doest thou ?
if god will not withdraw he anger , the proud helper do stoop under he .
how much less shall i answer he , and choose out my word to reason with he ?
whom , though i be righteous , yet would i not answer , but i would make supplication to my judge .
if i have call , and he have answer i ; yet would i not believe that he have hearken unto my voice .
for he breaketh i with a tempest , and multiplieth my wound without cause .
he will not suffer i to take my breath , but filleth i with bitterness .
if i speak of strength , lo , he be strong : and if of judgment , who shall set i a time to plead ?
if i justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn i : if i say , i be perfect , it shall also prove i perverse .
though i be perfect , yet would i not know my soul : i would despise my life .
this be one thing , therefore i say it , he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked .
if the scourge slay suddenly , he will laugh at the trial of the innocent .
the earth be give into the hand of the wicked : he covereth the face of the judge thereof ; if not , where , and who be he ?
now my day be swifter than a post : they flee away , they see no good .
they be pass away as the swift ship : as the eagle that hasteth to the prey .
if i say , i will forget my complaint , i will leave off my heaviness , and comfort myself :
i be afraid of all my sorrow , i know that thou wilt not hold i innocent .
if i be wicked , why then labour i in vain ?
if i wash myself with snow water , and make my hand never so clean ;
yet shalt thou plunge i in the ditch , and mine own clothes shall abhor i .
for he be not a man , as i be , that i should answer he , and we should come together in judgment .
neither be there any daysman betwixt we , that might lay he hand upon we both .
let he take he rod away from i , and let not he fear terrify i :
then would i speak , and not fear he ; but it be not so with i .
my soul be weary of my life ; i will leave my complaint upon myself ; i will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
i will say unto god , do not condemn i ; shew i wherefore thou contendest with i .
be it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress , that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hand , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
hast thou eye of flesh ? or seest thou as man seeth ?
be thy day as the day of man ? be thy year as man 's day ,
that thou enquirest after mine iniquity , and searchest after my sin ?
thou knowest that i be not wicked ; and there be none that can deliver out of thine hand .
thine hand have make i and fashion i together round about ; yet thou dost destroy i .
remember , i beseech thee , that thou hast make i as the clay ; and wilt thou bring i into dust again ?
hast thou not pour i out as milk , and curdle i like cheese ?
thou hast clothe i with skin and flesh , and hast fence i with bone and sinew .
thou hast grant i life and favour , and thy visitation have preserved my spirit .
and these thing hast thou hide in thine heart : i know that this be with thee .
if i sin , then thou markest i , and thou wilt not acquit i from mine iniquity .
if i be wicked , woe unto i ; and if i be righteous , yet will i not lift up my head .
i be full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine affliction ;
for it increaseth .
thou huntest i as a fierce lion : and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon i .
thou renewest thy witness against i , and increasest thine indignation upon i ; change and war be against i .
wherefore then hast thou bring i forth out of the womb ?
oh that i have give up the ghost , and no eye have see i !
i should have be as though i have not be ; i should have be carry from the womb to the grave .
be not my day few ? cease then , and let i alone , that i may take comfort a little ,
before i go whence i shall not return , even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death ;
a land of darkness , as darkness itself ; and of the shadow of death , without any order , and where the light be as darkness .
then answer zophar the naamathite , and say ,
should not the multitude of word be answer ? and should a man full of talk be justify ?
should thy lie make man hold they peace ? and when thou mockest , shall no man make thee ashamed ?
for thou hast say , my doctrine be pure , and i be clean in thine eye .
but oh that god would speak , and open he lip against thee ;
and that he would shew thee the secret of wisdom , that they be double to that which be !
know therefore that god exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth .
canst thou by search find out god ? canst thou find out the almighty unto perfection ?
it be as high as heaven ; what canst thou do ? deeper than hell ; what canst thou know ?
the measure thereof be longer than the earth , and broader than the sea .
if he cut off , and shut up , or gather together , then who can hinder he ?
for he knoweth vain man : he seeth wickedness also ; will he not then consider it ?
for vain man would be wise , though man be bear like a wild ass 's colt .
if thou prepare thine heart , and stretch out thine hand toward he ;
if iniquity be in thine hand , put it far away , and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacle .
for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot ; yea , thou shalt be stedfast , and shalt not fear :
because thou shalt forget thy misery , and remember it as water that pass away :
and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday : thou shalt shine forth , thou shalt be as the morning .
and thou shalt be secure , because there be hope ; yea , thou shalt dig about thee , and thou shalt take thy rest in safety .
also thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ; yea , many shall make suit unto thee .
but the eye of the wicked shall fail , and they shall not escape , and they hope shall be as the give up of the ghost .
and job answer and say ,
no doubt but ye be the people , and wisdom shall die with you .
but i have understand as well as you ; i be not inferior to you : yea , who knoweth not such thing as these ?
i be as one mock of he neighbour , who calleth upon god , and he answereth he : the just upright man be laugh to scorn .
he that be ready to slip with he foot be as a lamp despise in the thought of he that be at ease .
the tabernacle of robber prosper , and they that provoke god be secure ; into whose hand god bringeth abundantly .
but ask now the beast , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowl of the air , and they shall tell thee :
or speak to the earth , and it shall teach thee : and the fish of the sea shall declare unto thee .
who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord have work this ?
in whose hand be the soul of every living thing , and the breath of all mankind .
doth not the ear try word ? and the mouth taste he meat ?
with the ancient be wisdom ; and in length of day understand .
with he be wisdom and strength , he have counsel and understanding .
behold , he breaketh down , and it can not be build again : he shutteth up a man , and there can be no opening .
behold , he withholdeth the water , and they dry up : also he sendeth they out , and they overturn the earth .
with he be strength and wisdom : the deceive and the deceiver be he .
he leadeth counsellor away spoil , and maketh the judge fool .
he looseth the bond of king , and girdeth they loin with a girdle .
he leadeth prince away spoil , and overthroweth the mighty .
he removeth away the speech of the trusty , and taketh away the understanding of the aged .
he poureth contempt upon prince , and weakeneth the strength of the mighty .
he discovereth deep thing out of darkness , and bringeth out to light the shadow of death .
he increaseth the nation , and destroyeth they : he enlargeth the nation , and straiteneth they again .
he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth , and causeth they to wander in a wilderness where there be no way .
they grope in the dark without light , and he maketh they to stagger like a drunken man .
lo , mine eye have see all this , mine ear have hear and understand it .
what ye know , the same do i know also : i be not inferior unto you .
surely i would speak to the almighty , and i desire to reason with god .
but ye be forger of lie , ye be all physician of no value .
o that ye would altogether hold you peace ! and it should be you wisdom .
hear now my reasoning , and hearken to the pleading of my lip .
will ye speak wickedly for god ? and talk deceitfully for he ?
will ye accept he person ? will ye contend for god ?
be it good that he should search you out ? or as one man mocketh another , do ye so mock he ?
he will surely reprove you , if ye do secretly accept person .
shall not he excellency make you afraid ? and he dread fall upon you ?
you remembrance be like unto ash , you body to body of clay .
hold you peace , let i alone , that i may speak , and let come on i what will .
wherefore do i take my flesh in my tooth , and put my life in mine hand ?
though he slay i , yet will i trust in he : but i will maintain mine own way before he .
he also shall be my salvation : for a hypocrite shall not come before he .
hear diligently my speech , and my declaration with you ear .
behold now , i have order my cause ; i know that i shall be justified .
who be he that will plead with i ? for now , if i hold my tongue , i shall give up the ghost .
only do not two thing unto i : then will i not hide myself from thee .
withdraw thine hand far from i : and let not thy dread make i afraid .
then call thou , and i will answer : or let i speak , and answer thou i .
how many be mine iniquity and sin ? make i to know my transgression and my sin .
wherefore hidest thou thy face , and holdest i for thine enemy ?
wilt thou break a leaf drive to and fro ? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble ?
for thou writest bitter thing against i , and makest i to possess the iniquity of my youth .
thou puttest my foot also in the stock , and lookest narrowly unto all my path ; thou settest a print upon the heel of my foot .
and he , as a rotten thing , consumeth , as a garment that be moth eat .
man that be bear of a woman be of few day , and full of trouble .
he cometh forth like a flower , and be cut down : he fleeth also as a shadow , and continueth not .
and dost thou open thine eye upon such a one , and bringest i into judgment with thee ?
who can bring a clean thing out of a unclean ? not one .
see he day be determine , the number of he month be with thee , thou hast appoint he bound that he can not pass ;
turn from he , that he may rest , till he shall accomplish , as a hireling , he day .
for there be hope of a tree , if it be cut down , that it will sprout again , and that the tender branch thereof will not cease .
though the root thereof wax old in the earth , and the stock thereof die in the ground ;
yet through the scent of water it will bud , and bring forth bough like a plant .
but man dieth , and wasteth away : yea , man giveth up the ghost , and where be he ?
as the water fail from the sea , and the flood decayeth and drieth up :
so man lieth down , and riseth not : till the heaven be no more , they shall not awake , nor be raise out of they sleep .
o that thou wouldest hide i in the grave , that thou wouldest keep i secret , until thy wrath be past , that thou wouldest appoint i a set time , and remember i !
if a man die , shall he live again ? all the day of my appoint time will i wait , till my change come .
thou shalt call , and i will answer thee : thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hand .
for now thou numberest my step : dost thou not watch over my sin ?
my transgression be seal up in a bag , and thou sewest up mine iniquity .
and surely the mountain fall cometh to nought , and the rock be remove out of he place .
the water wear the stone : thou washest away the thing which grow out of the dust of the earth ; and thou destroyest the hope of man .
thou prevailest for ever against he , and he passeth : thou changest he countenance , and sendest he away .
he son come to honour , and he knoweth it not ; and they be bring low , but he perceiveth it not of they .
but he flesh upon he shall have pain , and he soul within he shall mourn .
then answer eliphaz the temanite , and say ,
should a wise man utter vain knowledge , and fill he belly with the east wind ?
should he reason with unprofitable talk ? or with speech wherewith he can do no good ?
yea , thou castest off fear , and restrainest prayer before god .
for thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity , and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty .
thine own mouth condemneth thee , and not i : yea , thine own lip testify against thee .
art thou the first man that be bear ? or wast thou make before the hill ?
hast thou hear the secret of god ? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself ?
what knowest thou , that we know not ? what understandest thou , which be not in we ?
with we be both the grayhead and very aged man , much elder than thy father .
be the consolation of god small with thee ? be there any secret thing with thee ?
why doth thine heart carry thee away ? and what do thy eye wink at ,
that thou turnest thy spirit against god , and lettest such word go out of thy mouth ?
what be man , that he should be clean ? and he which be bear of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
behold , he putteth no trust in he saint ; yea , the heaven be not clean in he sight .
how much more abominable and filthy be man , which drinketh iniquity like water ?
i will shew thee , hear i ; and that which i have see i will declare ;
which wise man have tell from they father , and have not hide it :
unto whom alone the earth be give , and no stranger pass among they .
the wicked man travaileth with pain all he day , and the number of year be hide to the oppressor .
a dreadful sound be in he ear : in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon he .
he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness , and he be wait for of the sword .
he wandereth abroad for bread , say , where be it ? he knoweth that the day of darkness be ready at he hand .
trouble and anguish shall make he afraid ; they shall prevail against he , as a king ready to the battle .
for he stretcheth out he hand against god , and strengtheneth himself against the almighty .
he runneth upon he , even on he neck , upon the thick boss of he buckler :
because he covereth he face with he fatness , and maketh collop of fat on he flank .
and he dwelleth in desolate city , and in house which no man inhabiteth , which be ready to become heap .
he shall not be rich , neither shall he substance continue , neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth .
he shall not depart out of darkness ; the flame shall dry up he branch , and by the breath of he mouth shall he go away .
let not he that be deceive trust in vanity : for vanity shall be he recompence .
it shall be accomplish before he time , and he branch shall not be green .
he shall shake off he unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off he flower as the olive .
for the congregation of hypocrite shall be desolate , and fire shall consume the tabernacle of bribery .
they conceive mischief , and bring forth vanity , and they belly prepareth deceit .
then job answer and say ,
i have hear many such thing : miserable comforter be ye all .
shall vain word have a end ? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest ?
i also could speak as ye do : if you soul be in my soul 's stead , i could heap up word against you , and shake mine head at you .
but i would strengthen you with my mouth , and the moving of my lip should asswage you grief .
though i speak , my grief be not asswage : and though i forbear , what be i ease ?
but now he have make i weary : thou hast make desolate all my company .
and thou hast fill i with wrinkle , which be a witness against i : and my leanness rise up in i beareth witness to my face .
he teareth i in he wrath , who hateth i : he gnasheth upon i with he tooth ; mine enemy sharpeneth he eye upon i .
they have gape upon i with they mouth ; they have smite i upon the cheek reproachfully ; they have gather themselves together against i .
god have deliver i to the ungodly , and turn i over into the hand of the wicked .
i be at ease , but he have broken i asunder : he have also take i by my neck , and shake i to piece , and set i up for he mark .
he archer compass i round about , he cleaveth my rein asunder , and doth not spare ; he poureth out my gall upon the ground .
he breaketh i with breach upon breach , he runneth upon i like a giant .
i have sew sackcloth upon my skin , and defile my horn in the dust .
my face be foul with weep , and on my eyelid be the shadow of death ;
not for any injustice in mine hand : also my prayer be pure .
o earth , cover not thou my blood , and let my cry have no place .
also now , behold , my witness be in heaven , and my record be on high .
my friend scorn i : but mine eye poureth out tear unto god .
o that one might plead for a man with god , as a man pleadeth for he neighbour !
when a few year be come , then i shall go the way whence i shall not return .
my breath be corrupt , my day be extinct , the grave be ready for i .
be there not mocker with i ? and doth not mine eye continue in they provocation ?
lay down now , put i in a surety with thee ; who be he that will strike hand with i ?
for thou hast hide they heart from understanding : therefore shalt thou not exalt they .
he that speaketh flattery to he friend , even the eye of he child shall fail .
he have make i also a byword of the people ; and aforetime i be as a tabret .
mine eye also be dim by reason of sorrow , and all my member be as a shadow .
upright man shall be astony at this , and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite .
the righteous also shall hold on he way , and he that have clean hand shall be stronger and stronger .
but as for you all , do ye return , and come now : for i can not find one wise man among you .
my day be past , my purpose be break off , even the thought of my heart .
they change the night into day : the light be short because of darkness .
if i wait , the grave be mine house : i have make my bed in the darkness .
i have say to corruption , thou art my father : to the worm , thou art my mother , and my sister .
and where be now my hope ? as for my hope , who shall see it ?
they shall go down to the bar of the pit , when we rest together be in the dust .
then answer bildad the shuhite , and say ,
how long will it be ere ye make a end of word ? mark , and afterwards we will speak .
wherefore be we count as beast , and repute vile in you sight ?
he teareth himself in he anger : shall the earth be forsake for thee ? and shall the rock be remove out of he place ?
yea , the light of the wicked shall be put out , and the spark of he fire shall not shine .
the light shall be dark in he tabernacle , and he candle shall be put out with he .
the step of he strength shall be straiten , and he own counsel shall cast he down .
for he be cast into a net by he own foot , and he walketh upon a snare .
the gin shall take he by the heel , and the robber shall prevail against he .
the snare be lay for he in the ground , and a trap for he in the way .
terror shall make he afraid on every side , and shall drive he to he foot .
he strength shall be hungerbitten , and destruction shall be ready at he side .
it shall devour the strength of he skin : even the firstborn of death shall devour he strength .
he confidence shall be root out of he tabernacle , and it shall bring he to the king of terror .
it shall dwell in he tabernacle , because it be none of he : brimstone shall be scatter upon he habitation .
he root shall be dry up beneath , and above shall he branch be cut off .
he remembrance shall perish from the earth , and he shall have no name in the street .
he shall be drive from light into darkness , and chase out of the world .
he shall neither have son nor nephew among he people , nor any remain in he dwelling .
they that come after he shall be astony at he day , as they that go before be affright .
surely such be the dwelling of the wicked , and this be the place of he that knoweth not god .
then job answer and say ,
how long will ye vex my soul , and break i in piece with word ?
these ten time have ye reproach i : ye be not ashamed that ye make yourselve strange to i .
and be it indeed that i have err , mine error remaineth with myself .
if indeed ye will magnify yourselve against i , and plead against i my reproach :
know now that god have overthrow i , and have compass i with he net .
behold , i cry out of wrong , but i be not hear : i cry aloud , but there be no judgment .
he have fence up my way that i can not pass , and he have set darkness in my path .
he have strip i of my glory , and take the crown from my head .
he have destroy i on every side , and i be go : and mine hope have he remove like a tree .
he have also kindle he wrath against i , and he counteth i unto he as one of he enemy .
he troops come together , and raise up they way against i , and encamp round about my tabernacle .
he have put my brethren far from i , and mine acquaintance be verily estrange from i .
my kinsfolk have fail , and my familiar friend have forget i .
they that dwell in mine house , and my maid , count i for a stranger : i be a alien in they sight .
i call my servant , and he give i no answer ; i intreat he with my mouth .
my breath be strange to my wife , though i intreat for the child 's sake of mine own body .
yea , young child despise i ; i arise , and they speak against i .
all my inward friend abhor i : and they whom i love be turn against i .
my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh , and i be escape with the skin of my tooth .
have pity upon i , have pity upon i , o ye my friend ; for the hand of god have touch i .
why do ye persecute i as god , and be not satisfy with my flesh ?
oh that my word be now write ! oh that they be print in a book !
that they be grave with a iron pen and lead in the rock for ever !
for i know that my redeemer liveth , and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth :
and though after my skin worm destroy this body , yet in my flesh shall i see god :
whom i shall see for myself , and mine eye shall behold , and not another ; though my rein be consume within i .
but ye should say , why persecute we he , see the root of the matter be find in i ?
be ye afraid of the sword : for wrath bringeth the punishment of the sword , that ye may know there be a judgment .
then answer zophar the naamathite , and say ,
therefore do my thought cause i to answer , and for this i make haste .
i have hear the check of my reproach , and the spirit of my understanding causeth i to answer .
knowest thou not this of old , since man be place upon earth ,
that the triumphing of the wicked be short , and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment ?
though he excellency mount up to the heaven , and he head reach unto the cloud ;
yet he shall perish for ever like he own dung : they which have see he shall say , where be he ?
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be find : yea , he shall be chase away as a vision of the night .
the eye also which see he shall see he no more ; neither shall he place any more behold he .
he child shall seek to please the poor , and he hand shall restore they goods .
he bone be full of the sin of he youth , which shall lie down with he in the dust .
though wickedness be sweet in he mouth , though he hide it under he tongue ;
though he spare it , and forsake it not ; but keep it still within he mouth :
yet he meat in he bowels be turn , it be the gall of asp within he .
he have swallow down riches , and he shall vomit they up again : god shall cast they out of he belly .
he shall suck the poison of asp : the viper 's tongue shall slay he .
he shall not see the river , the flood , the brook of honey and butter .
that which he labour for shall he restore , and shall not swallow it down : accord to he substance shall the restitution be , and he shall not rejoice therein .
because he have oppressed and have forsake the poor ; because he have violently take away a house which he build not ;
surely he shall not feel quietness in he belly , he shall not save of that which he desire .
there shall none of he meat be leave ; therefore shall no man look for he goods .
in the fulness of he sufficiency he shall be in strait : every hand of the wicked shall come upon he .
when he be about to fill he belly , god shall cast the fury of he wrath upon he , and shall rain it upon he while he be eat .
he shall flee from the iron weapon , and the bow of steel shall strike he through .
it be draw , and cometh out of the body ; yea , the glitter sword cometh out of he gall : terror be upon he .
all darkness shall be hide in he secret place : a fire not blow shall consume he ; it shall go ill with he that be leave in he tabernacle .
the heaven shall reveal he iniquity ; and the earth shall rise up against he .
the increase of he house shall depart , and he goods shall flow away in the day of he wrath .
this be the portion of a wicked man from god , and the heritage appoint unto he by god .
but job answer and say ,
hear diligently my speech , and let this be you consolation .
suffer i that i may speak ; and after that i have speak , mock on .
as for i , be my complaint to man ? and if it be so , why should not my spirit be trouble ?
mark i , and be astonish , and lay you hand upon you mouth .
even when i remember i be afraid , and tremble taketh hold on my flesh .
wherefore do the wicked live , become old , yea , be mighty in power ?
they seed be establish in they sight with they , and they offspring before they eye .
they house be safe from fear , neither be the rod of god upon they .
they bull gendereth , and faileth not ; they cow calveth , and casteth not she calf .
they send forth they little one like a flock , and they child dance .
they take the timbrel and harp , and rejoice at the sound of the organ .
they spend they day in wealth , and in a moment go down to the grave .
therefore they say unto god , depart from we ; for we desire not the knowledge of thy way .
what be the almighty , that we should serve he ? and what profit should we have , if we pray unto he ?
lo , they good be not in they hand : the counsel of the wicked be far from i .
how oft be the candle of the wicked put out ! and how oft cometh they destruction upon they !
god distributeth sorrow in he anger .
they be as stubble before the wind , and as chaff that the storm carrieth away .
god layeth up he iniquity for he child : he rewardeth he , and he shall know it .
he eye shall see he destruction , and he shall drink of the wrath of the almighty .
for what pleasure have he in he house after he , when the number of he month be cut off in the midst ?
shall any teach god knowledge ? see he judgeth those that be high .
one dieth in he full strength , be wholly at ease and quiet .
he breast be full of milk , and he bone be moisten with marrow .
and another dieth in the bitterness of he soul , and never eateth with pleasure .
they shall lie down alike in the dust , and the worm shall cover they .
behold , i know you thought , and the device which ye wrongfully imagine against i .
for ye say , where be the house of the prince ? and where be the dwelling place of the wicked ?
have ye not ask they that go by the way ? and do ye not know they token ,
that the wicked be reserve to the day of destruction ? they shall be bring forth to the day of wrath .
who shall declare he way to he face ? and who shall repay he what he have do ?
yet shall he be bring to the grave , and shall remain in the tomb .
the clod of the valley shall be sweet unto he , and every man shall draw after he , as there be innumerable before he .
how then comfort ye i in vain , see in you answer there remaineth falsehood ?
then eliphaz the temanite answer and say ,
can a man be profitable unto god , as he that be wise may be profitable unto himself ?
be it any pleasure to the almighty , that thou art righteous ? or be it gain to he , that thou makest thy way perfect ?
will he reprove thee for fear of thee ? will he enter with thee into judgment ?
be not thy wickedness great ? and thine iniquity infinite ?
for thou hast take a pledge from thy brother for nought , and strip the naked of they clothing .
thou hast not give water to the weary to drink , and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry .
but as for the mighty man , he have the earth ; and the honourable man dwell in it .
thou hast send widow away empty , and the arm of the fatherless have be break .
therefore snare be round about thee , and sudden fear troubleth thee ;
or darkness , that thou canst not see ; and abundance of water cover thee .
be not god in the height of heaven ? and behold the height of the star , how high they be !
and thou sayest , how doth god know ? can he judge through the dark cloud ?
thick cloud be a cover to he , that he seeth not ; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven .
hast thou mark the old way which wicked man have trodden ?
which be cut down out of time , whose foundation be overfly with a flood :
which say unto god , depart from we : and what can the almighty do for they ?
yet he fill they house with good thing : but the counsel of the wicked be far from i .
the righteous see it , and be glad : and the innocent laugh they to scorn .
whereas we substance be not cut down , but the remnant of they the fire consumeth .
acquaint now thyself with he , and be at peace : thereby good shall come unto thee .
receive , i pray thee , the law from he mouth , and lay up he word in thine heart .
if thou return to the almighty , thou shalt be build up , thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacle .
then shalt thou lay up gold as dust , and the gold of ophir as the stone of the brook .
yea , the almighty shall be thy defence , and thou shalt have plenty of silver .
for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty , and shalt lift up thy face unto god .
thou shalt make thy prayer unto he , and he shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy vow .
thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be establish unto thee : and the light shall shine upon thy way .
when man be cast down , then thou shalt say , there be lift up ; and he shall save the humble person .
he shall deliver the island of the innocent : and it be deliver by the pureness of thine hand .
then job answer and say ,
even to day be my complaint bitter : my stroke be heavier than my groaning .
oh that i know where i might find he ! that i might come even to he seat !
i would order my cause before he , and fill my mouth with argument .
i would know the word which he would answer i , and understand what he would say unto i .
will he plead against i with he great power ?
no ; but he would put strength in i .
there the righteous might dispute with he ; so should i be deliver for ever from my judge .
behold , i go forward , but he be not there ; and backward , but i can not perceive he :
on the left hand , where he doth work , but i can not behold he : he hideth himself on the right hand , that i can not see he :
but he knoweth the way that i take : when he have try i , i shall come forth as gold .
my foot have hold he step , he way have i keep , and not decline .
neither have i go back from the commandment of he lip ; i have esteem the word of he mouth more than my necessary food .
but he be in one mind , and who can turn he ? and what he soul desireth , even that he doeth .
for he performeth the thing that be appoint for i : and many such thing be with he .
therefore be i trouble at he presence : when i consider , i be afraid of he .
for god maketh my heart soft , and the almighty troubleth i :
because i be not cut off before the darkness , neither have he cover the darkness from my face .
why , see time be not hide from the almighty , do they that know he not see he day ?
some remove the landmark ; they violently take away flock , and feed thereof .
they drive away the ass of the fatherless , they take the widow 's ox for a pledge .
they turn the needy out of the way : the poor of the earth hide themselves together .
behold , as wild ass in the desert , go they forth to they work ; rise betime for a prey : the wilderness yieldeth food for they and for they child .
they reap every one he corn in the field : and they gather the vintage of the wicked .
they cause the naked to lodge without clothing , that they have no cover in the cold .
they be wet with the shower of the mountain , and embrace the rock for want of a shelter .
they pluck the fatherless from the breast , and take a pledge of the poor .
they cause he to go naked without clothing , and they take away the sheaf from the hungry ;
which make oil within they wall , and tread they winepress , and suffer thirst .
man groan from out of the city , and the soul of the wounded crieth out : yet god layeth not folly to they .
they be of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the way thereof , nor abide in the path thereof .
the murderer rise with the light killeth the poor and needy , and in the night be as a thief .
the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight , say , no eye shall see i : and disguiseth he face .
in the dark they dig through house , which they have mark for themselves in the daytime : they know not the light .
for the morning be to they even as the shadow of death : if one know they , they be in the terror of the shadow of death .
he be swift as the water ; they portion be curse in the earth : he beholdeth not the way of the vineyard .
drought and heat consume the snow water : so doth the grave those which have sin .
the womb shall forget he ; the worm shall feed sweetly on he ; he shall be no more remembered ; and wickedness shall be break as a tree .
he evil entreateth the barren that beareth not : and doeth not good to the widow .
he draweth also the mighty with he power : he riseth up , and no man be sure of life .
though it be give he to be in safety , whereon he resteth ; yet he eye be upon they way .
they be exalt for a little while , but be go and bring low ; they be take out of the way as all other , and cut off as the top of the ear of corn .
and if it be not so now , who will make i a liar , and make my speech nothing worth ?
then answer bildad the shuhite , and say ,
dominion and fear be with he , he maketh peace in he high place .
be there any number of he army ? and upon whom doth not he light arise ?
how then can man be justify with god ? or how can he be clean that be bear of a woman ?
behold even to the moon , and it shineth not ; yea , the star be not pure in he sight .
how much less man , that be a worm ? and the son of man , which be a worm ?
but job answer and say ,
how hast thou help he that be without power ? how savest thou the arm that have no strength ?
how hast thou counsel he that have no wisdom ? and how hast thou plentifully declare the thing as it be ?
to whom hast thou utter word ? and whose spirit come from thee ?
dead thing be form from under the water , and the inhabitant thereof .
hell be naked before he , and destruction have no cover .
he stretcheth out the north over the empty place , and hangeth the earth upon nothing .
he bindeth up the water in he thick cloud ; and the cloud be not rent under they .
he holdeth back the face of he throne , and spreadeth he cloud upon it .
he have compass the water with bound , until the day and night come to a end .
the pillar of heaven tremble and be astonish at he reproof .
he divideth the sea with he power , and by he understanding he smiteth through the proud .
by he spirit he have garnish the heaven ; he hand have form the crooked serpent .
lo , these be part of he way : but how little a portion be hear of he ? but the thunder of he power who can understand ?
moreover job continue he parable , and say ,
as god liveth , who have take away my judgment ; and the almighty , who have vex my soul ;
all the while my breath be in i , and the spirit of god be in my nostril ;
my lip shall not speak wickedness , nor my tongue utter deceit .
god forbid that i should justify you : till i die i will not remove mine integrity from i .
my righteousness i hold fast , and will not let it go : my heart shall not reproach i so long as i live .
let mine enemy be as the wicked , and he that riseth up against i as the unrighteous .
for what be the hope of the hypocrite , though he have gain , when god taketh away he soul ?
will god hear he cry when trouble cometh upon he ?
will he delight himself in the almighty ? will he always call upon god ?
i will teach you by the hand of god : that which be with the almighty will i not conceal .
behold , all ye yourselve have see it ; why then be ye thus altogether vain ?
this be the portion of a wicked man with god , and the heritage of oppressor , which they shall receive of the almighty .
if he child be multiply , it be for the sword : and he offspring shall not be satisfy with bread .
those that remain of he shall be bury in death : and he widow shall not weep .
though he heap up silver as the dust , and prepare raiment as the clay ;
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver .
he buildeth he house as a moth , and as a booth that the keeper maketh .
the rich man shall lie down , but he shall not be gather : he openeth he eye , and he be not .
terror take hold on he as water , a tempest stealeth he away in the night .
the east wind carrieth he away , and he departeth : and as a storm hurleth he out of he place .
for god shall cast upon he , and not spare : he would fain flee out of he hand .
man shall clap they hand at he , and shall hiss he out of he place .
surely there be a vein for the silver , and a place for gold where they fine it .
iron be take out of the earth , and brass be melt out of the stone .
he setteth a end to darkness , and searcheth out all perfection : the stone of darkness , and the shadow of death .
the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant ; even the water forget of the foot : they be dry up , they be go away from man .
as for the earth , out of it cometh bread : and under it be turn up as it be fire .
the stone of it be the place of sapphire : and it have dust of gold .
there be a path which no fowl knoweth , and which the vulture 's eye have not see :
the lion 's whelp have not trodden it , nor the fierce lion pass by it .
he putteth forth he hand upon the rock ; he overturneth the mountain by the root .
he cutteth out river among the rock ; and he eye seeth every precious thing .
he bindeth the flood from overflow ; and the thing that be hide bringeth he forth to light .
but where shall wisdom be find ? and where be the place of understand ?
man knoweth not the price thereof ; neither be it find in the land of the living .
the depth saith , it be not in i : and the sea saith , it be not with i .
it can not be get for gold , neither shall silver be weigh for the price thereof .
it can not be value with the gold of ophir , with the precious onyx , or the sapphire .
the gold and the crystal can not equal it : and the exchange of it shall not be for jewel of fine gold .
no mention shall be make of coral , or of pearl : for the price of wisdom be above ruby .
the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it , neither shall it be value with pure gold .
whence then cometh wisdom ? and where be the place of understand ?
see it be hide from the eye of all living , and keep close from the fowl of the air .
destruction and death say , we have hear the fame thereof with we ear .
god understandeth the way thereof , and he knoweth the place thereof .
for he looketh to the end of the earth , and seeth under the whole heaven ;
to make the weight for the wind ; and he weigheth the water by measure .
when he make a decree for the rain , and a way for the lightning of the thunder :
then do he see it , and declare it ; he prepare it , yea , and search it out .
and unto man he say , behold , the fear of the lord , that be wisdom ; and to depart from evil be understand .
moreover job continue he parable , and say ,
oh that i be as in month past , as in the day when god preserve i ;
when he candle shine upon my head , and when by he light i walk through darkness ;
as i be in the day of my youth , when the secret of god be upon my tabernacle ;
when the almighty be yet with i , when my child be about i ;
when i wash my step with butter , and the rock pour i out river of oil ;
when i go out to the gate through the city , when i prepare my seat in the street !
the young man see i , and hide themselves : and the aged arise , and stand up .
the prince refrain talk , and lay they hand on they mouth .
the noble hold they peace , and they tongue cleave to the roof of they mouth .
when the ear hear i , then it bless i ; and when the eye see i , it give witness to i :
because i deliver the poor that cry , and the fatherless , and he that have none to help he .
the blessing of he that be ready to perish come upon i : and i cause the widow 's heart to sing for joy .
i put on righteousness , and it clothe i : my judgment be as a robe and a diadem .
i be eye to the blind , and foot be i to the lame .
i be a father to the poor : and the cause which i know not i search out .
and i brake the jaw of the wicked , and pluck the spoil out of he tooth .
then i say , i shall die in my nest , and i shall multiply my day as the sand .
my root be spread out by the water , and the dew lay all night upon my branch .
my glory be fresh in i , and my bow be renew in my hand .
unto i man give ear , and wait , and keep silence at my counsel .
after my word they speak not again ; and my speech drop upon they .
and they wait for i as for the rain ; and they open they mouth wide as for the latter rain .
if i laugh on they , they believe it not ; and the light of my countenance they cast not down .
i choose out they way , and sit chief , and dwelt as a king in the army , as one that comforteth the mourner .
but now they that be younger than i have i in derision , whose father i would have disdain to have set with the dog of my flock .
yea , whereto might the strength of they hand profit i , in whom old age be perish ?
for want and famine they be solitary ; flee into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste .
who cut up mallow by the bush , and juniper root for they meat .
they be drive forth from among man , ( they cry after they as after a thief ; )
to dwell in the cliff of the valley , in cave of the earth , and in the rock .
among the bush they bray ; under the nettle they be gather together .
they be child of fool , yea , child of base man : they be viler than the earth .
and now be i they song , yea , i be they byword .
they abhor i , they flee far from i , and spare not to spit in my face .
because he have loose my cord , and afflict i , they have also let loose the bridle before i .
upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my foot , and they raise up against i the way of they destruction .
they mar my path , they set forward my calamity , they have no helper .
they come upon i as a wide breaking in of water : in the desolation they roll themselves upon i .
terror be turn upon i : they pursue my soul as the wind : and my welfare passeth away as a cloud .
and now my soul be pour out upon i ; the day of affliction have take hold upon i .
my bone be pierce in i in the night season : and my sinew take no rest .
by the great force of my disease be my garment change : it bindeth i about as the collar of my coat .
he have cast i into the mire , and i be become like dust and ash .
i cry unto thee , and thou dost not hear i : i stand up , and thou regardest i not .
thou art become cruel to i : with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against i .
thou liftest i up to the wind ; thou causest i to ride upon it , and dissolvest my substance .
for i know that thou wilt bring i to death , and to the house appoint for all living .
howbeit he will not stretch out he hand to the grave , though they cry in he destruction .
do not i weep for he that be in trouble ? be not my soul grieve for the poor ?
when i look for good , then evil come unto i : and when i wait for light , there come darkness .
my bowels boil , and rest not : the day of affliction prevent i .
i go mourning without the sun : i stand up , and i cry in the congregation .
i be a brother to dragon , and a companion to owl .
my skin be black upon i , and my bone be burn with heat .
my harp also be turn to mourning , and my organ into the voice of they that weep .
i make a covenant with mine eye ; why then should i think upon a maid ?
for what portion of god be there from above ? and what inheritance of the almighty from on high ?
be not destruction to the wicked ? and a strange punishment to the worker of iniquity ?
doth not he see my way , and count all my step ?
if i have walk with vanity , or if my foot have hast to deceit ;
let i be weigh in a even balance that god may know mine integrity .
if my step have turn out of the way , and mine heart walk after mine eye , and if any blot have cleave to mine hand ;
then let i sow , and let another eat ; yea , let my offspring be root out .
if mine heart have be deceive by a woman , or if i have lay wait at my neighbour 's door ;
then let my wife grind unto another , and let other bow down upon she .
for this be a heinous crime ; yea , it be a iniquity to be punish by the judge .
for it be a fire that consumeth to destruction , and would root out all mine increase .
if i do despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant , when they contend with i ;
what then shall i do when god riseth up ? and when he visiteth , what shall i answer he ?
do not he that make i in the womb make he ? and do not one fashion we in the womb ?
if i have withhold the poor from they desire , or have cause the eye of the widow to fail ;
or have eat my morsel myself alone , and the fatherless have not eat thereof ;
( for from my youth he be bring up with i , as with a father , and i have guide she from my mother 's womb ; )
if i have see any perish for want of clothing , or any poor without cover ;
if he loin have not bless i , and if he be not warm with the fleece of my sheep ;
if i have lift up my hand against the fatherless , when i see my help in the gate :
then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade , and mine arm be break from the bone .
for destruction from god be a terror to i , and by reason of he highness i could not endure .
if i have make gold my hope , or have say to the fine gold , thou art my confidence ;
if i rejoice because my wealth be great , and because mine hand have get much ;
if i behold the sun when it shine , or the moon walk in brightness ;
and my heart have be secretly entice , or my mouth have kiss my hand :
this also be a iniquity to be punish by the judge : for i should have deny the god that be above .
if i rejoice at the destruction of he that hate i , or lift up myself when evil find he :
neither have i suffer my mouth to sin by wish a curse to he soul .
if the man of my tabernacle say not , oh that we have of he flesh ! we can not be satisfy .
the stranger do not lodge in the street : but i open my door to the traveller .
if i cover my transgression as adam , by hide mine iniquity in my bosom :
do i fear a great multitude , or do the contempt of family terrify i , that i keep silence , and go not out of the door ?
oh that one would hear i ! behold , my desire be , that the almighty would answer i , and that mine adversary have write a book .
surely i would take it upon my shoulder , and bind it as a crown to i .
i would declare unto he the number of my step ; as a prince would i go near unto he .
if my land cry against i , or that the furrow likewise thereof complain ;
if i have eat the fruit thereof without money , or have cause the owner thereof to lose they life :
let thistle grow instead of wheat , and cockle instead of barley .
the word of job be end .
so these three man cease to answer job , because he be righteous in he own eye .
then be kindle the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the buzite , of the kindred of ram : against job be he wrath kindle , because he justify himself rather than god .
also against he three friend be he wrath kindle , because they have find no answer , and yet have condemn job .
now elihu have wait till job have speak , because they be elder than he .
when elihu see that there be no answer in the mouth of these three man , then he wrath be kindle .
and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answer and say , i be young , and ye be very old ; wherefore i be afraid , and durst not shew you mine opinion .
i say , day should speak , and multitude of year should teach wisdom .
but there be a spirit in man : and the inspiration of the almighty giveth they understanding .
great man be not always wise : neither do the aged understand judgment .
therefore i say , hearken to i ; i also will shew mine opinion .
behold , i wait for you word ; i give ear to you reason , whilst ye search out what to say .
yea , i attend unto you , and , behold , there be none of you that convinced job , or that answer he word :
lest ye should say , we have find out wisdom : god thrusteth he down , not man .
now he have not direct he word against i : neither will i answer he with you speech .
they be amaze , they answer no more : they leave off speaking .
when i have wait , ( for they speak not , but stand still , and answer no more ; )
i say , i will answer also my part , i also will shew mine opinion .
for i be full of matter , the spirit within i constraineth i .
behold , my belly be as wine which have no vent ; it be ready to burst like new bottle .
i will speak , that i may be refresh : i will open my lip and answer .
let i not , i pray you , accept any man 's person , neither let i give flattering title unto man .
for i know not to give flattering title ; in so do my maker would soon take i away .
wherefore , job , i pray thee , hear my speech , and hearken to all my word .
behold , now i have open my mouth , my tongue have speak in my mouth .
my word shall be of the uprightness of my heart : and my lip shall utter knowledge clearly .
the spirit of god have make i , and the breath of the almighty have give i life .
if thou canst answer i , set thy word in order before i , stand up .
behold , i be accord to thy wish in god 's stead : i also be form out of the clay .
behold , my terror shall not make thee afraid , neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee .
surely thou hast speak in mine hearing , and i have hear the voice of thy word , say ,
i be clean without transgression , i be innocent ; neither be there iniquity in i .
behold , he findeth occasion against i , he counteth i for he enemy ,
he putteth my foot in the stock , he marketh all my path .
behold , in this thou art not just : i will answer thee , that god be greater than man .
why dost thou strive against he ? for he giveth not account of any of he matter .
for god speaketh once , yea twice , yet man perceiveth it not .
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth upon man , in slumbering upon the bed ;
then he openeth the ear of man , and sealeth they instruction ,
that he may withdraw man from he purpose , and hide pride from man .
he keepeth back he soul from the pit , and he life from perish by the sword .
he be chasten also with pain upon he bed , and the multitude of he bone with strong pain :
so that he life abhorreth bread , and he soul dainty meat .
he flesh be consume away , that it can not be see ; and he bone that be not see stick out .
yea , he soul draweth near unto the grave , and he life to the destroyer .
if there be a messenger with he , a interpreter , one among a thousand , to shew unto man he uprightness :
then he be gracious unto he , and saith , deliver he from go down to the pit : i have find a ransom .
he flesh shall be fresher than a child 's : he shall return to the day of he youth :
he shall pray unto god , and he will be favourable unto he : and he shall see he face with joy : for he will render unto man he righteousness .
he looketh upon man , and if any say , i have sin , and pervert that which be right , and it profit i not ;
he will deliver he soul from go into the pit , and he life shall see the light .
lo , all these thing worketh god oftentimes with man ,
to bring back he soul from the pit , to be enlighten with the light of the living .
mark well , o job , hearken unto i : hold thy peace , and i will speak .
if thou hast anything to say , answer i : speak , for i desire to justify thee .
if not , hearken unto i : hold thy peace , and i shall teach thee wisdom .
furthermore elihu answer and say ,
hear my word , o ye wise man ; and give ear unto i , ye that have knowledge .
for the ear trieth word , as the mouth tasteth meat .
let we choose to we judgment : let we know among ourselves what be good .
for job have say , i be righteous : and god have take away my judgment .
should i lie against my right ? my wound be incurable without transgression .
what man be like job , who drinketh up scorn like water ?
which goeth in company with the worker of iniquity , and walketh with wicked man .
for he have say , it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with god .
therefore hearken unto i ye man of understanding : far be it from god , that he should do wickedness ; and from the almighty , that he should commit iniquity .
for the work of a man shall he render unto he , and cause every man to find accord to he way .
yea , surely god will not do wickedly , neither will the almighty pervert judgment .
who have give he a charge over the earth ? or who have dispose the whole world ?
if he set he heart upon man , if he gather unto himself he spirit and he breath ;
all flesh shall perish together , and man shall turn again unto dust .
if now thou hast understanding , hear this : hearken to the voice of my word .
shall even he that hateth right govern ? and wilt thou condemn he that be most just ?
be it fit to say to a king , thou art wicked ? and to prince , ye be ungodly ?
how much less to he that accepteth not the person of prince , nor regardeth the rich more than the poor ? for they all be the work of he hand .
in a moment shall they die , and the people shall be trouble at midnight , and pass away : and the mighty shall be take away without hand .
for he eye be upon the way of man , and he seeth all he going .
there be no darkness , nor shadow of death , where the worker of iniquity may hide themselves .
for he will not lay upon man more than right ; that he should enter into judgment with god .
he shall break in piece mighty man without number , and set other in they stead .
therefore he knoweth they work , and he overturneth they in the night , so that they be destroy .
he striketh they as wicked man in the open sight of other ;
because they turn back from he , and would not consider any of he way :
so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto he , and he heareth the cry of the afflict .
when he giveth quietness , who then can make trouble ? and when he hideth he face , who then can behold he ? whether it be do against a nation , or against a man only :
that the hypocrite reign not , lest the people be ensnare .
surely it be meet to be say unto god , i have bear chastisement , i will not offend any more :
that which i see not teach thou i : if i have do iniquity , i will do no more .
should it be accord to thy mind ? he will recompense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not i : therefore speak what thou knowest .
let man of understand tell i , and let a wise man hearken unto i .
job have speak without knowledge , and he word be without wisdom .
my desire be that job may be try unto the end because of he answer for wicked man .
for he addeth rebellion unto he sin , he clappeth he hand among we , and multiplieth he word against god .
elihu spake moreover , and say ,
thinkest thou this to be right , that thou saidst , my righteousness be more than god 's ?
for thou saidst , what advantage will it be unto thee ? and , what profit shall i have , if i be cleanse from my sin ?
i will answer thee , and thy companion with thee .
look unto the heaven , and see ; and behold the cloud which be higher than thou .
if thou sinnest , what doest thou against he ? or if thy transgression be multiply , what doest thou unto he ?
if thou be righteous , what givest thou he ? or what receiveth he of thine hand ?
thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art ; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man .
by reason of the multitude of oppression they make the oppress to cry : they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty .
but none saith , where be god my maker , who giveth song in the night ;
who teacheth we more than the beast of the earth , and maketh we wiser than the fowl of heaven ?
there they cry , but none giveth answer , because of the pride of evil man .
surely god will not hear vanity , neither will the almighty regard it .
although thou sayest thou shalt not see he , yet judgment be before he ; therefore trust thou in he .
but now , because it be not so , he have visit in he anger ; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity :
therefore doth job open he mouth in vain ; he multiplieth word without knowledge .
elihu also proceed , and say ,
suffer i a little , and i will shew thee that i have yet to speak on god 's behalf .
i will fetch my knowledge from afar , and will ascribe righteousness to my maker .
for truly my word shall not be false : he that be perfect in knowledge be with thee .
behold , god be mighty , and despiseth not any : he be mighty in strength and wisdom .
he preserveth not the life of the wicked : but giveth right to the poor .
he withdraweth not he eye from the righteous : but with king be they on the throne ; yea , he doth establish they for ever , and they be exalt .
and if they be bind in fetter , and be holden in cord of affliction ;
then he sheweth they they work , and they transgression that they have exceed .
he openeth also they ear to discipline , and commandeth that they return from iniquity .
if they obey and serve he , they shall spend they day in prosperity , and they year in pleasure .
but if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge .
but the hypocrite in heart heap up wrath : they cry not when he bindeth they .
they die in youth , and they life be among the unclean .
he delivereth the poor in he affliction , and openeth they ear in oppression .
even so would he have remove thee out of the strait into a broad place , where there be no straitness ; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness .
but thou hast fulfil the judgment of the wicked : judgment and justice take hold on thee .
because there be wrath , beware lest he take thee away with he stroke : then a great ransom can not deliver thee .
will he esteem thy riches ? no , not gold , nor all the force of strength .
desire not the night , when people be cut off in they place .
take heed , regard not iniquity : for this hast thou choose rather than affliction .
behold , god exalteth by he power : who teacheth like he ?
who have enjoin he he way ? or who can say , thou hast work iniquity ?
remember that thou magnify he work , which man behold .
every man may see it ; man may behold it afar off .
behold , god be great , and we know he not , neither can the number of he year be search out .
for he maketh small the drop of water : they pour down rain accord to the vapour thereof :
which the cloud do drop and distil upon man abundantly .
also can any understand the spreading of the cloud , or the noise of he tabernacle ?
behold , he spreadeth he light upon it , and covereth the bottom of the sea .
for by they judgeth he the people ; he giveth meat in abundance .
with cloud he covereth the light ; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt .
the noise thereof sheweth concern it , the cattle also concern the vapour .
at this also my heart trembleth , and be move out of he place .
hear attentively the noise of he voice , and the sound that goeth out of he mouth .
he directeth it under the whole heaven , and he lightning unto the end of the earth .
after it a voice roareth : he thundereth with the voice of he excellency ; and he will not stay they when he voice be hear .
god thundereth marvellously with he voice ; great thing doeth he , which we can not comprehend .
for he saith to the snow , be thou on the earth ; likewise to the small rain , and to the great rain of he strength .
he sealeth up the hand of every man ; that all man may know he work .
then the beast go into den , and remain in they place .
out of the south cometh the whirlwind : and cold out of the north .
by the breath of god frost be give : and the breadth of the water be straiten .
also by water he wearieth the thick cloud : he scattereth he bright cloud :
and it be turn round about by he counsel : that they may do whatsoever he commandeth they upon the face of the world in the earth .
he causeth it to come , whether for correction , or for he land , or for mercy .
hearken unto this , o job : stand still , and consider the wondrous work of god .
dost thou know when god dispose they , and cause the light of he cloud to shine ?
dost thou know the balancing of the cloud , the wondrous work of he which be perfect in knowledge ?
how thy garment be warm , when he quieteth the earth by the south wind ?
hast thou with he spread out the sky , which be strong , and as a molten look glass ?
teach we what we shall say unto he ; for we can not order we speech by reason of darkness .
shall it be tell he that i speak ? if a man speak , surely he shall be swallow up .
and now man see not the bright light which be in the cloud : but the wind passeth , and cleanseth they .
fair weather cometh out of the north : with god be terrible majesty .
touch the almighty , we can not find he out : he be excellent in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not afflict .
man do therefore fear he : he respecteth not any that be wise of heart .
then the lord answer job out of the whirlwind , and say ,
who be this that darkeneth counsel by word without knowledge ?
gird up now thy loin like a man ; for i will demand of thee , and answer thou i .
where wast thou when i lay the foundation of the earth ? declare , if thou hast understanding .
who have lay the measure thereof , if thou knowest ? or who have stretch the line upon it ?
whereupon be the foundation thereof fasten ? or who lay the corner stone thereof ;
when the morning star sing together , and all the son of god shout for joy ?
or who shut up the sea with door , when it brake forth , as if it have issue out of the womb ?
when i make the cloud the garment thereof , and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it ,
and brake up for it my decree place , and set bar and door ,
and say , hitherto shalt thou come , but no further : and here shall thy proud wave be stay ?
hast thou command the morning since thy day ; and cause the dayspring to know he place ;
that it might take hold of the end of the earth , that the wicked might be shake out of it ?
it be turn as clay to the seal ; and they stand as a garment .
and from the wicked they light be withholden , and the high arm shall be break .
hast thou enter into the spring of the sea ? or hast thou walk in the search of the depth ?
have the gate of death be open unto thee ? or hast thou see the door of the shadow of death ?
hast thou perceive the breadth of the earth ? declare if thou knowest it all .
where be the way where light dwelleth ? and as for darkness , where be the place thereof ,
that thou shouldest take it to the bind thereof , and that thou shouldest know the path to the house thereof ?
knowest thou it , because thou wast then bear ? or because the number of thy day be great ?
hast thou enter into the treasure of the snow ? or hast thou see the treasure of the hail ,
which i have reserve against the time of trouble , against the day of battle and war ?
by what way be the light parted , which scattereth the east wind upon the earth ?
who have divide a watercourse for the overflow of water , or a way for the lightning of thunder ;
to cause it to rain on the earth , where no man be ; on the wilderness , wherein there be no man ;
to satisfy the desolate and waste ground ; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth ?
hath the rain a father ? or who have beget the drop of dew ?
out of whose womb come the ice ? and the hoary frost of heaven , who have gendered it ?
the water be hide as with a stone , and the face of the deep be freeze .
canst thou bind the sweet influence of pleiades , or loose the band of orion ?
canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in he season ? or canst thou guide arcturus with he son ?
knowest thou the ordinance of heaven ? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth ?
canst thou lift up thy voice to the cloud , that abundance of water may cover thee ?
canst thou send lightning , that they may go , and say unto thee , here we be ?
who have put wisdom in the inward part ? or who have give understand to the heart ?
who can number the cloud in wisdom ? or who can stay the bottle of heaven ,
when the dust groweth into hardness , and the clod cleave fast together ?
wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion ? or fill the appetite of the young lion ,
when they couch in they den , and abide in the covert to lie in wait ?
who provideth for the raven he food ? when he young one cry unto god , they wander for lack of meat .
knowest thou the time when the wild goat of the rock bring forth ? or canst thou mark when the hind do calve ?
canst thou number the month that they fulfil ? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth ?
they bow themselves , they bring forth they young one , they cast out they sorrow .
they young one be in good liking , they grow up with corn ; they go forth , and return not unto they .
who have send out the wild ass free ? or who have loose the band of the wild ass ?
whose house i have make the wilderness , and the barren land he dwelling .
he scorneth the multitude of the city , neither regardeth he the cry of the driver .
the range of the mountain be he pasture , and he searcheth after every green thing .
will the unicorn be willing to serve thee , or abide by thy crib ?
canst thou bind the unicorn with he band in the furrow ? or will he harrow the valley after thee ?
wilt thou trust he , because he strength be great ? or wilt thou leave thy labour to he ?
wilt thou believe he , that he will bring home thy seed , and gather it into thy barn ?
gavest thou the goodly wing unto the peacock ? or wing and feather unto the ostrich ?
which leaveth she egg in the earth , and warmeth they in dust ,
and forgetteth that the foot may crush they , or that the wild beast may break they .
she be harden against she young one , as though they be not hers : she labour be in vain without fear ;
because god have deprive she of wisdom , neither have he impart to she understanding .
what time she lifteth up herself on high , she scorneth the horse and he rider .
hast thou give the horse strength ? hast thou clothe he neck with thunder ?
canst thou make he afraid as a grasshopper ? the glory of he nostril be terrible .
he paweth in the valley , and rejoiceth in he strength : he goeth on to meet the armed man .
he mocketh at fear , and be not affright ; neither turneth he back from the sword .
the quiver rattleth against he , the glittering spear and the shield .
he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage : neither believeth he that it be the sound of the trumpet .
he saith among the trumpet , ha , ha ; and he smelleth the battle afar off , the thunder of the captain , and the shouting .
doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom , and stretch she wing toward the south ?
doth the eagle mount up at thy command , and make she nest on high ?
she dwelleth and abideth on the rock , upon the crag of the rock , and the strong place .
from thence she seeketh the prey , and she eye behold afar off .
she young one also suck up blood : and where the slay be , there be she .
moreover the lord answer job , and say ,
shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct he ? he that reproveth god , let he answer it .
then job answer the lord , and say ,
behold , i be vile ; what shall i answer thee ?
i will lay mine hand upon my mouth .
once have i speak ; but i will not answer : yea , twice ; but i will proceed no further .
then answer the lord unto job out of the whirlwind , and say ,
gird up thy loin now like a man : i will demand of thee , and declare thou unto i .
wilt thou also disannul my judgment ? wilt thou condemn i , that thou mayest be righteous ?
hast thou a arm like god ? or canst thou thunder with a voice like he ?
deck thyself now with majesty and excellency ; and array thyself with glory and beauty .
cast abroad the rage of thy wrath : and behold every one that be proud , and abase he .
look on every one that be proud , and bring he low ; and tread down the wicked in they place .
hide they in the dust together ; and bind they face in secret .
then will i also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee .
behold now behemoth , which i make with thee ; he eateth grass as a ox .
lo now , he strength be in he loin , and he force be in the navel of he belly .
he moveth he tail like a cedar : the sinew of he stone be wrap together .
he bone be as strong piece of brass ; he bone be like bar of iron .
he be the chief of the way of god : he that make he can make he sword to approach unto he .
surely the mountain bring he forth food , where all the beast of the field play .
he lieth under the shady tree , in the covert of the reed , and fen .
the shady tree cover he with they shadow ; the willow of the brook compass he about .
behold , he drinketh up a river , and hasteth not : he trusteth that he can draw up jordan into he mouth .
he taketh it with he eye : he nose pierceth through snare .
canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook ? or he tongue with a cord which thou lettest down ?
canst thou put a hook into he nose ? or bear he jaw through with a thorn ?
will he make many supplication unto thee ? will he speak soft word unto thee ?
will he make a covenant with thee ? wilt thou take he for a servant for ever ?
wilt thou play with he as with a bird ? or wilt thou bind he for thy maiden ?
shall the companion make a banquet of he ? shall they part he among the merchant ?
canst thou fill he skin with barb iron ? or he head with fish spear ?
lay thine hand upon he , remember the battle , do no more .
behold , the hope of he be in vain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of he ?
none be so fierce that dare stir he up : who then be able to stand before i ?
who have prevent i , that i should repay he ? whatsoever be under the whole heaven be mine .
i will not conceal he part , nor he power , nor he comely proportion .
who can discover the face of he garment ? or who can come to he with he double bridle ?
who can open the door of he face ? he tooth be terrible round about .
he scale be he pride , shut up together as with a close seal .
one be so near to another , that no air can come between they .
they be join one to another , they stick together , that they can not be sunder .
by he neesing a light doth shine , and he eye be like the eyelid of the morning .
out of he mouth go burn lamp , and spark of fire leap out .
out of he nostril goeth smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron .
he breath kindleth coal , and a flame goeth out of he mouth .
in he neck remaineth strength , and sorrow be turn into joy before he .
the flake of he flesh be join together : they be firm in themselves ; they can not be move .
he heart be as firm as a stone ; yea , as hard as a piece of the nether millstone .
when he raiseth up himself , the mighty be afraid : by reason of breaking they purify themselves .
the sword of he that layeth at he can not hold : the spear , the dart , nor the habergeon .
he esteemeth iron as straw , and brass as rotten wood .
the arrow can not make he flee : slingstone be turn with he into stubble .
dart be count as stubble : he laugheth at the shake of a spear .
sharp stone be under he : he spreadeth sharp pointed thing upon the mire .
he maketh the deep to boil like a pot : he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment .
he maketh a path to shine after he ; one would think the deep to be hoary .
upon earth there be not he like , who be make without fear .
he beholdeth all high thing : he be a king over all the child of pride .
then job answer the lord , and say ,
i know that thou canst do every thing , and that no thought can be withholden from thee .
who be he that hideth counsel without knowledge ? therefore have i utter that i understand not ; thing too wonderful for i , which i know not .
hear , i beseech thee , and i will speak : i will demand of thee , and declare thou unto i .
i have hear of thee by the hearing of the ear : but now mine eye seeth thee .
wherefore i abhor myself , and repent in dust and ash .
and it be so , that after the lord have speak these word unto job , the lord say to eliphaz the temanite , my wrath be kindle against thee , and against thy two friend : for ye have not speak of i the thing that be right , as my servant job have .
therefore take unto you now seven bullock and seven ram , and go to my servant job , and offer up for yourselve a burnt offering ; and my servant job shall pray for you : for he will i accept : lest i deal with you after you folly , in that ye have not speak of i the thing which be right , like my servant job .
so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite go , and do accord as the lord command they : the lord also accept job .
and the lord turn the captivity of job , when he pray for he friend : also the lord give job twice as much as he have before .
then come there unto he all he brethren , and all he sister , and all they that have be of he acquaintance before , and do eat bread with he in he house : and they bemoan he , and comfort he over all the evil that the lord have bring upon he : every man also give he a piece of money , and every one a earring of gold .
so the lord bless the latter end of job more than he beginning : for he have fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand camel , and a thousand yoke of ox , and a thousand she ass .
he have also seven son and three daughter .
and he call the name of the first , jemima ; and the name of the second , kezia ; and the name of the third , kerenhappuch .
and in all the land be no woman find so fair as the daughter of job : and they father give they inheritance among they brethren .
after this live job a hundred and forty year , and see he son , and he son ' son , even four generation .
so job die , be old and full of day .
bless be the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly , nor standeth in the way of sinner , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful .
but he delight be in the law of the lord ; and in he law doth he meditate day and night .
and he shall be like a tree plant by the river of water , that bringeth forth he fruit in he season ; he leaf also shall not wither ; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper .
the ungodly be not so : but be like the chaff which the wind driveth away .
therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment , nor sinner in the congregation of the righteous .
for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous : but the way of the ungodly shall perish .
why do the heathen rage , and the people imagine a vain thing ?
the king of the earth set themselves , and the ruler take counsel together , against the lord , and against he anointed , say ,
let we break they band asunder , and cast away they cord from we .
he that sitteth in the heaven shall laugh : the lord shall have they in derision .
then shall he speak unto they in he wrath , and vex they in he sore displeasure .
yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion .
i will declare the decree : the lord have say unto i , thou art my son ; this day have i beget thee .
ask of i , and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost part of the earth for thy possession .
thou shalt break they with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash they in piece like a potter 's vessel .
be wise now therefore , o ye king : be instruct , ye judge of the earth .
serve the lord with fear , and rejoice with tremble .
kiss the son , lest he be angry , and ye perish from the way , when he wrath be kindle but a little .
bless be all they that put they trust in he .
lord , how be they increase that trouble i ! many be they that rise up against i .
many there be which say of my soul , there be no help for he in god .
selah .
but thou , o lord , art a shield for i ; my glory , and the lifter up of mine head .
i cry unto the lord with my voice , and he hear i out of he holy hill .
selah .
i lay i down and sleep ; i awake ; for the lord sustain i .
i will not be afraid of ten thousand of people , that have set themselves against i round about .
arise , o lord ; save i , o my god : for thou hast smite all mine enemy upon the cheek bone ; thou hast break the tooth of the ungodly .
salvation belongeth unto the lord : thy blessing be upon thy people .
selah .
hear i when i call , o god of my righteousness : thou hast enlarged i when i be in distress ; have mercy upon i , and hear my prayer .
o ye son of man , how long will ye turn my glory into shame ? how long will ye love vanity , and seek after lease ?
selah .
but know that the lord have set apart he that be godly for himself : the lord will hear when i call unto he .
stand in awe , and sin not : commune with you own heart upon you bed , and be still .
selah .
offer the sacrifice of righteousness , and put you trust in the lord .
there be many that say , who will shew we any good ?
lord , lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon we .
thou hast put gladness in my heart , more than in the time that they corn and they wine increase .
i will both lay i down in peace , and sleep : for thou , lord , only makest i dwell in safety .
give ear to my word , o lord , consider my meditation .
hearken unto the voice of my cry , my king , and my god : for unto thee will i pray .
my voice shalt thou hear in the morning , o lord ; in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee , and will look up .
for thou art not a god that have pleasure in wickedness : neither shall evil dwell with thee .
the foolish shall not stand in thy sight : thou hatest all worker of iniquity .
thou shalt destroy they that speak leasing : the lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man .
but as for i , i will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy : and in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple .
lead i , o lord , in thy righteousness because of mine enemy ; make thy way straight before my face .
for there be no faithfulness in they mouth ; they inward part be very wickedness ; they throat be a open sepulchre ; they flatter with they tongue .
destroy thou they , o god ; let they fall by they own counsel ; cast they out in the multitude of they transgression ; for they have rebel against thee .
but let all those that put they trust in thee rejoice : let they ever shout for joy , because thou defendest they : let they also that love thy name be joyful in thee .
for thou , lord , wilt bless the righteous ; with favour wilt thou compass he as with a shield .
o lord , rebuke i not in thine anger , neither chasten i in thy hot displeasure .
have mercy upon i , o lord ; for i be weak : o lord , heal i ; for my bone be vex .
my soul be also sore vex : but thou , o lord , how long ?
return , o lord , deliver my soul : oh save i for thy mercy ' sake .
for in death there be no remembrance of thee : in the grave who shall give thee thanks ?
i be weary with my groan ; all the night make i my bed to swim ; i water my couch with my tear .
mine eye be consume because of grief ; it waxeth old because of all mine enemy .
depart from i , all ye worker of iniquity ; for the lord have hear the voice of my weep .
the lord have hear my supplication ; the lord will receive my prayer .
let all mine enemy be ashamed and sore vex : let they return and be ashamed suddenly .
o lord my god , in thee do i put my trust : save i from all they that persecute i , and deliver i :
lest he tear my soul like a lion , rend it in piece , while there be none to deliver .
o lord my god , if i have do this ; if there be iniquity in my hand ;
if i have reward evil unto he that be at peace with i ; ( yea , i have deliver he that without cause be mine enemy : )
let the enemy persecute my soul , and take it ; yea , let he tread down my life upon the earth , and lay mine honour in the dust .
selah .
arise , o lord , in thine anger , lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemy : and awake for i to the judgment that thou hast command .
so shall the congregation of the people compass thee about : for they sake therefore return thou on high .
the lord shall judge the people : judge i , o lord , accord to my righteousness , and accord to mine integrity that be in i .
oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to a end ; but establish the just : for the righteous god trieth the heart and rein .
my defence be of god , which saveth the upright in heart .
god judgeth the righteous , and god be angry with the wicked every day .
if he turn not , he will whet he sword ; he have bent he bow , and make it ready .
he have also prepare for he the instrument of death ; he ordaineth he arrow against the persecutor .
behold , he travaileth with iniquity , and have conceive mischief , and bring forth falsehood .
he make a pit , and dig it , and be fall into the ditch which he make .
he mischief shall return upon he own head , and he violent dealing shall come down upon he own pate .
i will praise the lord accord to he righteousness : and will sing praise to the name of the lord most high .
o lord , we lord , how excellent be thy name in all the earth ! who hast set thy glory above the heaven .
out of the mouth of babe and suckling hast thou ordain strength because of thine enemy , that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger .
when i consider thy heaven , the work of thy finger , the moon and the star , which thou hast ordain ;
what be man , that thou art mindful of he ? and the son of man , that thou visitest he ?
for thou hast make he a little lower than the angel , and hast crown he with glory and honour .
thou madest he to have dominion over the work of thy hand ; thou hast put all thing under he foot :
all sheep and ox , yea , and the beast of the field ;
the fowl of the air , and the fish of the sea , and whatsoever passeth through the path of the sea .
o lord we lord , how excellent be thy name in all the earth !
i will praise thee , o lord , with my whole heart ; i will shew forth all thy marvellous work .
i will be glad and rejoice in thee : i will sing praise to thy name , o thou most high .
when mine enemy be turn back , they shall fall and perish at thy presence .
for thou hast maintain my right and my cause ; thou satest in the throne judge right .
thou hast rebuke the heathen , thou hast destroy the wicked , thou hast put out they name for ever and ever .
o thou enemy , destruction be come to a perpetual end : and thou hast destroy city ; they memorial be perish with they .
but the lord shall endure for ever : he have prepared he throne for judgment .
and he shall judge the world in righteousness , he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness .
the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed , a refuge in time of trouble .
and they that know thy name will put they trust in thee : for thou , lord , hast not forsake they that seek thee .
sing praise to the lord , which dwelleth in zion : declare among the people he doings .
when he maketh inquisition for blood , he remembereth they : he forgetteth not the cry of the humble .
have mercy upon i , o lord ; consider my trouble which i suffer of they that hate i , thou that liftest i up from the gate of death :
that i may shew forth all thy praise in the gate of the daughter of zion : i will rejoice in thy salvation .
the heathen be sink down in the pit that they make : in the net which they hide be they own foot take .
the lord be know by the judgment which he executeth : the wicked be snare in the work of he own hand .
higgaion .
selah .
the wicked shall be turn into hell , and all the nation that forget god .
for the needy shall not alway be forget : the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever .
arise , o lord ; let not man prevail : let the heathen be judge in thy sight .
put they in fear , o lord : that the nation may know themselves to be but man .
selah .
why standest thou afar off , o lord ? why hidest thou thyself in time of trouble ?
the wicked in he pride doth persecute the poor : let they be take in the device that they have imagine .
for the wicked boasteth of he heart 's desire , and blesseth the covetous , whom the lord abhorreth .
the wicked , through the pride of he countenance , will not seek after god : god be not in all he thought .
he way be always grievous ; thy judgment be far above out of he sight : as for all he enemy , he puffeth at they .
he have say in he heart , i shall not be move : for i shall never be in adversity .
he mouth be full of cursing and deceit and fraud : under he tongue be mischief and vanity .
he sitteth in the lurk place of the village : in the secret place doth he murder the innocent : he eye be privily set against the poor .
he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in he den : he lieth in wait to catch the poor : he doth catch the poor , when he draweth he into he net .
he croucheth , and humbleth himself , that the poor may fall by he strong one .
he have say in he heart , god have forget : he hideth he face ; he will never see it .
arise , o lord ; o god , lift up thine hand : forget not the humble .
wherefore doth the wicked contemn god ? he have say in he heart , thou wilt not require it .
thou hast see it ; for thou beholdest mischief and spite , to requite it with thy hand : the poor committeth himself unto thee ; thou art the helper of the fatherless .
break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man : seek out he wickedness till thou find none .
the lord be king for ever and ever : the heathen be perish out of he land .
lord , thou hast hear the desire of the humble : thou wilt prepare they heart , thou wilt cause thine ear to hear :
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed , that the man of the earth may no more oppress .
in the lord put i my trust : how say ye to my soul , flee as a bird to you mountain ?
for , lo , the wicked bend they bow , they make ready they arrow upon the string , that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart .
if the foundation be destroy , what can the righteous do ?
the lord be in he holy temple , the lord 's throne be in heaven : he eye behold , he eyelid try , the child of man .
the lord trieth the righteous : but the wicked and he that loveth violence he soul hateth .
upon the wicked he shall rain snare , fire and brimstone , and a horrible tempest : this shall be the portion of they cup .
for the righteous lord loveth righteousness ; he countenance doth behold the upright .
help , lord ; for the godly man ceaseth ; for the faithful fail from among the child of man .
they speak vanity every one with he neighbour : with flattering lip and with a double heart do they speak .
the lord shall cut off all flattering lip , and the tongue that speaketh proud thing :
who have say , with we tongue will we prevail ; we lip be we own : who be lord over we ?
for the oppression of the poor , for the sighing of the needy , now will i arise , saith the lord ; i will set he in safety from he that puffeth at he .
the word of the lord be pure word : as silver try in a furnace of earth , purify seven time .
thou shalt keep they , o lord , thou shalt preserve they from this generation for ever .
the wicked walk on every side , when the vilest man be exalt .
how long wilt thou forget i , o lord ? for ever ? how long wilt thou hide thy face from i ?
how long shall i take counsel in my soul , have sorrow in my heart daily ? how long shall mine enemy be exalt over i ?
consider and hear i , o lord my god : lighten mine eye , lest i sleep the sleep of death ;
lest mine enemy say , i have prevail against he ; and those that trouble i rejoice when i be move .
but i have trust in thy mercy ; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation .
i will sing unto the lord , because he have deal bountifully with i .
the fool have say in he heart , there be no god .
they be corrupt , they have do abominable work , there be none that doeth good .
the lord look down from heaven upon the child of man , to see if there be any that do understand , and seek god .
they be all go aside , they be all together become filthy : there be none that doeth good , no , not one .
have all the worker of iniquity no knowledge ? who eat up my people as they eat bread , and call not upon the lord .
there be they in great fear : for god be in the generation of the righteous .
ye have shame the counsel of the poor , because the lord be he refuge .
oh that the salvation of israel be come out of zion ! when the lord bringeth back the captivity of he people , jacob shall rejoice , and israel shall be glad .
lord , who shall abide in thy tabernacle ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?
he that walketh uprightly , and worketh righteousness , and speaketh the truth in he heart .
he that backbiteth not with he tongue , nor doeth evil to he neighbour , nor taketh up a reproach against he neighbour .
in whose eye a vile person be contemn ; but he honoureth they that fear the lord .
he that sweareth to he own hurt , and changeth not .
he that putteth not out he money to usury , nor taketh reward against the innocent .
he that doeth these thing shall never be move .
preserve i , o god : for in thee do i put my trust .
o my soul , thou hast say unto the lord , thou art my lord : my goodness extendeth not to thee ;
but to the saint that be in the earth , and to the excellent , in whom be all my delight .
they sorrow shall be multiply that hasten after another god : they drink offering of blood will i not offer , nor take up they name into my lip .
the lord be the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup : thou maintainest my lot .
the line be fall unto i in pleasant place ; yea , i have a goodly heritage .
i will bless the lord , who have give i counsel : my rein also instruct i in the night season .
i have set the lord always before i : because he be at my right hand , i shall not be move .
therefore my heart be glad , and my glory rejoiceth : my flesh also shall rest in hope .
for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell ; neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption .
thou wilt shew i the path of life : in thy presence be fulness of joy ; at thy right hand there be pleasure for evermore .
hear the right , o lord , attend unto my cry , give ear unto my prayer , that goeth not out of feigned lip .
let my sentence come forth from thy presence ; let thine eye behold the thing that be equal .
thou hast prove mine heart ; thou hast visit i in the night ; thou hast try i , and shalt find nothing ; i be purpose that my mouth shall not transgress .
concern the work of man , by the word of thy lip i have keep i from the path of the destroyer .
hold up my going in thy path , that my footstep slip not .
i have call upon thee , for thou wilt hear i , o god : incline thine ear unto i , and hear my speech .
shew thy marvellous lovingkindness , o thou that savest by thy right hand they which put they trust in thee from those that rise up against they .
keep i as the apple of the eye , hide i under the shadow of thy wing ,
from the wicked that oppress i , from my deadly enemy , who compass i about .
they be inclose in they own fat : with they mouth they speak proudly .
they have now compass we in we step : they have set they eye bow down to the earth ;
like as a lion that be greedy of he prey , and as it be a young lion lurk in secret place .
arise , o lord , disappoint he , cast he down : deliver my soul from the wicked , which be thy sword :
from man which be thy hand , o lord , from man of the world , which have they portion in this life , and whose belly thou fillest with thy hide treasure : they be full of child , and leave the rest of they substance to they babe .
as for i , i will behold thy face in righteousness : i shall be satisfy , when i awake , with thy likeness .
i will love thee , o lord , my strength .
the lord be my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my god , my strength , in whom i will trust ; my buckler , and the horn of my salvation , and my high tower .
i will call upon the lord , who be worthy to be praise : so shall i be save from mine enemy .
the sorrow of death compass i , and the flood of ungodly man make i afraid .
the sorrow of hell compass i about : the snare of death prevent i .
in my distress i call upon the lord , and cry unto my god : he hear my voice out of he temple , and my cry come before he , even into he ear .
then the earth shake and tremble ; the foundation also of the hill move and be shake , because he be wroth .
there go up a smoke out of he nostril , and fire out of he mouth devour : coal be kindle by it .
he bow the heaven also , and come down : and darkness be under he foot .
and he ride upon a cherub , and do fly : yea , he do fly upon the wing of the wind .
he make darkness he secret place ; he pavilion round about he be dark water and thick cloud of the sky .
at the brightness that be before he he thick cloud pass , hail stone and coal of fire .
the lord also thunder in the heaven , and the highest give he voice ; hail stone and coal of fire .
yea , he send out he arrow , and scatter they ; and he shoot out lightning , and discomfited they .
then the channel of water be see , and the foundation of the world be discover at thy rebuke , o lord , at the blast of the breath of thy nostril .
he send from above , he take i , he draw i out of many water .
he deliver i from my strong enemy , and from they which hate i : for they be too strong for i .
they prevent i in the day of my calamity : but the lord be my stay .
he bring i forth also into a large place ; he deliver i , because he delight in i .
the lord reward i accord to my righteousness ; accord to the cleanness of my hand have he recompense i .
for i have keep the way of the lord , and have not wickedly depart from my god .
for all he judgment be before i , and i do not put away he statute from i .
i be also upright before he , and i keep myself from mine iniquity .
therefore have the lord recompense i accord to my righteousness , accord to the cleanness of my hand in he eyesight .
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful ; with a upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright ;
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure ; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward .
for thou wilt save the afflict people ; but wilt bring down high look .
for thou wilt light my candle : the lord my god will enlighten my darkness .
for by thee i have run through a troop ; and by my god have i leap over a wall .
as for god , he way be perfect : the word of the lord be try : he be a buckler to all those that trust in he .
for who be god save the lord ? or who be a rock save we god ?
it be god that girdeth i with strength , and maketh my way perfect .
he maketh my foot like hind ' foot , and setteth i upon my high place .
he teacheth my hand to war , so that a bow of steel be break by mine arm .
thou hast also give i the shield of thy salvation : and thy right hand have holden i up , and thy gentleness have make i great .
thou hast enlarged my step under i , that my foot do not slip .
i have pursue mine enemy , and overtake they : neither do i turn again till they be consume .
i have wound they that they be not able to rise : they be fall under my foot .
for thou hast gird i with strength unto the battle : thou hast subdue under i those that rise up against i .
thou hast also give i the neck of mine enemy ; that i might destroy they that hate i .
they cry , but there be none to save they : even unto the lord , but he answer they not .
then do i beat they small as the dust before the wind : i do cast they out as the dirt in the street .
thou hast deliver i from the striving of the people ; and thou hast make i the head of the heathen : a people whom i have not know shall serve i .
as soon as they hear of i , they shall obey i : the stranger shall submit themselves unto i .
the stranger shall fade away , and be afraid out of they close place .
the lord liveth ; and bless be my rock ; and let the god of my salvation be exalt .
it be god that avengeth i , and subdueth the people under i .
he delivereth i from mine enemy : yea , thou liftest i up above those that rise up against i : thou hast deliver i from the violent man .
therefore will i give thanks unto thee , o lord , among the heathen , and sing praise unto thy name .
great deliverance giveth he to he king ; and sheweth mercy to he anointed , to david , and to he seed for evermore .
the heaven declare the glory of god ; and the firmament sheweth he handywork .
day unto day uttereth speech , and night unto night sheweth knowledge .
there be no speech nor language , where they voice be not hear .
they line be go out through all the earth , and they word to the end of the world .
in they have he set a tabernacle for the sun ,
which be as a bridegroom come out of he chamber , and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race .
he go forth be from the end of the heaven , and he circuit unto the end of it : and there be nothing hide from the heat thereof .
the law of the lord be perfect , convert the soul : the testimony of the lord be sure , make wise the simple .
the statute of the lord be right , rejoice the heart : the commandment of the lord be pure , enlighten the eye .
the fear of the lord be clean , endure for ever : the judgment of the lord be true and righteous altogether .
more to be desire be they than gold , yea , than much fine gold : sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb .
moreover by they be thy servant warn : and in keep of they there be great reward .
who can understand he error ? cleanse thou i from secret fault .
keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sin ; let they not have dominion over i : then shall i be upright , and i shall be innocent from the great transgression .
let the word of my mouth , and the meditation of my heart , be acceptable in thy sight , o lord , my strength , and my redeemer .
the lord hear thee in the day of trouble ; the name of the god of jacob defend thee ;
send thee help from the sanctuary , and strengthen thee out of zion ;
remember all thy offering , and accept thy burnt sacrifice ; selah .
grant thee accord to thine own heart , and fulfil all thy counsel .
we will rejoice in thy salvation , and in the name of we god we will set up we banner : the lord fulfil all thy petition .
now know i that the lord saveth he anoint ; he will hear he from he holy heaven with the saving strength of he right hand .
some trust in chariot , and some in horse : but we will remember the name of the lord we god .
they be bring down and fall : but we be rise , and stand upright .
save , lord : let the king hear we when we call .
the king shall joy in thy strength , o lord ; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice !
thou hast give he he heart 's desire , and hast not withholden the request of he lip .
selah .
for thou preventest he with the blessing of goodness : thou settest a crown of pure gold on he head .
he ask life of thee , and thou gavest it he , even length of day for ever and ever .
he glory be great in thy salvation : honour and majesty hast thou lay upon he .
for thou hast make he most bless for ever : thou hast make he exceed glad with thy countenance .
for the king trusteth in the lord , and through the mercy of the most high he shall not be move .
thine hand shall find out all thine enemy : thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee .
thou shalt make they as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger : the lord shall swallow they up in he wrath , and the fire shall devour they .
they fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth , and they seed from among the child of man .
for they intend evil against thee : they imagine a mischievous device , which they be not able to perform .
therefore shalt thou make they turn they back , when thou shalt make ready thine arrow upon thy string against the face of they .
be thou exalted , lord , in thine own strength : so will we sing and praise thy power .
my god , my god , why hast thou forsake i ? why art thou so far from help i , and from the word of my roaring ?
o my god , i cry in the day time , but thou hearest not ; and in the night season , and be not silent .
but thou art holy , o thou that inhabitest the praise of israel .
we father trust in thee : they trust , and thou didst deliver they .
they cry unto thee , and be deliver : they trust in thee , and be not confound .
but i be a worm , and no man ; a reproach of man , and despise of the people .
all they that see i laugh i to scorn : they shoot out the lip , they shake the head , say ,
he trust on the lord that he would deliver he : let he deliver he , see he delighted in he .
but thou art he that take i out of the womb : thou didst make i hope when i be upon my mother 's breast .
i be cast upon thee from the womb : thou art my god from my mother 's belly .
be not far from i ; for trouble be near ; for there be none to help .
many bull have compass i : strong bull of bashan have beset i round .
they gape upon i with they mouth , as a ravening and a roar lion .
i be pour out like water , and all my bone be out of joint : my heart be like wax ; it be melt in the midst of my bowels .
my strength be dry up like a potsherd ; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaw ; and thou hast bring i into the dust of death .
for dog have compass i : the assembly of the wicked have inclose i : they pierce my hand and my foot .
i may tell all my bone : they look and stare upon i .
they part my garment among they , and cast lot upon my vesture .
but be not thou far from i , o lord : o my strength , haste thee to help i .
deliver my soul from the sword ; my darling from the power of the dog .
save i from the lion 's mouth : for thou hast hear i from the horn of the unicorn .
i will declare thy name unto my brethren : in the midst of the congregation will i praise thee .
ye that fear the lord , praise he ; all ye the seed of jacob , glorify he ; and fear he , all ye the seed of israel .
for he have not despise nor abhor the affliction of the afflict ; neither have he hide he face from he ; but when he cry unto he , he hear .
my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation : i will pay my vow before they that fear he .
the meek shall eat and be satisfy : they shall praise the lord that seek he : you heart shall live for ever .
all the end of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord : and all the kindred of the nation shall worship before thee .
for the kingdom be the lord 's : and he be the governor among the nation .
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before he : and none can keep alive he own soul .
a seed shall serve he ; it shall be account to the lord for a generation .
they shall come , and shall declare he righteousness unto a people that shall be bear , that he have do this .
the lord be my shepherd ; i shall not want .
he maketh i to lie down in green pasture : he leadeth i beside the still water .
he restoreth my soul : he leadeth i in the path of righteousness for he name 's sake .
yea , though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death , i will fear no evil : for thou art with i ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort i .
thou preparest a table before i in the presence of mine enemy : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over .
surely goodness and mercy shall follow i all the day of my life : and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever .
the earth be the lord 's , and the fulness thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein .
for he have found it upon the sea , and establish it upon the flood .
who shall ascend into the hill of the lord ? or who shall stand in he holy place ?
he that have clean hand , and a pure heart ; who have not lift up he soul unto vanity , nor sworn deceitfully .
he shall receive the blessing from the lord , and righteousness from the god of he salvation .
this be the generation of they that seek he , that seek thy face , o jacob .
selah .
lift up you head , o ye gate ; and be ye lift up , ye everlasting door ; and the king of glory shall come in .
who be this king of glory ?
the lord strong and mighty , the lord mighty in battle .
lift up you head , o ye gate ; even lift they up , ye everlasting door ; and the king of glory shall come in .
who be this king of glory ?
the lord of host , he be the king of glory .
selah .
unto thee , o lord , do i lift up my soul .
o my god , i trust in thee : let i not be ashamed , let not mine enemy triumph over i .
yea , let none that wait on thee be ashamed : let they be ashamed which transgress without cause .
shew i thy way , o lord ; teach i thy path .
lead i in thy truth , and teach i : for thou art the god of my salvation ; on thee do i wait all the day .
remember , o lord , thy tender mercy and thy lovingkindness ; for they have be ever of old .
remember not the sin of my youth , nor my transgression : accord to thy mercy remember thou i for thy goodness ' sake , o lord .
good and upright be the lord : therefore will he teach sinner in the way .
the meek will he guide in judgment : and the meek will he teach he way .
all the path of the lord be mercy and truth unto such as keep he covenant and he testimony .
for thy name 's sake , o lord , pardon mine iniquity ; for it be great .
what man be he that feareth the lord ? he shall he teach in the way that he shall choose .
he soul shall dwell at ease ; and he seed shall inherit the earth .
the secret of the lord be with they that fear he ; and he will shew they he covenant .
mine eye be ever toward the lord ; for he shall pluck my foot out of the net .
turn thee unto i , and have mercy upon i ; for i be desolate and afflict .
the trouble of my heart be enlarged : o bring thou i out of my distress .
look upon mine affliction and my pain ; and forgive all my sin .
consider mine enemy ; for they be many ; and they hate i with cruel hatred .
o keep my soul , and deliver i : let i not be ashamed ; for i put my trust in thee .
let integrity and uprightness preserve i ; for i wait on thee .
redeem israel , o god , out of all he trouble .
judge i , o lord ; for i have walk in mine integrity : i have trust also in the lord ; therefore i shall not slide .
examine i , o lord , and prove i ; try my rein and my heart .
for thy lovingkindness be before mine eye : and i have walk in thy truth .
i have not sit with vain person , neither will i go in with dissembler .
i have hate the congregation of evil doer ; and will not sit with the wicked .
i will wash mine hand in innocency : so will i compass thine altar , o lord :
that i may publish with the voice of thanksgiving , and tell of all thy wondrous work .
lord , i have love the habitation of thy house , and the place where thine honour dwelleth .
gather not my soul with sinner , nor my life with bloody man :
in whose hand be mischief , and they right hand be full of bribe .
but as for i , i will walk in mine integrity : redeem i , and be merciful unto i .
my foot standeth in a even place : in the congregation will i bless the lord .
the lord be my light and my salvation ; whom shall i fear ? the lord be the strength of my life ; of whom shall i be afraid ?
when the wicked , even mine enemy and my foe , come upon i to eat up my flesh , they stumble and fall .
though a host should encamp against i , my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against i , in this will i be confident .
one thing have i desire of the lord , that will i seek after ; that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the day of my life , to behold the beauty of the lord , and to enquire in he temple .
for in the time of trouble he shall hide i in he pavilion : in the secret of he tabernacle shall he hide i ; he shall set i up upon a rock .
and now shall mine head be lift up above mine enemy round about i : therefore will i offer in he tabernacle sacrifice of joy ; i will sing , yea , i will sing praise unto the lord .
hear , o lord , when i cry with my voice : have mercy also upon i , and answer i .
when thou saidst , seek ye my face ; my heart say unto thee , thy face , lord , will i seek .
hide not thy face far from i ; put not thy servant away in anger : thou hast be my help ; leave i not , neither forsake i , o god of my salvation .
when my father and my mother forsake i , then the lord will take i up .
teach i thy way , o lord , and lead i in a plain path , because of mine enemy .
deliver i not over unto the will of mine enemy : for false witness be rise up against i , and such as breathe out cruelty .
i have faint , unless i have believe to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living .
wait on the lord : be of good courage , and he shall strengthen thine heart : wait , i say , on the lord .
unto thee will i cry , o lord my rock ; be not silent to i : lest , if thou be silent to i , i become like they that go down into the pit .
hear the voice of my supplication , when i cry unto thee , when i lift up my hand toward thy holy oracle .
draw i not away with the wicked , and with the worker of iniquity , which speak peace to they neighbour , but mischief be in they heart .
give they accord to they deed , and accord to the wickedness of they endeavour : give they after the work of they hand ; render to they they desert .
because they regard not the work of the lord , nor the operation of he hand , he shall destroy they , and not build they up .
bless be the lord , because he have hear the voice of my supplication .
the lord be my strength and my shield ; my heart trust in he , and i be help : therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth ; and with my song will i praise he .
the lord be they strength , and he be the save strength of he anointed .
save thy people , and bless thine inheritance : feed they also , and lift they up for ever .
give unto the lord , o ye mighty , give unto the lord glory and strength .
give unto the lord the glory due unto he name ; worship the lord in the beauty of holiness .
the voice of the lord be upon the water : the god of glory thundereth : the lord be upon many water .
the voice of the lord be powerful ; the voice of the lord be full of majesty .
the voice of the lord breaketh the cedar ; yea , the lord breaketh the cedar of lebanon .
he maketh they also to skip like a calf ; lebanon and sirion like a young unicorn .
the voice of the lord divideth the flame of fire .
the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness ; the lord shaketh the wilderness of kadesh .
the voice of the lord maketh the hind to calve , and discovereth the forest : and in he temple doth every one speak of he glory .
the lord sitteth upon the flood ; yea , the lord sitteth king for ever .
the lord will give strength unto he people ; the lord will bless he people with peace .
i will extol thee , o lord ; for thou hast lift i up , and hast not make my foe to rejoice over i .
o lord my god , i cry unto thee , and thou hast heal i .
o lord , thou hast bring up my soul from the grave : thou hast keep i alive , that i should not go down to the pit .
sing unto the lord , o ye saint of he , and give thanks at the remembrance of he holiness .
for he anger endureth but a moment ; in he favour be life : weep may endure for a night , but joy cometh in the morning .
and in my prosperity i say , i shall never be move .
lord , by thy favour thou hast make my mountain to stand strong : thou didst hide thy face , and i be trouble .
i cry to thee , o lord ; and unto the lord i make supplication .
what profit be there in my blood , when i go down to the pit ?
shall the dust praise thee ? shall it declare thy truth ?
hear , o lord , and have mercy upon i : lord , be thou my helper .
thou hast turn for i my mourning into dancing : thou hast put off my sackcloth , and gird i with gladness ;
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee , and not be silent .
o lord my god , i will give thanks unto thee for ever .
in thee , o lord , do i put my trust ; let i never be ashamed : deliver i in thy righteousness .
bow down thine ear to i ; deliver i speedily : be thou my strong rock , for a house of defence to save i .
for thou art my rock and my fortress ; therefore for thy name 's sake lead i , and guide i .
pull i out of the net that they have lay privily for i : for thou art my strength .
into thine hand i commit my spirit : thou hast redeem i , o lord god of truth .
i have hate they that regard lie vanity : but i trust in the lord .
i will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy : for thou hast consider my trouble ; thou hast know my soul in adversity ;
and hast not shut i up into the hand of the enemy : thou hast set my foot in a large room .
have mercy upon i , o lord , for i be in trouble : mine eye be consume with grief , yea , my soul and my belly .
for my life be spend with grief , and my year with sighing : my strength faileth because of mine iniquity , and my bone be consume .
i be a reproach among all mine enemy , but especially among my neighbour , and a fear to mine acquaintance : they that do see i without flee from i .
i be forget as a dead man out of mind : i be like a broken vessel .
for i have hear the slander of many : fear be on every side : while they take counsel together against i , they devise to take away my life .
but i trust in thee , o lord : i say , thou art my god .
my time be in thy hand : deliver i from the hand of mine enemy , and from they that persecute i .
make thy face to shine upon thy servant : save i for thy mercy ' sake .
let i not be ashamed , o lord ; for i have call upon thee : let the wicked be ashamed , and let they be silent in the grave .
let the lie lip be put to silence ; which speak grievous thing proudly and contemptuously against the righteous .
oh how great be thy goodness , which thou hast lay up for they that fear thee ; which thou hast work for they that trust in thee before the son of man !
thou shalt hide they in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep they secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongue .
bless be the lord : for he have shew i he marvellous kindness in a strong city .
for i say in my haste , i be cut off from before thine eye : nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplication when i cry unto thee .
o love the lord , all ye he saint : for the lord preserveth the faithful , and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer .
be of good courage , and he shall strengthen you heart , all ye that hope in the lord .
bless be he whose transgression be forgive , whose sin be cover .
bless be the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity , and in whose spirit there be no guile .
when i keep silence , my bone wax old through my roar all the day long .
for day and night thy hand be heavy upon i : my moisture be turn into the drought of summer .
selah .
i acknowledge my sin unto thee , and mine iniquity have i not hide .
i say , i will confess my transgression unto the lord ; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin .
selah .
for this shall every one that be godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be find : surely in the flood of great water they shall not come nigh unto he .
thou art my hiding place ; thou shalt preserve i from trouble ; thou shalt compass i about with song of deliverance .
selah .
i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go : i will guide thee with mine eye .
be ye not as the horse , or as the mule , which have no understanding : whose mouth must be hold in with bit and bridle , lest they come near unto thee .
many sorrow shall be to the wicked : but he that trusteth in the lord , mercy shall compass he about .
be glad in the lord , and rejoice , ye righteous : and shout for joy , all ye that be upright in heart .
rejoice in the lord , o ye righteous : for praise be comely for the upright .
praise the lord with harp : sing unto he with the psaltery and a instrument of ten string .
sing unto he a new song ; play skilfully with a loud noise .
for the word of the lord be right ; and all he work be do in truth .
he loveth righteousness and judgment : the earth be full of the goodness of the lord .
by the word of the lord be the heaven make ; and all the host of they by the breath of he mouth .
he gathereth the water of the sea together as a heap : he layeth up the depth in storehouse .
let all the earth fear the lord : let all the inhabitant of the world stand in awe of he .
for he speak , and it be do ; he command , and it stand fast .
the lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought : he maketh the device of the people of none effect .
the counsel of the lord standeth for ever , the thought of he heart to all generation .
bless be the nation whose god be the lord ; and the people whom he have choose for he own inheritance .
the lord looketh from heaven ; he beholdeth all the son of man .
from the place of he habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitant of the earth .
he fashioneth they heart alike ; he considereth all they work .
there be no king save by the multitude of a host : a mighty man be not deliver by much strength .
a horse be a vain thing for safety : neither shall he deliver any by he great strength .
behold , the eye of the lord be upon they that fear he , upon they that hope in he mercy ;
to deliver they soul from death , and to keep they alive in famine .
we soul waiteth for the lord : he be we help and we shield .
for we heart shall rejoice in he , because we have trust in he holy name .
let thy mercy , o lord , be upon we , accord as we hope in thee .
i will bless the lord at all time : he praise shall continually be in my mouth .
my soul shall make she boast in the lord : the humble shall hear thereof , and be glad .
o magnify the lord with i , and let we exalt he name together .
i seek the lord , and he hear i , and deliver i from all my fear .
they look unto he , and be lighten : and they face be not ashamed .
this poor man cry , and the lord hear he , and save he out of all he trouble .
the angel of the lord encampeth round about they that fear he , and delivereth they .
o taste and see that the lord be good : bless be the man that trusteth in he .
o fear the lord , ye he saint : for there be no want to they that fear he .
the young lion do lack , and suffer hunger : but they that seek the lord shall not want any good thing .
come , ye child , hearken unto i : i will teach you the fear of the lord .
what man be he that desireth life , and loveth many day , that he may see good ?
keep thy tongue from evil , and thy lip from speak guile .
depart from evil , and do good ; seek peace , and pursue it .
the eye of the lord be upon the righteous , and he ear be open unto they cry .
the face of the lord be against they that do evil , to cut off the remembrance of they from the earth .
the righteous cry , and the lord heareth , and delivereth they out of all they trouble .
the lord be nigh unto they that be of a broken heart ; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit .
many be the affliction of the righteous : but the lord delivereth he out of they all .
he keepeth all he bone : not one of they be break .
evil shall slay the wicked : and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate .
the lord redeemeth the soul of he servant : and none of they that trust in he shall be desolate .
plead my cause , o lord , with they that strive with i : fight against they that fight against i .
take hold of shield and buckler , and stand up for mine help .
draw out also the spear , and stop the way against they that persecute i : say unto my soul , i be thy salvation .
let they be confound and put to shame that seek after my soul : let they be turn back and bring to confusion that devise my hurt .
let they be as chaff before the wind : and let the angel of the lord chase they .
let they way be dark and slippery : and let the angel of the lord persecute they .
for without cause have they hide for i they net in a pit , which without cause they have dig for my soul .
let destruction come upon he at unaware ; and let he net that he have hide catch himself : into that very destruction let he fall .
and my soul shall be joyful in the lord : it shall rejoice in he salvation .
all my bone shall say , lord , who be like unto thee , which deliverest the poor from he that be too strong for he , yea , the poor and the needy from he that spoileth he ?
false witness do rise up ; they lay to my charge thing that i know not .
they reward i evil for good to the spoil of my soul .
but as for i , when they be sick , my clothing be sackcloth : i humble my soul with fasting ; and my prayer return into mine own bosom .
i behave myself as though he have be my friend or brother : i bow down heavily , as one that mourneth for he mother .
but in mine adversity they rejoice , and gather themselves together : yea , the abject gather themselves together against i , and i know it not ; they do tear i , and cease not :
with hypocritical mocker in feast , they gnash upon i with they tooth .
lord , how long wilt thou look on ? rescue my soul from they destruction , my darling from the lion .
i will give thee thanks in the great congregation : i will praise thee among much people .
let not they that be mine enemy wrongfully rejoice over i : neither let they wink with the eye that hate i without a cause .
for they speak not peace : but they devise deceitful matter against they that be quiet in the land .
yea , they open they mouth wide against i , and say , aha , aha , we eye have see it .
this thou hast see , o lord : keep not silence : o lord , be not far from i .
stir up thyself , and awake to my judgment , even unto my cause , my god and my lord .
judge i , o lord my god , accord to thy righteousness ; and let they not rejoice over i .
let they not say in they heart , ah , so would we have it : let they not say , we have swallow he up .
let they be ashamed and bring to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt : let they be clothe with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against i .
let they shout for joy , and be glad , that favour my righteous cause : yea , let they say continually , let the lord be magnify , which have pleasure in the prosperity of he servant .
and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long .
the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart , that there be no fear of god before he eye .
for he flattereth himself in he own eye , until he iniquity be find to be hateful .
the word of he mouth be iniquity and deceit : he have leave off to be wise , and to do good .
he deviseth mischief upon he bed ; he setteth himself in a way that be not good ; he abhorreth not evil .
thy mercy , o lord , be in the heaven ; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the cloud .
thy righteousness be like the great mountain ; thy judgment be a great deep : o lord , thou preservest man and beast .
how excellent be thy lovingkindness , o god ! therefore the child of man put they trust under the shadow of thy wing .
they shall be abundantly satisfy with the fatness of thy house ; and thou shalt make they drink of the river of thy pleasure .
for with thee be the fountain of life : in thy light shall we see light .
o continue thy lovingkindness unto they that know thee ; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart .
let not the foot of pride come against i , and let not the hand of the wicked remove i .
there be the worker of iniquity fall : they be cast down , and shall not be able to rise .
fret not thyself because of evildoer , neither be thou envious against the worker of iniquity .
for they shall soon be cut down like the grass , and wither as the green herb .
trust in the lord , and do good ; so shalt thou dwell in the land , and verily thou shalt be feed .
delight thyself also in the lord : and he shall give thee the desire of thine heart .
commit thy way unto the lord ; trust also in he ; and he shall bring it to pass .
and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light , and thy judgment as the noonday .
rest in the lord , and wait patiently for he : fret not thyself because of he who prospereth in he way , because of the man who bringeth wicked device to pass .
cease from anger , and forsake wrath : fret not thyself in any wise to do evil .
for evildoer shall be cut off : but those that wait upon the lord , they shall inherit the earth .
for yet a little while , and the wicked shall not be : yea , thou shalt diligently consider he place , and it shall not be .
but the meek shall inherit the earth ; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace .
the wicked plotteth against the just , and gnasheth upon he with he tooth .
the lord shall laugh at he : for he seeth that he day be come .
the wicked have draw out the sword , and have bent they bow , to cast down the poor and needy , and to slay such as be of upright conversation .
they sword shall enter into they own heart , and they bow shall be break .
a little that a righteous man have be better than the riches of many wicked .
for the arm of the wicked shall be break : but the lord upholdeth the righteous .
the lord knoweth the day of the upright : and they inheritance shall be for ever .
they shall not be ashamed in the evil time : and in the day of famine they shall be satisfy .
but the wicked shall perish , and the enemy of the lord shall be as the fat of lamb : they shall consume ; into smoke shall they consume away .
the wicked borroweth , and payeth not again : but the righteous sheweth mercy , and giveth .
for such as be bless of he shall inherit the earth ; and they that be curse of he shall be cut off .
the step of a good man be order by the lord : and he delighteth in he way .
though he fall , he shall not be utterly cast down : for the lord upholdeth he with he hand .
i have be young , and now be old ; yet have i not see the righteous forsake , nor he seed beg bread .
he be ever merciful , and lendeth ; and he seed be bless .
depart from evil , and do good ; and dwell for evermore .
for the lord loveth judgment , and forsaketh not he saint ; they be preserve for ever : but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off .
the righteous shall inherit the land , and dwell therein for ever .
the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom , and he tongue talketh of judgment .
the law of he god be in he heart ; none of he step shall slide .
the wicked watcheth the righteous , and seeketh to slay he .
the lord will not leave he in he hand , nor condemn he when he be judge .
wait on the lord , and keep he way , and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land : when the wicked be cut off , thou shalt see it .
i have see the wicked in great power , and spread himself like a green bay tree .
yet he pass away , and , lo , he be not : yea , i seek he , but he could not be find .
mark the perfect man , and behold the upright : for the end of that man be peace .
but the transgressor shall be destroy together : the end of the wicked shall be cut off .
but the salvation of the righteous be of the lord : he be they strength in the time of trouble .
and the lord shall help they , and deliver they : he shall deliver they from the wicked , and save they , because they trust in he .
o lord , rebuke i not in thy wrath : neither chasten i in thy hot displeasure .
for thine arrow stick fast in i , and thy hand presseth i sore .
there be no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger ; neither be there any rest in my bone because of my sin .
for mine iniquity be go over mine head : as a heavy burden they be too heavy for i .
my wound stink and be corrupt because of my foolishness .
i be trouble ; i be bow down greatly ; i go mourn all the day long .
for my loin be fill with a loathsome disease : and there be no soundness in my flesh .
i be feeble and sore break : i have roar by reason of the disquietness of my heart .
lord , all my desire be before thee ; and my groaning be not hide from thee .
my heart panteth , my strength faileth i : as for the light of mine eye , it also be go from i .
my lover and my friend stand aloof from my sore ; and my kinsman stand afar off .
they also that seek after my life lay snare for i : and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous thing , and imagine deceit all the day long .
but i , as a deaf man , hear not ; and i be as a dumb man that openeth not he mouth .
thus i be as a man that heareth not , and in whose mouth be no reproof .
for in thee , o lord , do i hope : thou wilt hear , o lord my god .
for i say , hear i , lest otherwise they should rejoice over i : when my foot slippeth , they magnify themselves against i .
for i be ready to halt , and my sorrow be continually before i .
for i will declare mine iniquity ; i will be sorry for my sin .
but mine enemy be lively , and they be strong : and they that hate i wrongfully be multiply .
they also that render evil for good be mine adversary ; because i follow the thing that good be .
forsake i not , o lord : o my god , be not far from i .
make haste to help i , o lord my salvation .
i say , i will take heed to my way , that i sin not with my tongue : i will keep my mouth with a bridle , while the wicked be before i .
i be dumb with silence , i hold my peace , even from good ; and my sorrow be stir .
my heart be hot within i , while i be muse the fire burn : then speak i with my tongue ,
lord , make i to know mine end , and the measure of my day , what it be : that i may know how frail i be .
behold , thou hast make my day as a handbreadth ; and mine age be as nothing before thee : verily every man at he best state be altogether vanity .
selah .
surely every man walketh in a vain shew : surely they be disquiet in vain : he heapeth up riches , and knoweth not who shall gather they .
and now , lord , what wait i for ? my hope be in thee .
deliver i from all my transgression : make i not the reproach of the foolish .
i be dumb , i open not my mouth ; because thou didst it .
remove thy stroke away from i : i be consume by the blow of thine hand .
when thou with rebuke dost correct man for iniquity , thou makest he beauty to consume away like a moth : surely every man be vanity .
selah .
hear my prayer , o lord , and give ear unto my cry ; hold not thy peace at my tear : for i be a stranger with thee , and a sojourner , as all my father be .
o spare i , that i may recover strength , before i go hence , and be no more .
i wait patiently for the lord ; and he incline unto i , and hear my cry .
he bring i up also out of a horrible pit , out of the miry clay , and set my foot upon a rock , and establish my going .
and he have put a new song in my mouth , even praise unto we god : many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in the lord .
bless be that man that maketh the lord he trust , and respecteth not the proud , nor such as turn aside to lie .
many , o lord my god , be thy wonderful work which thou hast do , and thy thought which be to us-ward : they can not be reckon up in order unto thee : if i would declare and speak of they , they be more than can be number .
sacrifice and offer thou didst not desire ; mine ear hast thou open : burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not require .
then say i , lo , i come : in the volume of the book it be write of i ,
i delight to do thy will , o my god : yea , thy law be within my heart .
i have preach righteousness in the great congregation : lo , i have not refrain my lip , o lord , thou knowest .
i have not hide thy righteousness within my heart ; i have declare thy faithfulness and thy salvation : i have not conceal thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation .
withhold not thou thy tender mercy from i , o lord : let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve i .
for innumerable evil have compass i about : mine iniquity have take hold upon i , so that i be not able to look up ; they be more than the hair of mine head : therefore my heart faileth i .
be pleased , o lord , to deliver i : o lord , make haste to help i .
let they be ashamed and confound together that seek after my soul to destroy it ; let they be drive backward and put to shame that wish i evil .
let they be desolate for a reward of they shame that say unto i , aha , aha .
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : let such as love thy salvation say continually , the lord be magnify .
but i be poor and needy ; yet the lord thinketh upon i : thou art my help and my deliverer ; make no tarrying , o my god .
bless be he that considereth the poor : the lord will deliver he in time of trouble .
the lord will preserve he , and keep he alive ; and he shall be bless upon the earth : and thou wilt not deliver he unto the will of he enemy .
the lord will strengthen he upon the bed of languish : thou wilt make all he bed in he sickness .
i say , lord , be merciful unto i : heal my soul ; for i have sin against thee .
mine enemy speak evil of i , when shall he die , and he name perish ?
and if he come to see i , he speaketh vanity : he heart gathereth iniquity to itself ; when he goeth abroad , he telleth it .
all that hate i whisper together against i : against i do they devise my hurt .
a evil disease , say they , cleaveth fast unto he : and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more .
yea , mine own familiar friend , in whom i trust , which do eat of my bread , have lift up he heel against i .
but thou , o lord , be merciful unto i , and raise i up , that i may requite they .
by this i know that thou favourest i , because mine enemy doth not triumph over i .
and as for i , thou upholdest i in mine integrity , and settest i before thy face for ever .
bless be the lord god of israel from everlasting , and to everlasting .
amen , and amen .
as the hart panteth after the water brook , so panteth my soul after thee , o god .
my soul thirsteth for god , for the living god : when shall i come and appear before god ?
my tear have be my meat day and night , while they continually say unto i , where be thy god ?
when i remember these thing , i pour out my soul in i : for i have go with the multitude , i go with they to the house of god , with the voice of joy and praise , with a multitude that keep holyday .
why art thou cast down , o my soul ? and why art thou disquiet in i ? hope thou in god : for i shall yet praise he for the help of he countenance .
o my god , my soul be cast down within i : therefore will i remember thee from the land of jordan , and of the hermonites , from the hill mizar .
deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspout : all thy wave and thy billow be go over i .
yet the lord will command he lovingkindness in the day time , and in the night he song shall be with i , and my prayer unto the god of my life .
i will say unto god my rock , why hast thou forget i ? why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
as with a sword in my bone , mine enemy reproach i ; while they say daily unto i , where be thy god ?
why art thou cast down , o my soul ? and why art thou disquiet within i ? hope thou in god : for i shall yet praise he , who be the health of my countenance , and my god .
judge i , o god , and plead my cause against a ungodly nation : o deliver i from the deceitful and unjust man .
for thou art the god of my strength : why dost thou cast i off ? why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
o send out thy light and thy truth : let they lead i ; let they bring i unto thy holy hill , and to thy tabernacle .
then will i go unto the altar of god , unto god my exceed joy : yea , upon the harp will i praise thee , o god my god .
why art thou cast down , o my soul ? and why art thou disquiet within i ? hope in god : for i shall yet praise he , who be the health of my countenance , and my god .
we have hear with we ear , o god , we father have tell we , what work thou didst in they day , in the time of old .
how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand , and plantedst they ; how thou didst afflict the people , and cast they out .
for they get not the land in possession by they own sword , neither do they own arm save they : but thy right hand , and thine arm , and the light of thy countenance , because thou hadst a favour unto they .
thou art my king , o god : command deliverance for jacob .
through thee will we push down we enemy : through thy name will we tread they under that rise up against we .
for i will not trust in my bow , neither shall my sword save i .
but thou hast save we from we enemy , and hast put they to shame that hate we .
in god we boast all the day long , and praise thy name for ever .
selah .
but thou hast cast off , and put we to shame ; and goest not forth with we army .
thou makest we to turn back from the enemy : and they which hate we spoil for themselves .
thou hast give we like sheep appoint for meat ; and hast scatter we among the heathen .
thou sellest thy people for nought , and dost not increase thy wealth by they price .
thou makest we a reproach to we neighbour , a scorn and a derision to they that be round about we .
thou makest we a byword among the heathen , a shake of the head among the people .
my confusion be continually before i , and the shame of my face have cover i ,
for the voice of he that reproacheth and blasphemeth ; by reason of the enemy and avenger .
all this be come upon we ; yet have we not forget thee , neither have we deal falsely in thy covenant .
we heart be not turn back , neither have we step decline from thy way ;
though thou hast sore broken we in the place of dragon , and cover we with the shadow of death .
if we have forget the name of we god , or stretch out we hand to a strange god ;
shall not god search this out ? for he knoweth the secret of the heart .
yea , for thy sake be we kill all the day long ; we be count as sheep for the slaughter .
awake , why sleepest thou , o lord ? arise , cast we not off for ever .
wherefore hidest thou thy face , and forgettest we affliction and we oppression ?
for we soul be bow down to the dust : we belly cleaveth unto the earth .
arise for we help , and redeem we for thy mercy ' sake .
my heart be indite a good matter : i speak of the thing which i have make touch the king : my tongue be the pen of a ready writer .
thou art fairer than the child of man : grace be pour into thy lip : therefore god have bless thee for ever .
gird thy sword upon thy thigh , o most mighty , with thy glory and thy majesty .
and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness ; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible thing .
thine arrow be sharp in the heart of the king 's enemy ; whereby the people fall under thee .
thy throne , o god , be for ever and ever : the sceptre of thy kingdom be a right sceptre .
thou lovest righteousness , and hatest wickedness : therefore god , thy god , have anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellow .
all thy garment smell of myrrh , and aloe , and cassium , out of the ivory palace , whereby they have make thee glad .
king ' daughter be among thy honourable woman : upon thy right hand do stand the queen in gold of ophir .
hearken , o daughter , and consider , and incline thine ear ; forget also thine own people , and thy father 's house ;
so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty : for he be thy lord ; and worship thou he .
and the daughter of tyre shall be there with a gift ; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour .
the king 's daughter be all glorious within : she clothing be of work gold .
she shall be bring unto the king in raiment of needlework : the virgin she companion that follow she shall be bring unto thee .
with gladness and rejoice shall they be bring : they shall enter into the king 's palace .
instead of thy father shall be thy child , whom thou mayest make prince in all the earth .
i will make thy name to be remember in all generation : therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever .
god be we refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .
therefore will not we fear , though the earth be remove , and though the mountain be carry into the midst of the sea ;
though the water thereof roar and be trouble , though the mountain shake with the swell thereof .
selah .
there be a river , the stream whereof shall make glad the city of god , the holy place of the tabernacle of the most high .
god be in the midst of she ; she shall not be move : god shall help she , and that right early .
the heathen rage , the kingdom be move : he utter he voice , the earth melt .
the lord of host be with we ; the god of jacob be we refuge .
selah .
come , behold the work of the lord , what desolation he have make in the earth .
he maketh war to cease unto the end of the earth ; he breaketh the bow , and cutteth the spear in sunder ; he burneth the chariot in the fire .
be still , and know that i be god : i will be exalt among the heathen , i will be exalt in the earth .
the lord of host be with we ; the god of jacob be we refuge .
selah .
o clap you hand , all ye people ; shout unto god with the voice of triumph .
for the lord most high be terrible ; he be a great king over all the earth .
he shall subdue the people under we , and the nation under we foot .
he shall choose we inheritance for we , the excellency of jacob whom he love .
selah .
god be go up with a shout , the lord with the sound of a trumpet .
sing praise to god , sing praise : sing praise unto we king , sing praise .
for god be the king of all the earth : sing ye praise with understanding .
god reigneth over the heathen : god sitteth upon the throne of he holiness .
the prince of the people be gather together , even the people of the god of abraham : for the shield of the earth belong unto god : he be greatly exalt .
great be the lord , and greatly to be praise in the city of we god , in the mountain of he holiness .
beautiful for situation , the joy of the whole earth , be mount zion , on the side of the north , the city of the great king .
god be know in she palace for a refuge .
for , lo , the king be assemble , they pass by together .
they see it , and so they marvel ; they be trouble , and hast away .
fear take hold upon they there , and pain , as of a woman in travail .
thou breakest the ship of tarshish with a east wind .
as we have hear , so have we see in the city of the lord of host , in the city of we god : god will establish it for ever .
selah .
we have think of thy lovingkindness , o god , in the midst of thy temple .
accord to thy name , o god , so be thy praise unto the end of the earth : thy right hand be full of righteousness .
let mount zion rejoice , let the daughter of judah be glad , because of thy judgment .
walk about zion , and go round about she : tell the tower thereof .
mark ye well she bulwark , consider she palace ; that ye may tell it to the generation follow .
for this god be we god for ever and ever : he will be we guide even unto death .
hear this , all ye people ; give ear , all ye inhabitant of the world :
both low and high , rich and poor , together .
my mouth shall speak of wisdom ; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding .
i will incline mine ear to a parable : i will open my dark say upon the harp .
wherefore should i fear in the day of evil , when the iniquity of my heel shall compass i about ?
they that trust in they wealth , and boast themselves in the multitude of they riches ;
none of they can by any means redeem he brother , nor give to god a ransom for he :
( for the redemption of they soul be precious , and it ceaseth for ever : )
that he should still live for ever , and not see corruption .
for he seeth that wise man die , likewise the fool and the brutish person perish , and leave they wealth to other .
they inward thought be , that they house shall continue for ever , and they dwelling place to all generation ; they call they land after they own name .
nevertheless man be in honour abideth not : he be like the beast that perish .
this they way be they folly : yet they posterity approve they saying .
selah .
like sheep they be lay in the grave ; death shall feed on they ; and the upright shall have dominion over they in the morning ; and they beauty shall consume in the grave from they dwelling .
but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave : for he shall receive i .
selah .
be not thou afraid when one be make rich , when the glory of he house be increase ;
for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away : he glory shall not descend after he .
though while he live he bless he soul : and man will praise thee , when thou doest well to thyself .
he shall go to the generation of he father ; they shall never see light .
man that be in honour , and understandeth not , be like the beast that perish .
the mighty god , even the lord , have speak , and call the earth from the rising of the sun unto the go down thereof .
out of zion , the perfection of beauty , god have shine .
we god shall come , and shall not keep silence : a fire shall devour before he , and it shall be very tempestuous round about he .
he shall call to the heaven from above , and to the earth , that he may judge he people .
gather my saint together unto i ; those that have make a covenant with i by sacrifice .
and the heaven shall declare he righteousness : for god be judge himself .
selah .
hear , o my people , and i will speak ; o israel , and i will testify against thee : i be god , even thy god .
i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifice or thy burnt offering , to have be continually before i .
i will take no bullock out of thy house , nor he goat out of thy fold .
for every beast of the forest be mine , and the cattle upon a thousand hill .
i know all the fowl of the mountain : and the wild beast of the field be mine .
if i be hungry , i would not tell thee : for the world be mine , and the fulness thereof .
will i eat the flesh of bull , or drink the blood of goat ?
offer unto god thanksgiving ; and pay thy vow unto the most high :
and call upon i in the day of trouble : i will deliver thee , and thou shalt glorify i .
but unto the wicked god saith , what hast thou to do to declare my statute , or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth ?
see thou hatest instruction , and casteth my word behind thee .
when thou sawest a thief , then thou consentedst with he , and hast be partaker with adulterer .
thou givest thy mouth to evil , and thy tongue frameth deceit .
thou sittest and speakest against thy brother ; thou slanderest thine own mother 's son .
these thing hast thou do , and i keep silence ; thou thoughtest that i be altogether such a one as thyself : but i will reprove thee , and set they in order before thine eye .
now consider this , ye that forget god , lest i tear you in piece , and there be none to deliver .
whoso offereth praise glorifieth i : and to he that ordereth he conversation aright will i shew the salvation of god .
have mercy upon i , o god , accord to thy lovingkindness : accord unto the multitude of thy tender mercy blot out my transgression .
wash i throughly from mine iniquity , and cleanse i from my sin .
for i acknowledge my transgression : and my sin be ever before i .
against thee , thee only , have i sin , and do this evil in thy sight : that thou mightest be justify when thou speakest , and be clear when thou judgest .
behold , i be shapen in iniquity ; and in sin do my mother conceive i .
behold , thou desirest truth in the inward part : and in the hidden part thou shalt make i to know wisdom .
purge i with hyssop , and i shall be clean : wash i , and i shall be whiter than snow .
make i to hear joy and gladness ; that the bone which thou hast break may rejoice .
hide thy face from my sin , and blot out all mine iniquity .
create in i a clean heart , o god ; and renew a right spirit within i .
cast i not away from thy presence ; and take not thy holy spirit from i .
restore unto i the joy of thy salvation ; and uphold i with thy free spirit .
then will i teach transgressor thy way ; and sinner shall be convert unto thee .
deliver i from bloodguiltiness , o god , thou god of my salvation : and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness .
o lord , open thou my lip ; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise .
for thou desirest not sacrifice ; else would i give it : thou delightest not in burnt offering .
the sacrifice of god be a broken spirit : a broken and a contrite heart , o god , thou wilt not despise .
do good in thy good pleasure unto zion : build thou the wall of jerusalem .
then shalt thou be please with the sacrifice of righteousness , with burnt offering and whole burnt offering : then shall they offer bullock upon thine altar .
why boastest thou thyself in mischief , o mighty man ? the goodness of god endureth continually .
thy tongue deviseth mischief ; like a sharp razor , work deceitfully .
thou lovest evil more than good ; and lie rather than to speak righteousness .
selah .
thou lovest all devour word , o thou deceitful tongue .
god shall likewise destroy thee for ever , he shall take thee away , and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place , and root thee out of the land of the living .
selah .
the righteous also shall see , and fear , and shall laugh at he :
lo , this be the man that make not god he strength ; but trust in the abundance of he riches , and strengthen himself in he wickedness .
but i be like a green olive tree in the house of god : i trust in the mercy of god for ever and ever .
i will praise thee for ever , because thou hast do it : and i will wait on thy name ; for it be good before thy saint .
the fool have say in he heart , there be no god .
corrupt be they , and have do abominable iniquity : there be none that doeth good .
god look down from heaven upon the child of man , to see if there be any that do understand , that do seek god .
every one of they be go back : they be altogether become filthy ; there be none that doeth good , no , not one .
have the worker of iniquity no knowledge ? who eat up my people as they eat bread : they have not call upon god .
there be they in great fear , where no fear be : for god have scatter the bone of he that encampeth against thee : thou hast put they to shame , because god have despise they .
oh that the salvation of israel be come out of zion !
when god bringeth back the captivity of he people , jacob shall rejoice , and israel shall be glad .
save i , o god , by thy name , and judge i by thy strength .
hear my prayer , o god ; give ear to the word of my mouth .
for stranger be rise up against i , and oppressor seek after my soul : they have not set god before they .
selah .
behold , god be mine helper : the lord be with they that uphold my soul .
he shall reward evil unto mine enemy : cut they off in thy truth .
i will freely sacrifice unto thee : i will praise thy name , o lord ; for it be good .
for he have deliver i out of all trouble : and mine eye have see he desire upon mine enemy .
give ear to my prayer , o god ; and hide not thyself from my supplication .
attend unto i , and hear i : i mourn in my complaint , and make a noise ;
because of the voice of the enemy , because of the oppression of the wicked : for they cast iniquity upon i , and in wrath they hate i .
my heart be sore pained within i : and the terror of death be fall upon i .
fearfulness and tremble be come upon i , and horror have overwhelm i .
and i say , oh that i have wing like a dive ! for then would i fly away , and be at rest .
lo , then would i wander far off , and remain in the wilderness .
selah .
i would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest .
destroy , o lord , and divide they tongue : for i have see violence and strife in the city .
day and night they go about it upon the wall thereof : mischief also and sorrow be in the midst of it .
wickedness be in the midst thereof : deceit and guile depart not from she street .
for it be not a enemy that reproach i ; then i could have bear it : neither be it he that hate i that do magnify himself against i ; then i would have hide myself from he :
but it be thou , a man mine equal , my guide , and mine acquaintance .
we take sweet counsel together , and walk unto the house of god in company .
let death seize upon they , and let they go down quick into hell : for wickedness be in they dwelling , and among they .
as for i , i will call upon god ; and the lord shall save i .
evening , and morning , and at noon , will i pray , and cry aloud : and he shall hear my voice .
he have deliver my soul in peace from the battle that be against i : for there be many with i .
god shall hear , and afflict they , even he that abideth of old .
selah .
because they have no change , therefore they fear not god .
he have put forth he hand against such as be at peace with he : he have broken he covenant .
the word of he mouth be smoother than butter , but war be in he heart : he word be softer than oil , yet be they draw sword .
cast thy burden upon the lord , and he shall sustain thee : he shall never suffer the righteous to be move .
but thou , o god , shalt bring they down into the pit of destruction : bloody and deceitful man shall not live out half they day ; but i will trust in thee .
be merciful unto i , o god : for man would swallow i up ; he fight daily oppresseth i .
mine enemy would daily swallow i up : for they be many that fight against i , o thou most high .
what time i be afraid , i will trust in thee .
in god i will praise he word , in god i have put my trust ; i will not fear what flesh can do unto i .
every day they wrest my word : all they thought be against i for evil .
they gather themselves together , they hide themselves , they mark my step , when they wait for my soul .
shall they escape by iniquity ? in thine anger cast down the people , o god .
thou tellest my wanderings : put thou my tear into thy bottle : be they not in thy book ?
when i cry unto thee , then shall mine enemy turn back : this i know ; for god be for i .
in god will i praise he word : in the lord will i praise he word .
in god have i put my trust : i will not be afraid what man can do unto i .
thy vow be upon i , o god : i will render praise unto thee .
for thou hast deliver my soul from death : wilt not thou deliver my foot from fall , that i may walk before god in the light of the living ?
be merciful unto i , o god , be merciful unto i : for my soul trusteth in thee : yea , in the shadow of thy wing will i make my refuge , until these calamity be overpast .
i will cry unto god most high ; unto god that performeth all thing for i .
he shall send from heaven , and save i from the reproach of he that would swallow i up .
selah .
god shall send forth he mercy and he truth .
my soul be among lion : and i lie even among they that be set on fire , even the son of man , whose tooth be spear and arrow , and they tongue a sharp sword .
be thou exalted , o god , above the heaven ; let thy glory be above all the earth .
they have prepare a net for my step ; my soul be bow down : they have dig a pit before i , into the midst whereof they be fall themselves .
selah .
my heart be fix , o god , my heart be fix : i will sing and give praise .
awake up , my glory ; awake , psaltery and harp : i myself will awake early .
i will praise thee , o lord , among the people : i will sing unto thee among the nation .
for thy mercy be great unto the heaven , and thy truth unto the cloud .
be thou exalted , o god , above the heaven : let thy glory be above all the earth .
do ye indeed speak righteousness , o congregation ? do ye judge uprightly , o ye son of man ?
yea , in heart ye work wickedness ; ye weigh the violence of you hand in the earth .
the wicked be estrange from the womb : they go astray as soon as they be bear , speak lie .
they poison be like the poison of a serpent : they be like the deaf adder that stoppeth she ear ;
which will not hearken to the voice of charmer , charming never so wisely .
break they tooth , o god , in they mouth : break out the great tooth of the young lion , o lord .
let they melt away as water which run continually : when he bendeth he bow to shoot he arrow , let they be as cut in piece .
as a snail which melteth , let every one of they pass away : like the untimely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun .
before you pot can feel the thorn , he shall take they away as with a whirlwind , both living , and in he wrath .
the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance : he shall wash he foot in the blood of the wicked .
so that a man shall say , verily there be a reward for the righteous : verily he be a god that judgeth in the earth .
deliver i from mine enemy , o my god : defend i from they that rise up against i .
deliver i from the worker of iniquity , and save i from bloody man .
for , lo , they lie in wait for my soul : the mighty be gather against i ; not for my transgression , nor for my sin , o lord .
they run and prepare themselves without my fault : awake to help i , and behold .
thou therefore , o lord god of host , the god of israel , awake to visit all the heathen : be not merciful to any wicked transgressor .
selah .
they return at evening : they make a noise like a dog , and go round about the city .
behold , they belch out with they mouth : sword be in they lip : for who , say they , doth hear ?
but thou , o lord , shalt laugh at they ; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision .
because of he strength will i wait upon thee : for god be my defence .
the god of my mercy shall prevent i : god shall let i see my desire upon mine enemy .
slay they not , lest my people forget : scatter they by thy power ; and bring they down , o lord we shield .
for the sin of they mouth and the word of they lip let they even be take in they pride : and for cursing and lie which they speak .
consume they in wrath , consume they , that they may not be : and let they know that god ruleth in jacob unto the end of the earth .
selah .
and at evening let they return ; and let they make a noise like a dog , and go round about the city .
let they wander up and down for meat , and grudge if they be not satisfy .
but i will sing of thy power ; yea , i will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning : for thou hast be my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble .
unto thee , o my strength , will i sing : for god be my defence , and the god of my mercy .
o god , thou hast cast we off , thou hast scatter we , thou hast be displeased ; o turn thyself to we again .
thou hast make the earth to tremble ; thou hast break it : heal the breach thereof ; for it shaketh .
thou hast shew thy people hard thing : thou hast make we to drink the wine of astonishment .
thou hast give a banner to they that fear thee , that it may be display because of the truth .
selah .
that thy beloved may be deliver ; save with thy right hand , and hear i .
god have speak in he holiness ; i will rejoice , i will divide shechem , and mete out the valley of succoth .
gilead be mine , and manasseh be mine ; ephraim also be the strength of mine head ; judah be my lawgiver ;
moab be my washpot ; over edom will i cast out my shoe : philistia , triumph thou because of i .
who will bring i into the strong city ? who will lead i into edom ?
wilt not thou , o god , which hadst cast we off ? and thou , o god , which do not go out with we army ?
give we help from trouble : for vain be the help of man .
through god we shall do valiantly : for he it be that shall tread down we enemy .
hear my cry , o god ; attend unto my prayer .
from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee , when my heart be overwhelm : lead i to the rock that be higher than i.
for thou hast be a shelter for i , and a strong tower from the enemy .
i will abide in thy tabernacle for ever : i will trust in the covert of thy wing .
selah .
for thou , o god , hast hear my vow : thou hast give i the heritage of those that fear thy name .
thou wilt prolong the king 's life : and he year as many generation .
he shall abide before god for ever : o prepare mercy and truth , which may preserve he .
so will i sing praise unto thy name for ever , that i may daily perform my vow .
truly my soul waiteth upon god : from he cometh my salvation .
he only be my rock and my salvation ; he be my defence ; i shall not be greatly move .
how long will ye imagine mischief against a man ? ye shall be slay all of you : as a bow wall shall ye be , and as a totter fence .
they only consult to cast he down from he excellency : they delight in lie : they bless with they mouth , but they curse inwardly .
selah .
my soul , wait thou only upon god ; for my expectation be from he .
he only be my rock and my salvation : he be my defence ; i shall not be move .
in god be my salvation and my glory : the rock of my strength , and my refuge , be in god .
trust in he at all time ; ye people , pour out you heart before he : god be a refuge for we .
selah .
surely man of low degree be vanity , and man of high degree be a lie : to be lay in the balance , they be altogether lighter than vanity .
trust not in oppression , and become not vain in robbery : if riches increase , set not you heart upon they .
god have speak once ; twice have i hear this ; that power belongeth unto god .
also unto thee , o lord , belongeth mercy : for thou renderest to every man accord to he work .
o god , thou art my god ; early will i seek thee : my soul thirsteth for thee , my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land , where no water be ;
to see thy power and thy glory , so as i have see thee in the sanctuary .
because thy lovingkindness be better than life , my lip shall praise thee .
thus will i bless thee while i live : i will lift up my hand in thy name .
my soul shall be satisfy as with marrow and fatness ; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lip :
when i remember thee upon my bed , and meditate on thee in the night watch .
because thou hast be my help , therefore in the shadow of thy wing will i rejoice .
my soul followeth hard after thee : thy right hand upholdeth i .
but those that seek my soul , to destroy it , shall go into the lower part of the earth .
they shall fall by the sword : they shall be a portion for fox .
but the king shall rejoice in god ; every one that sweareth by he shall glory : but the mouth of they that speak lie shall be stop .
hear my voice , o god , in my prayer : preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
hide i from the secret counsel of the wicked ; from the insurrection of the worker of iniquity :
who whet they tongue like a sword , and bend they bow to shoot they arrow , even bitter word :
that they may shoot in secret at the perfect : suddenly do they shoot at he , and fear not .
they encourage themselves in a evil matter : they commune of lay snare privily ; they say , who shall see they ?
they search out iniquity ; they accomplish a diligent search : both the inward thought of every one of they , and the heart , be deep .
but god shall shoot at they with a arrow ; suddenly shall they be wound .
so they shall make they own tongue to fall upon themselves : all that see they shall flee away .
and all man shall fear , and shall declare the work of god ; for they shall wisely consider of he do .
the righteous shall be glad in the lord , and shall trust in he ; and all the upright in heart shall glory .
praise waiteth for thee , o god , in sion : and unto thee shall the vow be perform .
o thou that hearest prayer , unto thee shall all flesh come .
iniquity prevail against i : as for we transgression , thou shalt purge they away .
bless be the man whom thou choosest , and causest to approach unto thee , that he may dwell in thy court : we shall be satisfy with the goodness of thy house , even of thy holy temple .
by terrible thing in righteousness wilt thou answer we , o god of we salvation ; who art the confidence of all the end of the earth , and of they that be afar off upon the sea :
which by he strength setteth fast the mountain ; be gird with power :
which stilleth the noise of the sea , the noise of they wave , and the tumult of the people .
they also that dwell in the uttermost part be afraid at thy token : thou makest the outgoing of the morning and evening to rejoice .
thou visitest the earth , and waterest it : thou greatly enrichest it with the river of god , which be full of water : thou preparest they corn , when thou hast so provide for it .
thou waterest the ridge thereof abundantly : thou settlest the furrow thereof : thou makest it soft with shower : thou blessest the spring thereof .
thou crownest the year with thy goodness ; and thy path drop fatness .
they drop upon the pasture of the wilderness : and the little hill rejoice on every side .
the pasture be clothe with flock ; the valley also be cover over with corn ; they shout for joy , they also sing .
make a joyful noise unto god , all ye land :
sing forth the honour of he name : make he praise glorious .
say unto god , how terrible art thou in thy work ! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemy submit themselves unto thee .
all the earth shall worship thee , and shall sing unto thee ; they shall sing to thy name .
selah .
come and see the work of god : he be terrible in he do toward the child of man .
he turn the sea into dry land : they go through the flood on foot : there do we rejoice in he .
he ruleth by he power for ever ; he eye behold the nation : let not the rebellious exalt themselves .
selah .
o bless we god , ye people , and make the voice of he praise to be hear :
which holdeth we soul in life , and suffereth not we foot to be move .
for thou , o god , hast prove we : thou hast try we , as silver be try .
thou broughtest we into the net ; thou laidst affliction upon we loin .
thou hast cause man to ride over we head ; we go through fire and through water : but thou broughtest we out into a wealthy place .
i will go into thy house with burnt offering : i will pay thee my vow ,
which my lip have utter , and my mouth have speak , when i be in trouble .
i will offer unto thee burnt sacrifice of fatling , with the incense of ram ; i will offer bullock with goat .
selah .
come and hear , all ye that fear god , and i will declare what he have do for my soul .
i cry unto he with my mouth , and he be extol with my tongue .
if i regard iniquity in my heart , the lord will not hear i :
but verily god have hear i ; he have attend to the voice of my prayer .
bless be god , which have not turn away my prayer , nor he mercy from i .
god be merciful unto we , and bless we ; and cause he face to shine upon we ; selah .
that thy way may be know upon earth , thy saving health among all nation .
let the people praise thee , o god ; let all the people praise thee .
o let the nation be glad and sing for joy : for thou shalt judge the people righteously , and govern the nation upon earth .
selah .
let the people praise thee , o god ; let all the people praise thee .
then shall the earth yield she increase ; and god , even we own god , shall bless we .
god shall bless we ; and all the end of the earth shall fear he .
let god arise , let he enemy be scatter : let they also that hate he flee before he .
as smoke be drive away , so drive they away : as wax melteth before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of god .
but let the righteous be glad ; let they rejoice before god : yea , let they exceedingly rejoice .
sing unto god , sing praise to he name : extol he that rideth upon the heaven by he name jah , and rejoice before he .
a father of the fatherless , and a judge of the widow , be god in he holy habitation .
god setteth the solitary in family : he bringeth out those which be bind with chain : but the rebellious dwell in a dry land .
o god , when thou wentest forth before thy people , when thou didst march through the wilderness ; selah :
the earth shake , the heaven also drop at the presence of god : even sinai itself be move at the presence of god , the god of israel .
thou , o god , didst send a plentiful rain , whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance , when it be weary .
thy congregation have dwelt therein : thou , o god , hast prepare of thy goodness for the poor .
the lord give the word : great be the company of those that publish it .
king of army do flee apace : and she that tarry at home divide the spoil .
though ye have lien among the pot , yet shall ye be as the wing of a dive cover with silver , and she feather with yellow gold .
when the almighty scatter king in it , it be white as snow in salmon .
the hill of god be as the hill of bashan ; a high hill as the hill of bashan .
why leap ye , ye high hill ? this be the hill which god desireth to dwell in ; yea , the lord will dwell in it for ever .
the chariot of god be twenty thousand , even thousand of angel : the lord be among they , as in sinai , in the holy place .
thou hast ascend on high , thou hast lead captivity captive : thou hast receive gift for man ; yea , for the rebellious also , that the lord god might dwell among they .
bless be the lord , who daily loadeth we with benefit , even the god of we salvation .
selah .
he that be we god be the god of salvation ; and unto god the lord belong the issue from death .
but god shall wind the head of he enemy , and the hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in he trespass .
the lord say , i will bring again from bashan , i will bring my people again from the depths of the sea :
that thy foot may be dip in the blood of thine enemy , and the tongue of thy dog in the same .
they have see thy going , o god ; even the going of my god , my king , in the sanctuary .
the singer go before , the player on instrument follow after ; among they be the damsel play with timbrel .
bless ye god in the congregation , even the lord , from the fountain of israel .
there be little benjamin with they ruler , the prince of judah and they council , the prince of zebulun , and the prince of naphtali .
thy god have command thy strength : strengthen , o god , that which thou hast work for we .
because of thy temple at jerusalem shall king bring present unto thee .
rebuke the company of spearman , the multitude of the bull , with the calf of the people , till every one submit himself with piece of silver : scatter thou the people that delight in war .
princes shall come out of egypt ; ethiopia shall soon stretch out she hand unto god .
sing unto god , ye kingdom of the earth ; o sing praise unto the lord ; selah :
to he that rideth upon the heaven of heaven , which be of old ; lo , he doth send out he voice , and that a mighty voice .
ascribe ye strength unto god : he excellency be over israel , and he strength be in the cloud .
o god , thou art terrible out of thy holy place : the god of israel be he that giveth strength and power unto he people .
bless be god .
save i , o god ; for the water be come in unto my soul .
i sink in deep mire , where there be no standing : i be come into deep water , where the flood overflow i .
i be weary of my cry : my throat be dry : mine eye fail while i wait for my god .
they that hate i without a cause be more than the hair of mine head : they that would destroy i , be mine enemy wrongfully , be mighty : then i restore that which i take not away .
o god , thou knowest my foolishness ; and my sin be not hide from thee .
let not they that wait on thee , o lord god of host , be ashamed for my sake : let not those that seek thee be confound for my sake , o god of israel .
because for thy sake i have bear reproach ; shame have cover my face .
i be become a stranger unto my brethren , and a alien unto my mother 's child .
for the zeal of thine house have eat i up ; and the reproach of they that reproach thee be fall upon i .
when i weep , and chasten my soul with fasting , that be to my reproach .
i make sackcloth also my garment ; and i become a proverb to they .
they that sit in the gate speak against i ; and i be the song of the drunkard .
but as for i , my prayer be unto thee , o lord , in a acceptable time : o god , in the multitude of thy mercy hear i , in the truth of thy salvation .
deliver i out of the mire , and let i not sink : let i be deliver from they that hate i , and out of the deep water .
let not the waterflood overflow i , neither let the deep swallow i up , and let not the pit shut she mouth upon i .
hear i , o lord ; for thy lovingkindness be good : turn unto i accord to the multitude of thy tender mercy .
and hide not thy face from thy servant ; for i be in trouble : hear i speedily .
draw nigh unto my soul , and redeem it : deliver i because of mine enemy .
thou hast know my reproach , and my shame , and my dishonour : mine adversary be all before thee .
reproach have broken my heart ; and i be full of heaviness : and i look for some to take pity , but there be none ; and for comforter , but i find none .
they give i also gall for my meat ; and in my thirst they give i vinegar to drink .
let they table become a snare before they : and that which should have be for they welfare , let it become a trap .
let they eye be darken , that they see not ; and make they loin continually to shake .
pour out thine indignation upon they , and let thy wrathful anger take hold of they .
let they habitation be desolate ; and let none dwell in they tent .
for they persecute he whom thou hast smitten ; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wound .
add iniquity unto they iniquity : and let they not come into thy righteousness .
let they be blot out of the book of the living , and not be write with the righteous .
but i be poor and sorrowful : let thy salvation , o god , set i up on high .
i will praise the name of god with a song , and will magnify he with thanksgiving .
this also shall please the lord better than a ox or bullock that have horn and hoof .
the humble shall see this , and be glad : and you heart shall live that seek god .
for the lord heareth the poor , and despiseth not he prisoner .
let the heaven and earth praise he , the sea , and every thing that moveth therein .
for god will save zion , and will build the city of judah : that they may dwell there , and have it in possession .
the seed also of he servant shall inherit it : and they that love he name shall dwell therein .
make haste , o god , to deliver i ; make haste to help i , o lord .
let they be ashamed and confound that seek after my soul : let they be turn backward , and put to confusion , that desire my hurt .
let they be turn back for a reward of they shame that say , aha , aha .
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : and let such as love thy salvation say continually , let god be magnify .
but i be poor and needy : make haste unto i , o god : thou art my help and my deliverer ; o lord , make no tarry .
in thee , o lord , do i put my trust : let i never be put to confusion .
deliver i in thy righteousness , and cause i to escape : incline thine ear unto i , and save i .
be thou my strong habitation , whereunto i may continually resort : thou hast give commandment to save i ; for thou art my rock and my fortress .
deliver i , o my god , out of the hand of the wicked , out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man .
for thou art my hope , o lord god : thou art my trust from my youth .
by thee have i be holden up from the womb : thou art he that take i out of my mother 's bowels : my praise shall be continually of thee .
i be as a wonder unto many ; but thou art my strong refuge .
let my mouth be fill with thy praise and with thy honour all the day .
cast i not off in the time of old age ; forsake i not when my strength faileth .
for mine enemy speak against i ; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together ,
say , god have forsake he : persecute and take he ; for there be none to deliver he .
o god , be not far from i : o my god , make haste for my help .
let they be confound and consume that be adversary to my soul ; let they be cover with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt .
but i will hope continually , and will yet praise thee more and more .
my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day ; for i know not the number thereof .
i will go in the strength of the lord god : i will make mention of thy righteousness , even of thine only .
o god , thou hast teach i from my youth : and hitherto have i declare thy wondrous work .
now also when i be old and greyhead , o god , forsake i not ; until i have shew thy strength unto this generation , and thy power to every one that be to come .
thy righteousness also , o god , be very high , who hast do great thing : o god , who be like unto thee !
thou , which hast shewed i great and sore trouble , shalt quicken i again , and shalt bring i up again from the depths of the earth .
thou shalt increase my greatness , and comfort i on every side .
i will also praise thee with the psaltery , even thy truth , o my god : unto thee will i sing with the harp , o thou holy one of israel .
my lip shall greatly rejoice when i sing unto thee ; and my soul , which thou hast redeem .
my tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long : for they be confound , for they be bring unto shame , that seek my hurt .
give the king thy judgment , o god , and thy righteousness unto the king 's son .
he shall judge thy people with righteousness , and thy poor with judgment .
the mountain shall bring peace to the people , and the little hill , by righteousness .
he shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the child of the needy , and shall break in piece the oppressor .
they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure , throughout all generation .
he shall come down like rain upon the mown grass : as shower that water the earth .
in he day shall the righteous flourish ; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth .
he shall have dominion also from sea to sea , and from the river unto the end of the earth .
they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before he ; and he enemy shall lick the dust .
the king of tarshish and of the isle shall bring present : the king of sheba and seba shall offer gift .
yea , all king shall fall down before he : all nation shall serve he .
for he shall deliver the needy when he crieth ; the poor also , and he that have no helper .
he shall spare the poor and needy , and shall save the soul of the needy .
he shall redeem they soul from deceit and violence : and precious shall they blood be in he sight .
and he shall live , and to he shall be give of the gold of sheba : prayer also shall be make for he continually ; and daily shall he be praise .
there shall be a handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountain ; the fruit thereof shall shake like lebanon : and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth .
he name shall endure for ever : he name shall be continue as long as the sun : and man shall be bless in he : all nation shall call he bless .
bless be the lord god , the god of israel , who only doeth wondrous thing .
and bless be he glorious name for ever : and let the whole earth be fill with he glory ; amen , and amen .
the prayer of david the son of jesse be end .
truly god be good to israel , even to such as be of a clean heart .
but as for i , my foot be almost go ; my step have well nigh slip .
for i be envious at the foolish , when i see the prosperity of the wicked .
for there be no band in they death : but they strength be firm .
they be not in trouble as other man ; neither be they plague like other man .
therefore pride compasseth they about as a chain ; violence covereth they as a garment .
they eye stand out with fatness : they have more than heart could wish .
they be corrupt , and speak wickedly concern oppression : they speak loftily .
they set they mouth against the heaven , and they tongue walketh through the earth .
therefore he people return hither : and water of a full cup be wring out to they .
and they say , how doth god know ? and be there knowledge in the most high ?
behold , these be the ungodly , who prosper in the world ; they increase in riches .
verily i have cleanse my heart in vain , and wash my hand in innocency .
for all the day long have i be plague , and chasten every morning .
if i say , i will speak thus ; behold , i should offend against the generation of thy child .
when i think to know this , it be too painful for i ;
until i go into the sanctuary of god ; then understand i they end .
surely thou didst set they in slippery place : thou castedst they down into destruction .
how be they bring into desolation , as in a moment ! they be utterly consume with terror .
as a dream when one awaketh ; so , o lord , when thou awakest , thou shalt despise they image .
thus my heart be grieve , and i be prick in my rein .
so foolish be i , and ignorant : i be as a beast before thee .
nevertheless i be continually with thee : thou hast holden i by my right hand .
thou shalt guide i with thy counsel , and afterward receive i to glory .
whom have i in heaven but thee ? and there be none upon earth that i desire beside thee .
my flesh and my heart faileth : but god be the strength of my heart , and my portion for ever .
for , lo , they that be far from thee shall perish : thou hast destroy all they that go a whoring from thee .
but it be good for i to draw near to god : i have put my trust in the lord god , that i may declare all thy work .
o god , why hast thou cast we off for ever ? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture ?
remember thy congregation , which thou hast purchase of old ; the rod of thine inheritance , which thou hast redeem ; this mount zion , wherein thou hast dwelt .
lift up thy foot unto the perpetual desolation ; even all that the enemy have do wickedly in the sanctuary .
thine enemy roar in the midst of thy congregation ; they set up they ensign for sign .
a man be famous accord as he have lift up axis upon the thick tree .
but now they break down the carve work thereof at once with axis and hammer .
they have cast fire into thy sanctuary , they have defile by cast down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground .
they say in they heart , let we destroy they together : they have burn up all the synagogue of god in the land .
we see not we sign : there be no more any prophet : neither be there among we any that knoweth how long .
o god , how long shall the adversary reproach ? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever ?
why withdrawest thou thy hand , even thy right hand ? pluck it out of thy bosom .
for god be my king of old , work salvation in the midst of the earth .
thou didst divide the sea by thy strength : thou brakest the head of the dragon in the water .
thou brakest the head of leviathan in piece , and gavest he to be meat to the people inhabit the wilderness .
thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood : thou driedst up mighty river .
the day be thine , the night also be thine : thou hast prepare the light and the sun .
thou hast set all the border of the earth : thou hast make summer and winter .
remember this , that the enemy have reproach , o lord , and that the foolish people have blaspheme thy name .
o deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked : forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever .
have respect unto the covenant : for the dark place of the earth be full of the habitation of cruelty .
o let not the oppressed return ashamed : let the poor and needy praise thy name .
arise , o god , plead thine own cause : remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily .
forget not the voice of thine enemy : the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually .
unto thee , o god , do we give thanks , unto thee do we give thanks : for that thy name be near thy wondrous work declare .
when i shall receive the congregation i will judge uprightly .
the earth and all the inhabitant thereof be dissolve : i bear up the pillar of it .
selah .
i say unto the fool , deal not foolishly : and to the wicked , lift not up the horn :
lift not up you horn on high : speak not with a stiff neck .
for promotion cometh neither from the east , nor from the west , nor from the south .
but god be the judge : he putteth down one , and setteth up another .
for in the hand of the lord there be a cup , and the wine be red ; it be full of mixture ; and he poureth out of the same : but the dregs thereof , all the wicked of the earth shall wring they out , and drink they .
but i will declare for ever ; i will sing praise to the god of jacob .
all the horn of the wicked also will i cut off ; but the horn of the righteous shall be exalt .
in judah be god know : he name be great in israel .
in salem also be he tabernacle , and he dwelling place in zion .
there brake he the arrow of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the battle .
selah .
thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountain of prey .
the stouthearted be spoil , they have sleep they sleep : and none of the man of might have find they hand .
at thy rebuke , o god of jacob , both the chariot and horse be cast into a dead sleep .
thou , even thou , art to be fear : and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry ?
thou didst cause judgment to be hear from heaven ; the earth fear , and be still ,
when god arise to judgment , to save all the meek of the earth .
selah .
surely the wrath of man shall praise thee : the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain .
vow , and pay unto the lord you god : let all that be round about he bring present unto he that ought to be fear .
he shall cut off the spirit of prince : he be terrible to the king of the earth .
i cry unto god with my voice , even unto god with my voice ; and he give ear unto i .
in the day of my trouble i seek the lord : my sore run in the night , and cease not : my soul refuse to be comfort .
i remember god , and be trouble : i complain , and my spirit be overwhelm .
selah .
thou holdest mine eye wake : i be so troubled that i can not speak .
i have consider the day of old , the year of ancient time .
i call to remembrance my song in the night : i commune with mine own heart : and my spirit make diligent search .
will the lord cast off for ever ? and will he be favourable no more ?
be he mercy clean go for ever ? doth he promise fail for evermore ?
hath god forget to be gracious ? have he in anger shut up he tender mercy ?
selah .
and i say , this be my infirmity : but i will remember the year of the right hand of the most high .
i will remember the work of the lord : surely i will remember thy wonder of old .
i will meditate also of all thy work , and talk of thy doings .
thy way , o god , be in the sanctuary : who be so great a god as we god ?
thou art the god that doest wonder : thou hast declare thy strength among the people .
thou hast with thine arm redeem thy people , the son of jacob and joseph .
selah .
the water see thee , o god , the water see thee ; they be afraid : the depths also be trouble .
the cloud pour out water : the sky send out a sound : thine arrow also go abroad .
the voice of thy thunder be in the heaven : the lightning lighten the world : the earth tremble and shake .
thy way be in the sea , and thy path in the great water , and thy footstep be not know .
thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron .
give ear , o my people , to my law : incline you ear to the word of my mouth .
i will open my mouth in a parable : i will utter dark saying of old :
which we have hear and know , and we father have tell we .
we will not hide they from they child , shew to the generation to come the praise of the lord , and he strength , and he wonderful work that he have do .
for he establish a testimony in jacob , and appoint a law in israel , which he command we father , that they should make they know to they child :
that the generation to come might know they , even the child which should be bear ; who should arise and declare they to they child :
that they might set they hope in god , and not forget the work of god , but keep he commandment :
and might not be as they father , a stubborn and rebellious generation ; a generation that set not they heart aright , and whose spirit be not stedfast with god .
the child of ephraim , be arm , and carry bow , turn back in the day of battle .
they keep not the covenant of god , and refuse to walk in he law ;
and forgat he work , and he wonder that he have shew they .
marvellous thing do he in the sight of they father , in the land of egypt , in the field of zoan .
he divide the sea , and cause they to pass through ; and he make the water to stand as a heap .
in the daytime also he lead they with a cloud , and all the night with a light of fire .
he cleave the rock in the wilderness , and give they drink as out of the great depths .
he bring stream also out of the rock , and cause water to run down like river .
and they sin yet more against he by provoke the most high in the wilderness .
and they tempt god in they heart by ask meat for they lust .
yea , they speak against god ; they say , can god furnish a table in the wilderness ?
behold , he smite the rock , that the water gush out , and the stream overflow ; can he give bread also ? can he provide flesh for he people ?
therefore the lord hear this , and be wroth : so a fire be kindle against jacob , and anger also come up against israel ;
because they believe not in god , and trust not in he salvation :
though he have command the cloud from above , and open the door of heaven ,
and have rain down manna upon they to eat , and have give they of the corn of heaven .
man do eat angel ' food : he send they meat to the full .
he cause a east wind to blow in the heaven : and by he power he bring in the south wind .
he rain flesh also upon they as dust , and feathered fowl like as the sand of the sea :
and he let it fall in the midst of they camp , round about they habitation .
so they do eat , and be well fill : for he give they they own desire ;
they be not estrange from they lust .
but while they meat be yet in they mouth ,
the wrath of god come upon they , and slew the fattest of they , and smite down the choose man of israel .
for all this they sin still , and believe not for he wondrous work .
therefore they day do he consume in vanity , and they year in trouble .
when he slew they , then they seek he : and they return and enquire early after god .
and they remember that god be they rock , and the high god they redeemer .
nevertheless they do flatter he with they mouth , and they lie unto he with they tongue .
for they heart be not right with he , neither be they stedfast in he covenant .
but he , be full of compassion , forgive they iniquity , and destroy they not : yea , many a time turn he he anger away , and do not stir up all he wrath .
for he remember that they be but flesh ; a wind that passeth away , and cometh not again .
how oft do they provoke he in the wilderness , and grieve he in the desert !
yea , they turn back and tempt god , and limit the holy one of israel .
they remember not he hand , nor the day when he deliver they from the enemy .
how he have work he sign in egypt , and he wonder in the field of zoan :
and have turn they river into blood ; and they flood , that they could not drink .
he send diver sort of fly among they , which devour they ; and frog , which destroy they .
he give also they increase unto the caterpiller , and they labour unto the locust .
he destroy they vine with hail , and they sycomore tree with frost .
he give up they cattle also to the hail , and they flock to hot thunderbolt .
he cast upon they the fierceness of he anger , wrath , and indignation , and trouble , by send evil angel among they .
he make a way to he anger ; he spare not they soul from death , but give they life over to the pestilence ;
and smite all the firstborn in egypt ; the chief of they strength in the tabernacle of ham :
but make he own people to go forth like sheep , and guide they in the wilderness like a flock .
and he lead they on safely , so that they fear not : but the sea overwhelm they enemy .
and he bring they to the border of he sanctuary , even to this mountain , which he right hand have purchase .
he cast out the heathen also before they , and divide they a inheritance by line , and make the tribe of israel to dwell in they tent .
yet they tempt and provoke the most high god , and keep not he testimony :
but turn back , and deal unfaithfully like they father : they be turn aside like a deceitful bow .
for they provoke he to anger with they high place , and move he to jealousy with they graven image .
when god hear this , he be wroth , and greatly abhor israel :
so that he forsake the tabernacle of shiloh , the tent which he place among man ;
and deliver he strength into captivity , and he glory into the enemy 's hand .
he give he people over also unto the sword ; and be wroth with he inheritance .
the fire consume they young man ; and they maiden be not give to marriage .
they priest fall by the sword ; and they widow make no lamentation .
then the lord awake as one out of sleep , and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine .
and he smite he enemy in the hinder part : he put they to a perpetual reproach .
moreover he refuse the tabernacle of joseph , and choose not the tribe of ephraim :
but choose the tribe of judah , the mount zion which he love .
and he build he sanctuary like high palace , like the earth which he have establish for ever .
he choose david also he servant , and take he from the sheepfold :
from follow the ewe great with young he bring he to feed jacob he people , and israel he inheritance .
so he feed they accord to the integrity of he heart ; and guide they by the skilfulness of he hand .
o god , the heathen be come into thine inheritance ; thy holy temple have they defile ; they have lay jerusalem on heap .
the dead body of thy servant have they give to be meat unto the fowl of the heaven , the flesh of thy saint unto the beast of the earth .
they blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem ; and there be none to bury they .
we be become a reproach to we neighbour , a scorn and derision to they that be round about we .
how long , lord ? wilt thou be angry for ever ? shall thy jealousy burn like fire ?
pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not know thee , and upon the kingdom that have not call upon thy name .
for they have devour jacob , and lay waste he dwelling place .
o remember not against we former iniquity : let thy tender mercy speedily prevent we : for we be bring very low .
help we , o god of we salvation , for the glory of thy name : and deliver we , and purge away we sin , for thy name 's sake .
wherefore should the heathen say , where be they god ? let he be know among the heathen in we sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servant which be shed .
let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee ; accord to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that be appoint to die ;
and render unto we neighbour sevenfold into they bosom they reproach , wherewith they have reproach thee , o lord .
so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever : we will shew forth thy praise to all generation .
give ear , o shepherd of israel , thou that leadest joseph like a flock ; thou that dwellest between the cherubim , shine forth .
before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strength , and come and save we .
turn we again , o god , and cause thy face to shine ; and we shall be save .
o lord god of host , how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people ?
thou feedest they with the bread of tear ; and givest they tear to drink in great measure .
thou makest we a strife unto we neighbour : and we enemy laugh among themselves .
turn we again , o god of host , and cause thy face to shine ; and we shall be save .
thou hast bring a vine out of egypt : thou hast cast out the heathen , and plant it .
thou preparedst room before it , and didst cause it to take deep root , and it fill the land .
the hill be cover with the shadow of it , and the bough thereof be like the goodly cedar .
she send out she bough unto the sea , and she branch unto the river .
why hast thou then break down she hedge , so that all they which pass by the way do pluck she ?
the boar out of the wood doth waste it , and the wild beast of the field doth devour it .
return , we beseech thee , o god of host : look down from heaven , and behold , and visit this vine ;
and the vineyard which thy right hand have plant , and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself .
it be burn with fire , it be cut down : they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance .
let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand , upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself .
so will not we go back from thee : quicken we , and we will call upon thy name .
turn we again , o lord god of host , cause thy face to shine ; and we shall be save .
sing aloud unto god we strength : make a joyful noise unto the god of jacob .
take a psalm , and bring hither the timbrel , the pleasant harp with the psaltery .
blow up the trumpet in the new moon , in the time appoint , on we solemn feast day .
for this be a statute for israel , and a law of the god of jacob .
this he ordain in joseph for a testimony , when he go out through the land of egypt : where i hear a language that i understand not .
i remove he shoulder from the burden : he hand be deliver from the pot .
thou calledst in trouble , and i deliver thee ; i answer thee in the secret place of thunder : i prove thee at the water of meribah .
selah .
hear , o my people , and i will testify unto thee : o israel , if thou wilt hearken unto i ;
there shall no strange god be in thee ; neither shalt thou worship any strange god .
i be the lord thy god , which bring thee out of the land of egypt : open thy mouth wide , and i will fill it .
but my people would not hearken to my voice ; and israel would none of i .
so i give they up unto they own heart ' lust : and they walk in they own counsel .
oh that my people have hearken unto i , and israel have walk in my way !
i should soon have subdue they enemy , and turn my hand against they adversary .
the hater of the lord should have submit themselves unto he : but they time should have endure for ever .
he should have feed they also with the finest of the wheat : and with honey out of the rock should i have satisfy thee .
god standeth in the congregation of the mighty ; he judgeth among the god .
how long will ye judge unjustly , and accept the person of the wicked ?
selah .
defend the poor and fatherless : do justice to the afflict and needy .
deliver the poor and needy : rid they out of the hand of the wicked .
they know not , neither will they understand ; they walk on in darkness : all the foundation of the earth be out of course .
i have say , ye be god ; and all of you be child of the most high .
but ye shall die like man , and fall like one of the prince .
arise , o god , judge the earth : for thou shalt inherit all nation .
keep not thou silence , o god : hold not thy peace , and be not still , o god .
for , lo , thine enemy make a tumult : and they that hate thee have lift up the head .
they have take crafty counsel against thy people , and consult against thy hidden one .
they have say , come , and let we cut they off from be a nation ; that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance .
for they have consult together with one consent : they be confederate against thee :
the tabernacle of edom , and the ishmaelites ; of moab , and the hagarenes ;
gebal , and ammon , and amalek ; the philistines with the inhabitant of tyre ;
assur also be join with they : they have holpen the child of lot .
selah .
do unto they as unto the midianites ; as to sisera , as to jabin , at the brook of kison :
which perish at endor : they become as dung for the earth .
make they noble like oreb , and like zeeb : yea , all they prince as zebah , and as zalmunna :
who say , let we take to ourselves the house of god in possession .
o my god , make they like a wheel ; as the stubble before the wind .
as the fire burneth a wood , and as the flame setteth the mountain on fire ;
so persecute they with thy tempest , and make they afraid with thy storm .
fill they face with shame ; that they may seek thy name , o lord .
let they be confound and trouble for ever ; yea , let they be put to shame , and perish :
that man may know that thou , whose name alone be jehovah , art the most high over all the earth .
how amiable be thy tabernacle , o lord of host !
my soul longeth , yea , even fainteth for the court of the lord : my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living god .
yea , the sparrow have find a house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay she young , even thine altar , o lord of host , my king , and my god .
bless be they that dwell in thy house : they will be still praise thee .
selah .
bless be the man whose strength be in thee ; in whose heart be the way of they .
who pass through the valley of baca make it a well ; the rain also filleth the pool .
they go from strength to strength , every one of they in zion appeareth before god .
o lord god of host , hear my prayer : give ear , o god of jacob .
selah .
behold , o god we shield , and look upon the face of thine anointed .
for a day in thy court be better than a thousand .
i have rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my god , than to dwell in the tent of wickedness .
for the lord god be a sun and shield : the lord will give grace and glory : no good thing will he withhold from they that walk uprightly .
o lord of host , bless be the man that trusteth in thee .
lord , thou hast be favourable unto thy land : thou hast bring back the captivity of jacob .
thou hast forgive the iniquity of thy people , thou hast cover all they sin .
selah .
thou hast take away all thy wrath : thou hast turn thyself from the fierceness of thine anger .
turn we , o god of we salvation , and cause thine anger toward we to cease .
wilt thou be angry with we for ever ? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generation ?
wilt thou not revive we again : that thy people may rejoice in thee ?
shew we thy mercy , o lord , and grant we thy salvation .
i will hear what god the lord will speak : for he will speak peace unto he people , and to he saint : but let they not turn again to folly .
surely he salvation be nigh they that fear he ; that glory may dwell in we land .
mercy and truth be meet together ; righteousness and peace have kiss each other .
truth shall spring out of the earth ; and righteousness shall look down from heaven .
yea , the lord shall give that which be good ; and we land shall yield she increase .
righteousness shall go before he ; and shall set we in the way of he step .
bow down thine ear , o lord , hear i : for i be poor and needy .
preserve my soul ; for i be holy : o thou my god , save thy servant that trusteth in thee .
be merciful unto i , o lord : for i cry unto thee daily .
rejoice the soul of thy servant : for unto thee , o lord , do i lift up my soul .
for thou , lord , art good , and ready to forgive ; and plenteous in mercy unto all they that call upon thee .
give ear , o lord , unto my prayer ; and attend to the voice of my supplication .
in the day of my trouble i will call upon thee : for thou wilt answer i .
among the god there be none like unto thee , o lord ; neither be there any work like unto thy work .
all nation whom thou hast make shall come and worship before thee , o lord ; and shall glorify thy name .
for thou art great , and doest wondrous thing : thou art god alone .
teach i thy way , o lord ; i will walk in thy truth : unite my heart to fear thy name .
i will praise thee , o lord my god , with all my heart : and i will glorify thy name for evermore .
for great be thy mercy toward i : and thou hast deliver my soul from the lowest hell .
o god , the proud be rise against i , and the assembly of violent man have seek after my soul ; and have not set thee before they .
but thou , o lord , art a god full of compassion , and gracious , long suffering , and plenteous in mercy and truth .
o turn unto i , and have mercy upon i ; give thy strength unto thy servant , and save the son of thine handmaid .
shew i a token for good ; that they which hate i may see it , and be ashamed : because thou , lord , hast holpen i , and comfort i .
he foundation be in the holy mountain .
the lord loveth the gate of zion more than all the dwelling of jacob .
glorious thing be speak of thee , o city of god .
selah .
i will make mention of rahab and babylon to they that know i : behold philistia , and tyre , with ethiopia ; this man be bear there .
and of zion it shall be say , this and that man be bear in she : and the highest himself shall establish she .
the lord shall count , when he writeth up the people , that this man be bear there .
selah .
as well the singer as the player on instrument shall be there : all my spring be in thee .
o lord god of my salvation , i have cry day and night before thee :
let my prayer come before thee : incline thine ear unto my cry ;
for my soul be full of trouble : and my life draweth nigh unto the grave .
i be count with they that go down into the pit : i be as a man that have no strength :
free among the dead , like the slay that lie in the grave , whom thou rememberest no more : and they be cut off from thy hand .
thou hast lay i in the lowest pit , in darkness , in the deep .
thy wrath lieth hard upon i , and thou hast afflict i with all thy wave .
selah .
thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from i ; thou hast make i a abomination unto they : i be shut up , and i can not come forth .
mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction : lord , i have call daily upon thee , i have stretch out my hand unto thee .
wilt thou shew wonder to the dead ? shall the dead arise and praise thee ?
selah .
shall thy lovingkindness be declare in the grave ? or thy faithfulness in destruction ?
shall thy wonder be know in the dark ? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness ?
but unto thee have i cry , o lord ; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee .
lord , why castest thou off my soul ? why hidest thou thy face from i ?
i be afflict and ready to die from my youth up : while i suffer thy terror i be distract .
thy fierce wrath goeth over i ; thy terror have cut i off .
they come round about i daily like water ; they compass i about together .
lover and friend hast thou put far from i , and mine acquaintance into darkness .
i will sing of the mercy of the lord for ever : with my mouth will i make known thy faithfulness to all generation .
for i have say , mercy shall be build up for ever : thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heaven .
i have make a covenant with my choose , i have swear unto david my servant ,
thy seed will i establish for ever , and build up thy throne to all generation .
selah .
and the heaven shall praise thy wonder , o lord : thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saint .
for who in the heaven can be compare unto the lord ? who among the son of the mighty can be liken unto the lord ?
god be greatly to be fear in the assembly of the saint , and to be have in reverence of all they that be about he .
o lord god of host , who be a strong lord like unto thee ? or to thy faithfulness round about thee ?
thou rulest the rage of the sea : when the wave thereof arise , thou stillest they .
thou hast broken rahab in piece , as one that be slay ; thou hast scatter thine enemy with thy strong arm .
the heaven be thine , the earth also be thine : as for the world and the fulness thereof , thou hast found they .
the north and the south thou hast create they : tabor and hermon shall rejoice in thy name .
thou hast a mighty arm : strong be thy hand , and high be thy right hand .
justice and judgment be the habitation of thy throne : mercy and truth shall go before thy face .
bless be the people that know the joyful sound : they shall walk , o lord , in the light of thy countenance .
in thy name shall they rejoice all the day : and in thy righteousness shall they be exalt .
for thou art the glory of they strength : and in thy favour we horn shall be exalt .
for the lord be we defence ; and the holy one of israel be we king .
then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one , and saidst , i have lay help upon one that be mighty ; i have exalt one choose out of the people .
i have find david my servant ; with my holy oil have i anoint he :
with whom my hand shall be establish : mine arm also shall strengthen he .
the enemy shall not exact upon he ; nor the son of wickedness afflict he .
and i will beat down he foe before he face , and plague they that hate he .
but my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with he : and in my name shall he horn be exalt .
i will set he hand also in the sea , and he right hand in the river .
he shall cry unto i , thou art my father , my god , and the rock of my salvation .
also i will make he my firstborn , higher than the king of the earth .
my mercy will i keep for he for evermore , and my covenant shall stand fast with he .
he seed also will i make to endure for ever , and he throne as the day of heaven .
if he child forsake my law , and walk not in my judgment ;
if they break my statute , and keep not my commandment ;
then will i visit they transgression with the rod , and they iniquity with stripe .
nevertheless my lovingkindness will i not utterly take from he , nor suffer my faithfulness to fail .
my covenant will i not break , nor alter the thing that be go out of my lip .
once have i swear by my holiness that i will not lie unto david .
he seed shall endure for ever , and he throne as the sun before i .
it shall be establish for ever as the moon , and as a faithful witness in heaven .
selah .
but thou hast cast off and abhor , thou hast be wroth with thine anointed .
thou hast make void the covenant of thy servant : thou hast profane he crown by cast it to the ground .
thou hast break down all he hedge ; thou hast bring he strong hold to ruin .
all that pass by the way spoil he : he be a reproach to he neighbour .
thou hast set up the right hand of he adversary ; thou hast make all he enemy to rejoice .
thou hast also turn the edge of he sword , and hast not make he to stand in the battle .
thou hast make he glory to cease , and cast he throne down to the ground .
the day of he youth hast thou shorten : thou hast cover he with shame .
selah .
how long , lord ? wilt thou hide thyself for ever ? shall thy wrath burn like fire ?
remember how short my time be : wherefore hast thou make all man in vain ?
what man be he that liveth , and shall not see death ? shall he deliver he soul from the hand of the grave ?
selah .
lord , where be thy former lovingkindness , which thou swarest unto david in thy truth ?
remember , lord , the reproach of thy servant ; how i do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people ;
wherewith thine enemy have reproach , o lord ; wherewith they have reproach the footstep of thine anointed .
bless be the lord for evermore .
amen , and amen .
lord , thou hast be we dwelling place in all generation .
before the mountain be bring forth , or ever thou hadst form the earth and the world , even from everlasting to everlasting , thou art god .
thou turnest man to destruction ; and sayest , return , ye child of man .
for a thousand year in thy sight be but as yesterday when it be past , and as a watch in the night .
thou carriest they away as with a flood ; they be as a sleep : in the morning they be like grass which groweth up .
in the morning it flourisheth , and groweth up ; in the evening it be cut down , and withereth .
for we be consume by thine anger , and by thy wrath be we trouble .
thou hast set we iniquity before thee , we secret sin in the light of thy countenance .
for all we day be pass away in thy wrath : we spend we year as a tale that be tell .
the day of we year be threescore year and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore year , yet be they strength labour and sorrow ; for it be soon cut off , and we fly away .
who knoweth the power of thine anger ? even accord to thy fear , so be thy wrath .
so teach we to number we day , that we may apply we heart unto wisdom .
return , o lord , how long ? and let it repent thee concern thy servant .
o satisfy we early with thy mercy ; that we may rejoice and be glad all we day .
make we glad accord to the day wherein thou hast afflict we , and the year wherein we have see evil .
let thy work appear unto thy servant , and thy glory unto they child .
and let the beauty of the lord we god be upon we : and establish thou the work of we hand upon we ; yea , the work of we hand establish thou it .
he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty .
i will say of the lord , he be my refuge and my fortress : my god ; in he will i trust .
surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler , and from the noisome pestilence .
he shall cover thee with he feather , and under he wing shalt thou trust : he truth shall be thy shield and buckler .
thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night ; nor for the arrow that flieth by day ;
nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness ; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday .
a thousand shall fall at thy side , and ten thousand at thy right hand ; but it shall not come nigh thee .
only with thine eye shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked .
because thou hast make the lord , which be my refuge , even the most high , thy habitation ;
there shall no evil befall thee , neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling .
for he shall give he angel charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy way .
they shall bear thee up in they hand , lest thou dash thy foot against a stone .
thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder : the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot .
because he have set he love upon i , therefore will i deliver he : i will set he on high , because he have known my name .
he shall call upon i , and i will answer he : i will be with he in trouble ; i will deliver he , and honour he .
with long life will i satisfy he , and shew he my salvation .
it be a good thing to give thanks unto the lord , and to sing praise unto thy name , o most high :
to shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning , and thy faithfulness every night ,
upon a instrument of ten string , and upon the psaltery ; upon the harp with a solemn sound .
for thou , lord , hast make i glad through thy work : i will triumph in the work of thy hand .
o lord , how great be thy work ! and thy thought be very deep .
a brutish man knoweth not ; neither doth a fool understand this .
when the wicked spring as the grass , and when all the worker of iniquity do flourish ; it be that they shall be destroy for ever :
but thou , lord , art most high for evermore .
for , lo , thine enemy , o lord , for , lo , thine enemy shall perish ; all the worker of iniquity shall be scatter .
but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of a unicorn : i shall be anoint with fresh oil .
mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemy , and mine ear shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against i .
the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree : he shall grow like a cedar in lebanon .
those that be plant in the house of the lord shall flourish in the court of we god .
they shall still bring forth fruit in old age ; they shall be fat and flourish ;
to shew that the lord be upright : he be my rock , and there be no unrighteousness in he .
the lord reigneth , he be clothe with majesty ; the lord be clothe with strength , wherewith he have gird himself : the world also be stablish , that it can not be move .
thy throne be establish of old : thou art from everlasting .
the flood have lift up , o lord , the flood have lift up they voice ; the flood lift up they wave .
the lord on high be mightier than the noise of many water , yea , than the mighty wave of the sea .
thy testimony be very sure : holiness becometh thine house , o lord , for ever .
o lord god , to whom vengeance belongeth ; o god , to whom vengeance belongeth , shew thyself .
lift up thyself , thou judge of the earth : render a reward to the proud .
lord , how long shall the wicked , how long shall the wicked triumph ?
how long shall they utter and speak hard thing ? and all the worker of iniquity boast themselves ?
they break in piece thy people , o lord , and afflict thine heritage .
they slay the widow and the stranger , and murder the fatherless .
yet they say , the lord shall not see , neither shall the god of jacob regard it .
understand , ye brutish among the people : and ye fool , when will ye be wise ?
he that plant the ear , shall he not hear ? he that form the eye , shall he not see ?
he that chastiseth the heathen , shall not he correct ? he that teacheth man knowledge , shall not he know ?
the lord knoweth the thought of man , that they be vanity .
bless be the man whom thou chastenest , o lord , and teachest he out of thy law ;
that thou mayest give he rest from the day of adversity , until the pit be dig for the wicked .
for the lord will not cast off he people , neither will he forsake he inheritance .
but judgment shall return unto righteousness : and all the upright in heart shall follow it .
who will rise up for i against the evildoer ? or who will stand up for i against the worker of iniquity ?
unless the lord have be my help , my soul have almost dwell in silence .
when i say , my foot slippeth ; thy mercy , o lord , hold i up .
in the multitude of my thought within i thy comfort delight my soul .
shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee , which frameth mischief by a law ?
they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous , and condemn the innocent blood .
but the lord be my defence ; and my god be the rock of my refuge .
and he shall bring upon they they own iniquity , and shall cut they off in they own wickedness ; yea , the lord we god shall cut they off .
o come , let we sing unto the lord : let we make a joyful noise to the rock of we salvation .
let we come before he presence with thanksgiving , and make a joyful noise unto he with psalm .
for the lord be a great god , and a great king above all god .
in he hand be the deep place of the earth : the strength of the hill be he also .
the sea be he , and he make it : and he hand form the dry land .
o come , let we worship and bow down : let we kneel before the lord we maker .
for he be we god ; and we be the people of he pasture , and the sheep of he hand .
to day if ye will hear he voice ,
harden not you heart , as in the provocation , and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness :
when you father tempt i , prove i , and see my work .
forty year long be i grieve with this generation , and say , it be a people that do err in they heart , and they have not know my way :
unto whom i sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest .
o sing unto the lord a new song : sing unto the lord , all the earth .
sing unto the lord , bless he name ; shew forth he salvation from day to day .
declare he glory among the heathen , he wonder among all people .
for the lord be great , and greatly to be praise : he be to be fear above all god .
for all the god of the nation be idol : but the lord make the heaven .
honour and majesty be before he : strength and beauty be in he sanctuary .
give unto the lord , o ye kindred of the people , give unto the lord glory and strength .
give unto the lord the glory due unto he name : bring a offering , and come into he court .
o worship the lord in the beauty of holiness : fear before he , all the earth .
say among the heathen that the lord reigneth : the world also shall be establish that it shall not be move : he shall judge the people righteously .
let the heaven rejoice , and let the earth be glad ; let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof .
let the field be joyful , and all that be therein : then shall all the tree of the wood rejoice
before the lord : for he cometh , for he cometh to judge the earth : he shall judge the world with righteousness , and the people with he truth .
the lord reigneth ; let the earth rejoice ; let the multitude of isle be glad thereof .
cloud and darkness be round about he : righteousness and judgment be the habitation of he throne .
a fire goeth before he , and burneth up he enemy round about .
he lightning enlighten the world : the earth saw , and tremble .
the hill melt like wax at the presence of the lord , at the presence of the lord of the whole earth .
the heaven declare he righteousness , and all the people see he glory .
confound be all they that serve graven image , that boast themselves of idol : worship he , all ye god .
zion hear , and be glad ; and the daughter of judah rejoice because of thy judgment , o lord .
for thou , lord , art high above all the earth : thou art exalt far above all god .
ye that love the lord , hate evil : he preserveth the soul of he saint ; he delivereth they out of the hand of the wicked .
light be sow for the righteous , and gladness for the upright in heart .
rejoice in the lord , ye righteous ; and give thanks at the remembrance of he holiness .
o sing unto the lord a new song ; for he have do marvellous thing : he right hand , and he holy arm , have get he the victory .
the lord have make know he salvation : he righteousness have he openly shew in the sight of the heathen .
he have remember he mercy and he truth toward the house of israel : all the end of the earth have see the salvation of we god .
make a joyful noise unto the lord , all the earth : make a loud noise , and rejoice , and sing praise .
sing unto the lord with the harp ; with the harp , and the voice of a psalm .
with trumpet and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the lord , the king .
let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein .
let the flood clap they hand : let the hill be joyful together
before the lord ; for he cometh to judge the earth : with righteousness shall he judge the world , and the people with equity .
the lord reigneth ; let the people tremble : he sitteth between the cherubim ; let the earth be move .
the lord be great in zion ; and he be high above all the people .
let they praise thy great and terrible name ; for it be holy .
the king 's strength also loveth judgment ; thou dost establish equity , thou executest judgment and righteousness in jacob .
exalt ye the lord we god , and worship at he footstool ; for he be holy .
mose and aaron among he priest , and samuel among they that call upon he name ; they call upon the lord , and he answer they .
he speak unto they in the cloudy pillar : they keep he testimony , and the ordinance that he give they .
thou answeredst they , o lord we god : thou wast a god that forgavest they , though thou tookest vengeance of they invention .
exalt the lord we god , and worship at he holy hill ; for the lord we god be holy .
make a joyful noise unto the lord , all ye land .
serve the lord with gladness : come before he presence with singing .
know ye that the lord he be god : it be he that have make we , and not we ourselves ; we be he people , and the sheep of he pasture .
enter into he gate with thanksgiving , and into he court with praise : be thankful unto he , and bless he name .
for the lord be good ; he mercy be everlasting ; and he truth endureth to all generation .
i will sing of mercy and judgment : unto thee , o lord , will i sing .
i will behave myself wisely in a perfect way .
o when wilt thou come unto i ?
i will walk within my house with a perfect heart .
i will set no wicked thing before mine eye : i hate the work of they that turn aside ; it shall not cleave to i .
a froward heart shall depart from i : i will not know a wicked person .
whoso privily slandereth he neighbour , he will i cut off : he that have a high look and a proud heart will not i suffer .
mine eye shall be upon the faithful of the land , that they may dwell with i : he that walketh in a perfect way , he shall serve i .
he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house : he that telleth lie shall not tarry in my sight .
i will early destroy all the wicked of the land ; that i may cut off all wicked doer from the city of the lord .
hear my prayer , o lord , and let my cry come unto thee .
hide not thy face from i in the day when i be in trouble ; incline thine ear unto i : in the day when i call answer i speedily .
for my day be consume like smoke , and my bone be burn as a hearth .
my heart be smitten , and wither like grass ; so that i forget to eat my bread .
by reason of the voice of my groan my bone cleave to my skin .
i be like a pelican of the wilderness : i be like a owl of the desert .
i watch , and be as a sparrow alone upon the house top .
mine enemy reproach i all the day ; and they that be mad against i be swear against i .
for i have eat ash like bread , and mingle my drink with weep ,
because of thine indignation and thy wrath : for thou hast lift i up , and cast i down .
my day be like a shadow that declineth ; and i be wither like grass .
but thou , o lord , shalt endure for ever ; and thy remembrance unto all generation .
thou shalt arise , and have mercy upon zion : for the time to favour she , yea , the set time , be come .
for thy servant take pleasure in she stone , and favour the dust thereof .
so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord , and all the king of the earth thy glory .
when the lord shall build up zion , he shall appear in he glory .
he will regard the prayer of the destitute , and not despise they prayer .
this shall be write for the generation to come : and the people which shall be create shall praise the lord .
for he have look down from the height of he sanctuary ; from heaven do the lord behold the earth ;
to hear the groaning of the prisoner ; to loose those that be appoint to death ;
to declare the name of the lord in zion , and he praise in jerusalem ;
when the people be gather together , and the kingdom , to serve the lord .
he weaken my strength in the way ; he shorten my day .
i say , o my god , take i not away in the midst of my day : thy year be throughout all generation .
of old hast thou lay the foundation of the earth : and the heaven be the work of thy hand .
they shall perish , but thou shalt endure : yea , all of they shall wax old like a garment ; as a vesture shalt thou change they , and they shall be change :
but thou art the same , and thy year shall have no end .
the child of thy servant shall continue , and they seed shall be establish before thee .
bless the lord , o my soul : and all that be within i , bless he holy name .
bless the lord , o my soul , and forget not all he benefit :
who forgiveth all thine iniquity ; who healeth all thy disease ;
who redeemeth thy life from destruction ; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercy ;
who satisfieth thy mouth with good thing ; so that thy youth be renew like the eagle 's .
the lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that be oppress .
he make know he way unto mose , he act unto the child of israel .
the lord be merciful and gracious , slow to anger , and plenteous in mercy .
he will not always chide : neither will he keep he anger for ever .
he have not deal with we after we sin ; nor reward we accord to we iniquity .
for as the heaven be high above the earth , so great be he mercy toward they that fear he .
as far as the east be from the west , so far have he remove we transgression from we .
like as a father pitieth he child , so the lord pitieth they that fear he .
for he knoweth we frame ; he remembereth that we be dust .
as for man , he day be as grass : as a flower of the field , so he flourisheth .
for the wind passeth over it , and it be go ; and the place thereof shall know it no more .
but the mercy of the lord be from everlasting to everlasting upon they that fear he , and he righteousness unto child 's child ;
to such as keep he covenant , and to those that remember he commandment to do they .
the lord have prepared he throne in the heaven ; and he kingdom ruleth over all .
bless the lord , ye he angel , that excel in strength , that do he commandment , hearken unto the voice of he word .
bless ye the lord , all ye he host ; ye minister of he , that do he pleasure .
bless the lord , all he work in all place of he dominion : bless the lord , o my soul .
bless the lord , o my soul .
o lord my god , thou art very great ; thou art clothe with honour and majesty .
who coverest thyself with light as with a garment : who stretchest out the heaven like a curtain :
who layeth the beam of he chamber in the water : who maketh the cloud he chariot : who walketh upon the wing of the wind :
who maketh he angel spirit ; he minister a flaming fire :
who lay the foundation of the earth , that it should not be remove for ever .
thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment : the water stand above the mountain .
at thy rebuke they flee ; at the voice of thy thunder they hast away .
they go up by the mountain ; they go down by the valley unto the place which thou hast found for they .
thou hast set a bind that they may not pass over ; that they turn not again to cover the earth .
he sendeth the spring into the valley , which run among the hill .
they give drink to every beast of the field : the wild ass quench they thirst .
by they shall the fowl of the heaven have they habitation , which sing among the branch .
he watereth the hill from he chamber : the earth be satisfy with the fruit of thy work .
he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle , and herb for the service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the earth ;
and wine that maketh glad the heart of man , and oil to make he face to shine , and bread which strengtheneth man 's heart .
the tree of the lord be full of sap ; the cedar of lebanon , which he have plant ;
where the bird make they nest : as for the stork , the fir tree be she house .
the high hill be a refuge for the wild goat ; and the rock for the cony .
he appoint the moon for season : the sun knoweth he go down .
thou makest darkness , and it be night : wherein all the beast of the forest do creep forth .
the young lion roar after they prey , and seek they meat from god .
the sun ariseth , they gather themselves together , and lay they down in they den .
man goeth forth unto he work and to he labour until the evening .
o lord , how manifold be thy work ! in wisdom hast thou make they all : the earth be full of thy riches .
so be this great and wide sea , wherein be thing creep innumerable , both small and great beast .
there go the ship : there be that leviathan , whom thou hast make to play therein .
these wait all upon thee ; that thou mayest give they they meat in due season .
that thou givest they they gather : thou openest thine hand , they be fill with good .
thou hidest thy face , they be trouble : thou takest away they breath , they die , and return to they dust .
thou sendest forth thy spirit , they be create : and thou renewest the face of the earth .
the glory of the lord shall endure for ever : the lord shall rejoice in he work .
he looketh on the earth , and it trembleth : he toucheth the hill , and they smoke .
i will sing unto the lord as long as i live : i will sing praise to my god while i have my being .
my meditation of he shall be sweet : i will be glad in the lord .
let the sinner be consume out of the earth , and let the wicked be no more .
bless thou the lord , o my soul .
praise ye the lord .
o give thanks unto the lord ; call upon he name : make know he deed among the people .
sing unto he , sing psalm unto he : talk ye of all he wondrous work .
glory ye in he holy name : let the heart of they rejoice that seek the lord .
seek the lord , and he strength : seek he face evermore .
remember he marvellous work that he have do ; he wonder , and the judgment of he mouth ;
o ye seed of abraham he servant , ye child of jacob he choose .
he be the lord we god : he judgment be in all the earth .
he have remember he covenant for ever , the word which he command to a thousand generation .
which covenant he make with abraham , and he oath unto isaac ;
and confirm the same unto jacob for a law , and to israel for a everlasting covenant :
say , unto thee will i give the land of canaan , the lot of you inheritance :
when they be but a few man in number ; yea , very few , and stranger in it .
when they go from one nation to another , from one kingdom to another people ;
he suffer no man to do they wrong : yea , he reprove king for they sake ;
say , touch not mine anointed , and do my prophet no harm .
moreover he call for a famine upon the land : he brake the whole staff of bread .
he send a man before they , even joseph , who be sell for a servant :
whose foot they hurt with fetter : he be lay in iron :
until the time that he word come : the word of the lord try he .
the king send and loose he ; even the ruler of the people , and let he go free .
he make he lord of he house , and ruler of all he substance :
to bind he prince at he pleasure ; and teach he senator wisdom .
israel also come into egypt ; and jacob sojourn in the land of ham .
and he increase he people greatly ; and make they stronger than they enemy .
he turn they heart to hate he people , to deal subtilly with he servant .
he send mose he servant ; and aaron whom he have choose .
they shew he sign among they , and wonder in the land of ham .
he send darkness , and make it dark ; and they rebel not against he word .
he turn they water into blood , and slew they fish .
they land bring forth frog in abundance , in the chamber of they king .
he speak , and there come diver sort of fly , and louse in all they coast .
he give they hail for rain , and flaming fire in they land .
he smite they vine also and they fig tree ; and brake the tree of they coast .
he speak , and the locust come , and caterpiller , and that without number ,
and do eat up all the herb in they land , and devour the fruit of they ground .
he smite also all the firstborn in they land , the chief of all they strength .
he bring they forth also with silver and gold : and there be not one feeble person among they tribe .
egypt be glad when they depart : for the fear of they fall upon they .
he spread a cloud for a cover ; and fire to give light in the night .
the people ask , and he bring quail , and satisfy they with the bread of heaven .
he open the rock , and the water gush out ; they run in the dry place like a river .
for he remember he holy promise , and abraham he servant .
and he bring forth he people with joy , and he choose with gladness :
and give they the land of the heathen : and they inherit the labour of the people ;
that they might observe he statute , and keep he law .
praise ye the lord .
praise ye the lord .
o give thanks unto the lord ; for he be good : for he mercy endureth for ever .
who can utter the mighty act of the lord ? who can shew forth all he praise ?
bless be they that keep judgment , and he that doeth righteousness at all time .
remember i , o lord , with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people : o visit i with thy salvation ;
that i may see the good of thy choose , that i may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation , that i may glory with thine inheritance .
we have sin with we father , we have commit iniquity , we have do wickedly .
we father understand not thy wonder in egypt ; they remember not the multitude of thy mercy ; but provoke he at the sea , even at the red sea .
nevertheless he save they for he name 's sake , that he might make he mighty power to be know .
he rebuke the red sea also , and it be dry up : so he lead they through the depths , as through the wilderness .
and he save they from the hand of he that hate they , and redeem they from the hand of the enemy .
and the water cover they enemy : there be not one of they leave .
then believe they he word ; they sing he praise .
they soon forgat he work ; they wait not for he counsel :
but lust exceedingly in the wilderness , and tempt god in the desert .
and he give they they request ; but send leanness into they soul .
they envy moses also in the camp , and aaron the saint of the lord .
the earth open and swallow up dathan , and cover the company of abiram .
and a fire be kindle in they company ; the flame burn up the wicked .
they make a calf in horeb , and worship the molten image .
thus they change they glory into the similitude of a ox that eateth grass .
they forgat god they saviour , which have do great thing in egypt ;
wondrous work in the land of ham , and terrible thing by the red sea .
therefore he say that he would destroy they , have not mose he chosen stand before he in the breach , to turn away he wrath , lest he should destroy they .
yea , they despise the pleasant land , they believe not he word :
but murmur in they tent , and hearken not unto the voice of the lord .
therefore he lift up he hand against they , to overthrow they in the wilderness :
to overthrow they seed also among the nation , and to scatter they in the land .
they join themselves also unto baalpeor , and eat the sacrifice of the dead .
thus they provoke he to anger with they invention : and the plague brake in upon they .
then stand up phinehas , and execute judgment : and so the plague be stay .
and that be count unto he for righteousness unto all generation for evermore .
they anger he also at the water of strife , so that it go ill with mose for they sake :
because they provoke he spirit , so that he speak unadvisedly with he lip .
they do not destroy the nation , concern whom the lord command they :
but be mingle among the heathen , and learn they work .
and they serve they idol : which be a snare unto they .
yea , they sacrifice they son and they daughter unto devil ,
and shed innocent blood , even the blood of they son and of they daughter , whom they sacrifice unto the idol of canaan : and the land be polluted with blood .
thus be they defile with they own work , and go a whoring with they own invention .
therefore be the wrath of the lord kindle against he people , insomuch that he abhor he own inheritance .
and he give they into the hand of the heathen ; and they that hate they rule over they .
they enemy also oppress they , and they be bring into subjection under they hand .
many time do he deliver they ; but they provoke he with they counsel , and be bring low for they iniquity .
nevertheless he regard they affliction , when he hear they cry :
and he remember for they he covenant , and repent accord to the multitude of he mercy .
he make they also to be pity of all those that carry they captive .
save we , o lord we god , and gather we from among the heathen , to give thanks unto thy holy name , and to triumph in thy praise .
bless be the lord god of israel from everlasting to everlasting : and let all the people say , amen .
praise ye the lord .
o give thanks unto the lord , for he be good : for he mercy endureth for ever .
let the redeem of the lord say so , whom he have redeem from the hand of the enemy ;
and gather they out of the land , from the east , and from the west , from the north , and from the south .
they wander in the wilderness in a solitary way ; they find no city to dwell in .
hungry and thirsty , they soul faint in they .
then they cry unto the lord in they trouble , and he deliver they out of they distress .
and he lead they forth by the right way , that they might go to a city of habitation .
oh that man would praise the lord for he goodness , and for he wonderful work to the child of man !
for he satisfieth the longing soul , and filleth the hungry soul with goodness .
such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , be bind in affliction and iron ;
because they rebel against the word of god , and contemn the counsel of the most high :
therefore he bring down they heart with labour ; they fall down , and there be none to help .
then they cry unto the lord in they trouble , and he save they out of they distress .
he bring they out of darkness and the shadow of death , and brake they band in sunder .
oh that man would praise the lord for he goodness , and for he wonderful work to the child of man !
for he have break the gate of brass , and cut the bar of iron in sunder .
fool because of they transgression , and because of they iniquity , be afflict .
they soul abhorreth all manner of meat ; and they draw near unto the gate of death .
then they cry unto the lord in they trouble , and he saveth they out of they distress .
he send he word , and heal they , and deliver they from they destruction .
oh that man would praise the lord for he goodness , and for he wonderful work to the child of man !
and let they sacrifice the sacrifice of thanksgiving , and declare he work with rejoice .
they that go down to the sea in ship , that do business in great water ;
these see the work of the lord , and he wonder in the deep .
for he commandeth , and raiseth the stormy wind , which lifteth up the wave thereof .
they mount up to the heaven , they go down again to the depths : they soul be melt because of trouble .
they reel to and fro , and stagger like a drunken man , and be at they wit 's end .
then they cry unto the lord in they trouble , and he bringeth they out of they distress .
he maketh the storm a calm , so that the wave thereof be still .
then be they glad because they be quiet ; so he bringeth they unto they desire haven .
oh that man would praise the lord for he goodness , and for he wonderful work to the child of man !
let they exalt he also in the congregation of the people , and praise he in the assembly of the elder .
he turneth river into a wilderness , and the waterspring into dry ground ;
a fruitful land into barrenness , for the wickedness of they that dwell therein .
he turneth the wilderness into a standing water , and dry ground into waterspring .
and there he maketh the hungry to dwell , that they may prepare a city for habitation ;
and sow the field , and plant vineyard , which may yield fruit of increase .
he blesseth they also , so that they be multiply greatly ; and suffereth not they cattle to decrease .
again , they be minish and bring low through oppression , affliction , and sorrow .
he poureth contempt upon prince , and causeth they to wander in the wilderness , where there be no way .
yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction , and maketh he family like a flock .
the righteous shall see it , and rejoice : and all iniquity shall stop she mouth .
whoso be wise , and will observe these thing , even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the lord .
o god , my heart be fix ; i will sing and give praise , even with my glory .
awake , psaltery and harp : i myself will awake early .
i will praise thee , o lord , among the people : and i will sing praise unto thee among the nation .
for thy mercy be great above the heaven : and thy truth reacheth unto the cloud .
be thou exalted , o god , above the heaven : and thy glory above all the earth ;
that thy beloved may be deliver : save with thy right hand , and answer i .
god have speak in he holiness ; i will rejoice , i will divide shechem , and mete out the valley of succoth .
gilead be mine ; manasseh be mine ; ephraim also be the strength of mine head ; judah be my lawgiver ;
moab be my washpot ; over edom will i cast out my shoe ; over philistia will i triumph .
who will bring i into the strong city ? who will lead i into edom ?
wilt not thou , o god , who hast cast we off ? and wilt not thou , o god , go forth with we host ?
give we help from trouble : for vain be the help of man .
through god we shall do valiantly : for he it be that shall tread down we enemy .
hold not thy peace , o god of my praise ;
for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful be open against i : they have speak against i with a lie tongue .
they compass i about also with word of hatred ; and fight against i without a cause .
for my love they be my adversary : but i give myself unto prayer .
and they have reward i evil for good , and hatred for my love .
set thou a wicked man over he : and let satan stand at he right hand .
when he shall be judge , let he be condemn : and let he prayer become sin .
let he day be few ; and let another take he office .
let he child be fatherless , and he wife a widow .
let he child be continually vagabond , and beg : let they seek they bread also out of they desolate place .
let the extortioner catch all that he have ; and let the stranger spoil he labour .
let there be none to extend mercy unto he : neither let there be any to favour he fatherless child .
let he posterity be cut off ; and in the generation follow let they name be blot out .
let the iniquity of he father be remember with the lord ; and let not the sin of he mother be blot out .
let they be before the lord continually , that he may cut off the memory of they from the earth .
because that he remember not to shew mercy , but persecute the poor and needy man , that he might even slay the break in heart .
as he love cursing , so let it come unto he : as he delight not in blessing , so let it be far from he .
as he clothe himself with cursing like as with he garment , so let it come into he bowels like water , and like oil into he bone .
let it be unto he as the garment which covereth he , and for a girdle wherewith he be gird continually .
let this be the reward of mine adversary from the lord , and of they that speak evil against my soul .
but do thou for i , o god the lord , for thy name 's sake : because thy mercy be good , deliver thou i .
for i be poor and needy , and my heart be wound within i .
i be go like the shadow when it declineth : i be toss up and down as the locust .
my knee be weak through fasting ; and my flesh faileth of fatness .
i become also a reproach unto they : when they look upon i they shake they head .
help i , o lord my god : o save i accord to thy mercy :
that they may know that this be thy hand ; that thou , lord , hast do it .
let they curse , but bless thou : when they arise , let they be ashamed ; but let thy servant rejoice .
let mine adversary be clothe with shame , and let they cover themselves with they own confusion , as with a mantle .
i will greatly praise the lord with my mouth ; yea , i will praise he among the multitude .
for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor , to save he from those that condemn he soul .
the lord say unto my lord , sit thou at my right hand , until i make thine enemy thy footstool .
the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion : rule thou in the midst of thine enemy .
thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power , in the beauty of holiness from the womb of the morning : thou hast the dew of thy youth .
the lord have swear , and will not repent , thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek .
the lord at thy right hand shall strike through king in the day of he wrath .
he shall judge among the heathen , he shall fill the place with the dead body ; he shall wind the head over many country .
he shall drink of the brook in the way : therefore shall he lift up the head .
praise ye the lord .

woe be i , that i sojourn in mesech , that i dwell in the tent of kedar !
my soul have long dwell with he that hateth peace .
i be for peace : but when i speak , they be for war .
i will lift up mine eye unto the hill , from whence cometh my help .
my help cometh from the lord , which make heaven and earth .
he will not suffer thy foot to be move : he that keepeth thee will not slumber .
behold , he that keepeth israel shall neither slumber nor sleep .
the lord be thy keeper : the lord be thy shade upon thy right hand .
the sun shall not smite thee by day , nor the moon by night .
the lord shall preserve thee from all evil : he shall preserve thy soul .
the lord shall preserve thy go out and thy come in from this time forth , and even for evermore .
i be glad when they say unto i , let we go into the house of the lord .
we foot shall stand within thy gate , o jerusalem .
jerusalem be build as a city that be compact together :
whither the tribe go up , the tribe of the lord , unto the testimony of israel , to give thanks unto the name of the lord .
for there be set throne of judgment , the throne of the house of david .
pray for the peace of jerusalem : they shall prosper that love thee .
peace be within thy wall , and prosperity within thy palace .
for my brethren and companion ' sake , i will now say , peace be within thee .
because of the house of the lord we god i will seek thy good .
unto thee lift i up mine eye , o thou that dwellest in the heaven .
behold , as the eye of servant look unto the hand of they master , and as the eye of a maiden unto the hand of she mistress ; so we eye wait upon the lord we god , until that he have mercy upon we .
have mercy upon we , o lord , have mercy upon we : for we be exceedingly fill with contempt .
we soul be exceedingly fill with the scorning of those that be at ease , and with the contempt of the proud .
if it have not be the lord who be on we side , now may israel say ;
if it have not be the lord who be on we side , when man rise up against we :
then they have swallow we up quick , when they wrath be kindle against we :
then the water have overwhelm we , the stream have go over we soul :
then the proud water have go over we soul .
bless be the lord , who have not give we as a prey to they tooth .
we soul be escape as a bird out of the snare of the fowler : the snare be break , and we be escape .
we help be in the name of the lord , who make heaven and earth .
they that trust in the lord shall be as mount zion , which can not be remove , but abideth for ever .
as the mountain be round about jerusalem , so the lord be round about he people from henceforth even for ever .
for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous ; lest the righteous put forth they hand unto iniquity .
do good , o lord , unto those that be good , and to they that be upright in they heart .
as for such as turn aside unto they crooked way , the lord shall lead they forth with the worker of iniquity : but peace shall be upon israel .
when the lord turn again the captivity of zion , we be like they that dream .
then be we mouth fill with laughter , and we tongue with singing : then say they among the heathen , the lord have do great thing for they .
the lord have do great thing for we ; whereof we be glad .
turn again we captivity , o lord , as the stream in the south .
they that sow in tear shall reap in joy .
he that goeth forth and weepeth , bear precious seed , shall doubtless come again with rejoicing , bring he sheaf with he .
except the lord build the house , they labour in vain that build it : except the lord keep the city , the watchman waketh but in vain .
it be vain for you to rise up early , to sit up late , to eat the bread of sorrow : for so he giveth he beloved sleep .
lo , child be a heritage of the lord : and the fruit of the womb be he reward .
as arrow be in the hand of a mighty man ; so be child of the youth .
happy be the man that have he quiver full of they : they shall not be ashamed , but they shall speak with the enemy in the gate .
bless be every one that feareth the lord ; that walketh in he way .
for thou shalt eat the labour of thine hand : happy shalt thou be , and it shall be well with thee .
thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the side of thine house : thy child like olive plant round about thy table .
behold , that thus shall the man be bless that feareth the lord .
the lord shall bless thee out of zion : and thou shalt see the good of jerusalem all the day of thy life .
yea , thou shalt see thy child 's child , and peace upon israel .
many a time have they afflict i from my youth , may israel now say :
many a time have they afflict i from my youth : yet they have not prevail against i .
the plower plow upon my back : they make long they furrow .
the lord be righteous : he have cut asunder the cord of the wicked .
let they all be confound and turn back that hate zion .
let they be as the grass upon the housetops , which withereth afore it groweth up :
wherewith the mower filleth not he hand ; nor he that bindeth sheave he bosom .
neither do they which go by say , the blessing of the lord be upon you : we bless you in the name of the lord .
out of the depths have i cry unto thee , o lord .
lord , hear my voice : let thine ear be attentive to the voice of my supplication .
if thou , lord , shouldest mark iniquity , o lord , who shall stand ?
but there be forgiveness with thee , that thou mayest be fear .
i wait for the lord , my soul doth wait , and in he word do i hope .
my soul waiteth for the lord more than they that watch for the morning : i say , more than they that watch for the morning .
let israel hope in the lord : for with the lord there be mercy , and with he be plenteous redemption .
and he shall redeem israel from all he iniquity .
lord , my heart be not haughty , nor mine eye lofty : neither do i exercise myself in great matter , or in thing too high for i .
surely i have behave and quiet myself , as a child that be wean of he mother : my soul be even as a wean child .
let israel hope in the lord from henceforth and for ever .
lord , remember david , and all he affliction :
how he sware unto the lord , and vow unto the mighty god of jacob ;
surely i will not come into the tabernacle of my house , nor go up into my bed ;
i will not give sleep to mine eye , or slumber to mine eyelid ,
until i find out a place for the lord , a habitation for the mighty god of jacob .
lo , we hear of it at ephratah : we find it in the field of the wood .
we will go into he tabernacle : we will worship at he footstool .
arise , o lord , into thy rest ; thou , and the ark of thy strength .
let thy priest be clothe with righteousness ; and let thy saint shout for joy .
for thy servant david 's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed .
the lord have swear in truth unto david ; he will not turn from it ; of the fruit of thy body will i set upon thy throne .
if thy child will keep my covenant and my testimony that i shall teach they , they child shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore .
for the lord have choose zion ; he have desire it for he habitation .
this be my rest for ever : here will i dwell ; for i have desire it .
i will abundantly bless she provision : i will satisfy she poor with bread .
i will also clothe she priest with salvation : and she saint shall shout aloud for joy .
there will i make the horn of david to bud : i have ordain a lamp for mine anointed .
he enemy will i clothe with shame : but upon himself shall he crown flourish .
behold , how good and how pleasant it be for brethren to dwell together in unity !
it be like the precious ointment upon the head , that run down upon the beard , even aaron 's beard : that go down to the skirt of he garment ;
as the dew of hermon , and as the dew that descend upon the mountain of zion : for there the lord command the blessing , even life for evermore .
behold , bless ye the lord , all ye servant of the lord , which by night stand in the house of the lord .
lift up you hand in the sanctuary , and bless the lord .
the lord that make heaven and earth bless thee out of zion .
praise ye the lord .
praise ye the name of the lord ; praise he , o ye servant of the lord .
ye that stand in the house of the lord , in the court of the house of we god ,
praise the lord ; for the lord be good : sing praise unto he name ; for it be pleasant .
for the lord have choose jacob unto himself , and israel for he peculiar treasure .
for i know that the lord be great , and that we lord be above all god .
whatsoever the lord pleased , that do he in heaven , and in earth , in the sea , and all deep place .
he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end of the earth ; he maketh lightning for the rain ; he bringeth the wind out of he treasury .
who smite the firstborn of egypt , both of man and beast .
who send token and wonder into the midst of thee , o egypt , upon pharaoh , and upon all he servant .
who smite great nation , and slew mighty king ;
sihon king of the amorites , and og king of bashan , and all the kingdom of canaan :
and give they land for a heritage , a heritage unto israel he people .
thy name , o lord , endureth for ever ; and thy memorial , o lord , throughout all generation .
for the lord will judge he people , and he will repent himself concern he servant .
the idol of the heathen be silver and gold , the work of man 's hand .
they have mouth , but they speak not ; eye have they , but they see not ;
they have ear , but they hear not ; neither be there any breath in they mouth .
they that make they be like unto they : so be every one that trusteth in they .
bless the lord , o house of israel : bless the lord , o house of aaron :
bless the lord , o house of levi : ye that fear the lord , bless the lord .
bless be the lord out of zion , which dwelleth at jerusalem .
praise ye the lord .

and have redeem we from we enemy : for he mercy endureth for ever .
who giveth food to all flesh : for he mercy endureth for ever .
o give thanks unto the god of heaven : for he mercy endureth for ever .
by the river of babylon , there we sit down , yea , we weep , when we remember zion .
we hang we harp upon the willow in the midst thereof .
for there they that carry we away captive require of we a song ; and they that waste we require of we mirth , say , sing we one of the song of zion .
how shall we sing the lord 's song in a strange land ?
if i forget thee , o jerusalem , let my right hand forget she cunning .
if i do not remember thee , let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth ; if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy .
remember , o lord , the child of edom in the day of jerusalem ; who say , rase it , rase it , even to the foundation thereof .
o daughter of babylon , who art to be destroy ; happy shall he be , that rewardeth thee as thou hast serve we .
happy shall he be , that taketh and dasheth thy little one against the stone .
i will praise thee with my whole heart : before the god will i sing praise unto thee .
i will worship toward thy holy temple , and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth : for thou hast magnify thy word above all thy name .
in the day when i cry thou answeredst i , and strengthenedst i with strength in my soul .
all the king of the earth shall praise thee , o lord , when they hear the word of thy mouth .
yea , they shall sing in the way of the lord : for great be the glory of the lord .
though the lord be high , yet have he respect unto the lowly : but the proud he knoweth afar off .
though i walk in the midst of trouble , thou wilt revive i : thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemy , and thy right hand shall save i .
the lord will perfect that which concerneth i : thy mercy , o lord , endureth for ever : forsake not the work of thine own hand .
o lord , thou hast search i , and know i .
thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising , thou understandest my thought afar off .
thou compassest my path and my lie down , and art acquaint with all my way .
for there be not a word in my tongue , but , lo , o lord , thou knowest it altogether .
thou hast beset i behind and before , and lay thine hand upon i .
such knowledge be too wonderful for i ; it be high , i can not attain unto it .
whither shall i go from thy spirit ? or whither shall i flee from thy presence ?
if i ascend up into heaven , thou art there : if i make my bed in hell , behold , thou art there .
if i take the wing of the morning , and dwell in the uttermost part of the sea ;
even there shall thy hand lead i , and thy right hand shall hold i .
if i say , surely the darkness shall cover i ; even the night shall be light about i .
yea , the darkness hideth not from thee ; but the night shineth as the day : the darkness and the light be both alike to thee .
for thou hast possess my rein : thou hast cover i in my mother 's womb .
i will praise thee ; for i be fearfully and wonderfully make : marvellous be thy work ; and that my soul knoweth right well .
my substance be not hide from thee , when i be make in secret , and curiously work in the lowest part of the earth .
thine eye do see my substance , yet be unperfect ; and in thy book all my member be write , which in continuance be fashion , when as yet there be none of they .
how precious also be thy thought unto i , o god ! how great be the sum of they !
if i should count they , they be more in number than the sand : when i awake , i be still with thee .
surely thou wilt slay the wicked , o god : depart from i therefore , ye bloody man .
for they speak against thee wickedly , and thine enemy take thy name in vain .
do not i hate they , o lord , that hate thee ? and be not i grieve with those that rise up against thee ?
i hate they with perfect hatred : i count they mine enemy .
search i , o god , and know my heart : try i , and know my thought :
and see if there be any wicked way in i , and lead i in the way everlasting .
deliver i , o lord , from the evil man : preserve i from the violent man ;
which imagine mischief in they heart ; continually be they gather together for war .
they have sharpen they tongue like a serpent ; adder ' poison be under they lip .
selah .
keep i , o lord , from the hand of the wicked ; preserve i from the violent man ; who have purpose to overthrow my going .
the proud have hide a snare for i , and cord ; they have spread a net by the wayside ; they have set gin for i .
selah .
i say unto the lord , thou art my god : hear the voice of my supplication , o lord .
o god the lord , the strength of my salvation , thou hast cover my head in the day of battle .
grant not , o lord , the desire of the wicked : further not he wicked device ; lest they exalt themselves .
selah .
as for the head of those that compass i about , let the mischief of they own lip cover they .
let burn coal fall upon they : let they be cast into the fire ; into deep pit , that they rise not up again .
let not a evil speaker be establish in the earth : evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow he .
i know that the lord will maintain the cause of the afflict , and the right of the poor .
surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name : the upright shall dwell in thy presence .
lord , i cry unto thee : make haste unto i ; give ear unto my voice , when i cry unto thee .
let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense ; and the lift up of my hand as the evening sacrifice .
set a watch , o lord , before my mouth ; keep the door of my lip .
incline not my heart to any evil thing , to practise wicked work with man that work iniquity : and let i not eat of they dainty .
let the righteous smite i ; it shall be a kindness : and let he reprove i ; it shall be a excellent oil , which shall not break my head : for yet my prayer also shall be in they calamity .
when they judge be overthrow in stony place , they shall hear my word ; for they be sweet .
we bone be scatter at the grave 's mouth , as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth .
but mine eye be unto thee , o god the lord : in thee be my trust ; leave not my soul destitute .
keep i from the snare which they have lay for i , and the gin of the worker of iniquity .
let the wicked fall into they own net , whilst that i withal escape .
i cry unto the lord with my voice ; with my voice unto the lord do i make my supplication .
i pour out my complaint before he ; i shew before he my trouble .
when my spirit be overwhelm within i , then thou knewest my path .
in the way wherein i walk have they privily lay a snare for i .
i look on my right hand , and beheld , but there be no man that would know i : refuge fail i ; no man care for my soul .
i cry unto thee , o lord : i say , thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living .
attend unto my cry ; for i be bring very low : deliver i from my persecutor ; for they be stronger than i.
bring my soul out of prison , that i may praise thy name : the righteous shall compass i about ; for thou shalt deal bountifully with i .
hear my prayer , o lord , give ear to my supplication : in thy faithfulness answer i , and in thy righteousness .
and enter not into judgment with thy servant : for in thy sight shall no man living be justify .
for the enemy have persecute my soul ; he have smitten my life down to the ground ; he have make i to dwell in darkness , as those that have be long dead .
therefore be my spirit overwhelm within i ; my heart within i be desolate .
i remember the day of old ; i meditate on all thy work ; i muse on the work of thy hand .
i stretch forth my hand unto thee : my soul thirsteth after thee , as a thirsty land .
selah .
hear i speedily , o lord : my spirit faileth : hide not thy face from i , lest i be like unto they that go down into the pit .
cause i to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning ; for in thee do i trust : cause i to know the way wherein i should walk ; for i lift up my soul unto thee .
deliver i , o lord , from mine enemy : i flee unto thee to hide i .
teach i to do thy will ; for thou art my god : thy spirit be good ; lead i into the land of uprightness .
quicken i , o lord , for thy name 's sake : for thy righteousness ' sake bring my soul out of trouble .
and of thy mercy cut off mine enemy , and destroy all they that afflict my soul : for i be thy servant .
bless be the lord my strength , which teacheth my hand to war , and my finger to fight :
my goodness , and my fortress ; my high tower , and my deliverer ; my shield , and he in whom i trust ; who subdueth my people under i .
lord , what be man , that thou takest knowledge of he ! or the son of man , that thou makest account of he !
man be like to vanity : he day be as a shadow that passeth away .
bow thy heaven , o lord , and come down : touch the mountain , and they shall smoke .
cast forth lightning , and scatter they : shoot out thine arrow , and destroy they .
send thine hand from above ; rid i , and deliver i out of great water , from the hand of strange child ;
whose mouth speaketh vanity , and they right hand be a right hand of falsehood .
i will sing a new song unto thee , o god : upon a psaltery and a instrument of ten string will i sing praise unto thee .
it be he that giveth salvation unto king : who delivereth david he servant from the hurtful sword .
rid i , and deliver i from the hand of strange child , whose mouth speaketh vanity , and they right hand be a right hand of falsehood :
that we son may be as plant grow up in they youth ; that we daughter may be as corner stone , polish after the similitude of a palace :
that we garner may be full , afford all manner of store : that we sheep may bring forth thousand and ten thousand in we street :
that we ox may be strong to labour ; that there be no breaking in , nor go out ; that there be no complain in we street .
happy be that people , that be in such a case : yea , happy be that people , whose god be the lord .
i will extol thee , my god , o king ; and i will bless thy name for ever and ever .
every day will i bless thee ; and i will praise thy name for ever and ever .
great be the lord , and greatly to be praise ; and he greatness be unsearchable .
one generation shall praise thy work to another , and shall declare thy mighty act .
i will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty , and of thy wondrous work .
and man shall speak of the might of thy terrible act : and i will declare thy greatness .
they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness , and shall sing of thy righteousness .
the lord be gracious , and full of compassion ; slow to anger , and of great mercy .
the lord be good to all : and he tender mercy be over all he work .
all thy work shall praise thee , o lord ; and thy saint shall bless thee .
they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom , and talk of thy power ;
to make know to the son of man he mighty act , and the glorious majesty of he kingdom .
thy kingdom be a everlasting kingdom , and thy dominion endureth throughout all generation .
the lord upholdeth all that fall , and raiseth up all those that be bow down .
the eye of all wait upon thee ; and thou givest they they meat in due season .
thou openest thine hand , and satisfiest the desire of every living thing .
the lord be righteous in all he way , and holy in all he work .
the lord be nigh unto all they that call upon he , to all that call upon he in truth .
he will fulfil the desire of they that fear he : he also will hear they cry , and will save they .
the lord preserveth all they that love he : but all the wicked will he destroy .
my mouth shall speak the praise of the lord : and let all flesh bless he holy name for ever and ever .
praise ye the lord .
praise the lord , o my soul .
while i live will i praise the lord : i will sing praise unto my god while i have any be .
put not you trust in prince , nor in the son of man , in whom there be no help .
he breath goeth forth , he returneth to he earth ; in that very day he thought perish .
happy be he that have the god of jacob for he help , whose hope be in the lord he god :
which make heaven , and earth , the sea , and all that therein be : which keepeth truth for ever :
which executeth judgment for the oppress : which giveth food to the hungry .
the lord looseth the prisoner :
the lord openeth the eye of the blind : the lord raiseth they that be bow down : the lord loveth the righteous :
the lord preserveth the stranger ; he relieveth the fatherless and widow : but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down .
the lord shall reign for ever , even thy god , o zion , unto all generation .
praise ye the lord .

he telleth the number of the star ; he calleth they all by they name .
great be we lord , and of great power : he understanding be infinite .
the lord lifteth up the meek : he casteth the wicked down to the ground .
sing unto the lord with thanksgiving ; sing praise upon the harp unto we god :
who covereth the heaven with cloud , who prepareth rain for the earth , who maketh grass to grow upon the mountain .
he giveth to the beast he food , and to the young raven which cry .
he delighteth not in the strength of the horse : he taketh not pleasure in the leg of a man .
the lord taketh pleasure in they that fear he , in those that hope in he mercy .

the proverb of solomon the son of david , king of israel ;
to know wisdom and instruction ; to perceive the word of understanding ;
to receive the instruction of wisdom , justice , and judgment , and equity ;
to give subtilty to the simple , to the young man knowledge and discretion .
a wise man will hear , and will increase learning ; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsel :
to understand a proverb , and the interpretation ; the word of the wise , and they dark saying .
the fear of the lord be the beginning of knowledge : but fool despise wisdom and instruction .
my son , hear the instruction of thy father , and forsake not the law of thy mother :
for they shall be a ornament of grace unto thy head , and chain about thy neck .
my son , if sinner entice thee , consent thou not .
if they say , come with we , let we lay wait for blood , let we lurk privily for the innocent without cause :
let we swallow they up alive as the grave ; and whole , as those that go down into the pit :
we shall find all precious substance , we shall fill we house with spoil :
cast in thy lot among we ; let we all have one purse :
my son , walk not thou in the way with they ; refrain thy foot from they path :
for they foot run to evil , and make haste to shed blood .
surely in vain the net be spread in the sight of any bird .
and they lay wait for they own blood ; they lurk privily for they own life .
so be the way of every one that be greedy of gain ; which taketh away the life of the owner thereof .
wisdom crieth without ; she uttereth she voice in the street :
she crieth in the chief place of concourse , in the opening of the gate : in the city she uttereth she word , say ,
how long , ye simple one , will ye love simplicity ? and the scorner delight in they scorning , and fool hate knowledge ?
turn you at my reproof : behold , i will pour out my spirit unto you , i will make known my word unto you .
because i have call , and ye refuse ; i have stretch out my hand , and no man regard ;
but ye have set at nought all my counsel , and would none of my reproof :
i also will laugh at you calamity ; i will mock when you fear cometh ;
when you fear cometh as desolation , and you destruction cometh as a whirlwind ; when distress and anguish cometh upon you .
then shall they call upon i , but i will not answer ; they shall seek i early , but they shall not find i :
for that they hate knowledge , and do not choose the fear of the lord :
they would none of my counsel : they despise all my reproof .
therefore shall they eat of the fruit of they own way , and be fill with they own device .
for the turn away of the simple shall slay they , and the prosperity of fool shall destroy they .
but whoso hearkeneth unto i shall dwell safely , and shall be quiet from fear of evil .
my son , if thou wilt receive my word , and hide my commandment with thee ;
so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom , and apply thine heart to understanding ;
yea , if thou criest after knowledge , and liftest up thy voice for understanding ;
if thou seekest she as silver , and searchest for she as for hide treasure ;
then shalt thou understand the fear of the lord , and find the knowledge of god .
for the lord giveth wisdom : out of he mouth cometh knowledge and understanding .
he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous : he be a buckler to they that walk uprightly .
he keepeth the path of judgment , and preserveth the way of he saint .
then shalt thou understand righteousness , and judgment , and equity ; yea , every good path .
when wisdom entereth into thine heart , and knowledge be pleasant unto thy soul ;
discretion shall preserve thee , understand shall keep thee :
to deliver thee from the way of the evil man , from the man that speaketh froward thing ;
who leave the path of uprightness , to walk in the way of darkness ;
who rejoice to do evil , and delight in the frowardness of the wicked ;
whose way be crooked , and they froward in they path :
to deliver thee from the strange woman , even from the stranger which flattereth with she word ;
which forsaketh the guide of she youth , and forgetteth the covenant of she god .
for she house inclineth unto death , and she path unto the dead .
none that go unto she return again , neither take they hold of the path of life .
that thou mayest walk in the way of good man , and keep the path of the righteous .
for the upright shall dwell in the land , and the perfect shall remain in it .
but the wicked shall be cut off from the earth , and the transgressor shall be root out of it .
my son , forget not my law ; but let thine heart keep my commandment :
for length of day , and long life , and peace , shall they add to thee .
let not mercy and truth forsake thee : bind they about thy neck ; write they upon the table of thine heart :
so shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of god and man .
trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding .
in all thy way acknowledge he , and he shall direct thy path .
be not wise in thine own eye : fear the lord , and depart from evil .
it shall be health to thy navel , and marrow to thy bone .
honour the lord with thy substance , and with the firstfruit of all thine increase :
so shall thy barn be fill with plenty , and thy press shall burst out with new wine .
my son , despise not the chastening of the lord ; neither be weary of he correction :
for whom the lord loveth he correcteth ; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth .
happy be the man that findeth wisdom , and the man that getteth understanding .
for the merchandise of it be better than the merchandise of silver , and the gain thereof than fine gold .
she be more precious than ruby : and all the thing thou canst desire be not to be compare unto she .
length of day be in she right hand ; and in she left hand riches and honour .
she way be way of pleasantness , and all she path be peace .
she be a tree of life to they that lay hold upon she : and happy be every one that retaineth she .
the lord by wisdom have found the earth ; by understand have he establish the heaven .
by he knowledge the depths be break up , and the cloud drop down the dew .
my son , let not they depart from thine eye : keep sound wisdom and discretion :
so shall they be life unto thy soul , and grace to thy neck .
then shalt thou walk in thy way safely , and thy foot shall not stumble .
when thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid : yea , thou shalt lie down , and thy sleep shall be sweet .
be not afraid of sudden fear , neither of the desolation of the wicked , when it cometh .
for the lord shall be thy confidence , and shall keep thy foot from be take .
withhold not good from they to whom it be due , when it be in the power of thine hand to do it .
say not unto thy neighbour , go , and come again , and to morrow i will give ; when thou hast it by thee .
devise not evil against thy neighbour , see he dwelleth securely by thee .
strive not with a man without cause , if he have do thee no harm .
envy thou not the oppressor , and choose none of he way .
for the froward be abomination to the lord : but he secret be with the righteous .
the curse of the lord be in the house of the wicked : but he blesseth the habitation of the just .
surely he scorneth the scorner : but he giveth grace unto the lowly .
the wise shall inherit glory : but shame shall be the promotion of fool .
hear , ye child , the instruction of a father , and attend to know understanding .
for i give you good doctrine , forsake ye not my law .
for i be my father 's son , tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother .
he teach i also , and say unto i , let thine heart retain my word : keep my commandment , and live .
get wisdom , get understanding : forget it not ; neither decline from the word of my mouth .
forsake she not , and she shall preserve thee : love she , and she shall keep thee .
wisdom be the principal thing ; therefore get wisdom : and with all thy get get understanding .
exalt she , and she shall promote thee : she shall bring thee to honour , when thou dost embrace she .
she shall give to thine head a ornament of grace : a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee .
hear , o my son , and receive my saying ; and the year of thy life shall be many .
i have teach thee in the way of wisdom ; i have lead thee in right path .
when thou goest , thy step shall not be straiten ; and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble .
take fast hold of instruction ; let she not go : keep she ; for she be thy life .
enter not into the path of the wicked , and go not in the way of evil man .
avoid it , pass not by it , turn from it , and pass away .
for they sleep not , except they have do mischief ; and they sleep be take away , unless they cause some to fall .
for they eat the bread of wickedness , and drink the wine of violence .
but the path of the just be as the shine light , that shineth more and more unto the perfect day .
the way of the wicked be as darkness : they know not at what they stumble .
my son , attend to my word ; incline thine ear unto my saying .
let they not depart from thine eye ; keep they in the midst of thine heart .
for they be life unto those that find they , and health to all they flesh .
keep thy heart with all diligence ; for out of it be the issue of life .
put away from thee a froward mouth , and perverse lip put far from thee .
let thine eye look right on , and let thine eyelid look straight before thee .
ponder the path of thy foot , and let all thy way be establish .
turn not to the right hand nor to the left : remove thy foot from evil .
my son , attend unto my wisdom , and bow thine ear to my understanding :
that thou mayest regard discretion , and that thy lip may keep knowledge .
for the lip of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb , and she mouth be smoother than oil :
but she end be bitter as wormwood , sharp as a two-edged sword .
she foot go down to death ; she step take hold on hell .
lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life , she way be moveable , that thou canst not know they .
hear i now therefore , o ye child , and depart not from the word of my mouth .
remove thy way far from she , and come not nigh the door of she house :
lest thou give thine honour unto other , and thy year unto the cruel :
lest stranger be fill with thy wealth ; and thy labour be in the house of a stranger ;
and thou mourn at the last , when thy flesh and thy body be consume ,
and say , how have i hate instruction , and my heart despise reproof ;
and have not obey the voice of my teacher , nor inclined mine ear to they that instruct i !
i be almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly .
drink water out of thine own cistern , and run water out of thine own well .
let thy fountain be disperse abroad , and river of water in the street .
let they be only thine own , and not stranger ' with thee .
let thy fountain be bless : and rejoice with the wife of thy youth .
let she be as the loving hind and pleasant roe ; let she breast satisfy thee at all time ; and be thou ravished always with she love .
and why wilt thou , my son , be ravish with a strange woman , and embrace the bosom of a stranger ?
for the way of man be before the eye of the lord , and he pondereth all he going .
he own iniquity shall take the wicked himself , and he shall be holden with the cord of he sin .
he shall die without instruction ; and in the greatness of he folly he shall go astray .
my son , if thou be surety for thy friend , if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger ,
thou art snare with the word of thy mouth , thou art take with the word of thy mouth .
do this now , my son , and deliver thyself , when thou art come into the hand of thy friend ; go , humble thyself , and make sure thy friend .
give not sleep to thine eye , nor slumber to thine eyelid .
deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler .
go to the ant , thou sluggard ; consider she way , and be wise :
which have no guide , overseer , or ruler ,
provideth she meat in the summer , and gathereth she food in the harvest .
how long wilt thou sleep , o sluggard ? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep ?
yet a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hand to sleep :
so shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth , and thy want as a armed man .
a naughty person , a wicked man , walketh with a froward mouth .
he winketh with he eye , he speaketh with he foot , he teacheth with he finger ;
frowardness be in he heart , he deviseth mischief continually ; he soweth discord .
therefore shall he calamity come suddenly ; suddenly shall he be break without remedy .
these six thing doth the lord hate : yea , seven be a abomination unto he :
a proud look , a lie tongue , and hand that shed innocent blood ,
a heart that deviseth wicked imagination , foot that be swift in run to mischief ,
a false witness that speaketh lie , and he that soweth discord among brethren .
my son , keep thy father 's commandment , and forsake not the law of thy mother :
bind they continually upon thine heart , and tie they about thy neck .
when thou goest , it shall lead thee ; when thou sleepest , it shall keep thee ; and when thou awakest , it shall talk with thee .
for the commandment be a lamp ; and the law be light ; and reproof of instruction be the way of life :
to keep thee from the evil woman , from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman .
lust not after she beauty in thine heart ; neither let she take thee with she eyelid .
for by means of a whorish woman a man be bring to a piece of bread : and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life .
can a man take fire in he bosom , and he clothes not be burn ?
can one go upon hot coal , and he foot not be burn ?
so he that goeth in to he neighbour 's wife ; whosoever toucheth she shall not be innocent .
man do not despise a thief , if he steal to satisfy he soul when he be hungry ;
but if he be find , he shall restore sevenfold ; he shall give all the substance of he house .
but whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding : he that doeth it destroyeth he own soul .
a wound and dishonour shall he get ; and he reproach shall not be wipe away .
for jealousy be the rage of a man : therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance .
he will not regard any ransom ; neither will he rest content , though thou givest many gift .
my son , keep my word , and lay up my commandment with thee .
keep my commandment , and live ; and my law as the apple of thine eye .
bind they upon thy finger , write they upon the table of thine heart .
say unto wisdom , thou art my sister ; and call understanding thy kinswoman :
that they may keep thee from the strange woman , from the stranger which flattereth with she word .
for at the window of my house i look through my casement ,
and beheld among the simple one , i discern among the youth , a young man void of understanding ,
pass through the street near she corner ; and he go the way to she house ,
in the twilight , in the evening , in the black and dark night :
and , behold , there meet he a woman with the attire of a harlot , and subtil of heart .
( she be loud and stubborn ; she foot abide not in she house :
now be she without , now in the street , and lieth in wait at every corner . )
so she catch he , and kiss he , and with a impudent face say unto he ,
i have peace offering with i ; this day have i pay my vow .
therefore come i forth to meet thee , diligently to seek thy face , and i have find thee .
i have deck my bed with covering of tapestry , with carve work , with fine linen of egypt .
i have perfumed my bed with myrrh , aloe , and cinnamon .
come , let we take we fill of love until the morning : let we solace ourselves with love .
for the goodman be not at home , he be go a long journey :
he have take a bag of money with he , and will come home at the day appoint .
with she much fair speech she cause he to yield , with the flattering of she lip she force he .
he goeth after she straightway , as a ox goeth to the slaughter , or as a fool to the correction of the stock ;
till a dart strike through he liver ; as a bird hasteth to the snare , and knoweth not that it be for he life .
hearken unto i now therefore , o ye child , and attend to the word of my mouth .
let not thine heart decline to she way , go not astray in she path .
for she have cast down many wound : yea , many strong man have be slay by she .
she house be the way to hell , go down to the chamber of death .
doth not wisdom cry ? and understand put forth she voice ?
she standeth in the top of high place , by the way in the place of the path .
she crieth at the gate , at the entry of the city , at the come in at the door .
unto you , o man , i call ; and my voice be to the son of man .

i love they that love i ; and those that seek i early shall find i .
riches and honour be with i ; yea , durable riches and righteousness .
my fruit be better than gold , yea , than fine gold ; and my revenue than choice silver .
i lead in the way of righteousness , in the midst of the path of judgment :

i be set up from everlasting , from the beginning , or ever the earth be .
when there be no depths , i be bring forth ; when there be no fountain abound with water .
before the mountain be settle , before the hill be i bring forth :
while as yet he have not make the earth , nor the field , nor the highest part of the dust of the world .
when he prepare the heaven , i be there : when he set a compass upon the face of the depth :
when he establish the cloud above : when he strengthen the fountain of the deep :
when he give to the sea he decree , that the water should not pass he commandment : when he appoint the foundation of the earth :
then i be by he , as one bring up with he : and i be daily he delight , rejoice always before he ;
rejoice in the habitable part of he earth ; and my delight be with the son of man .
now therefore hearken unto i , o ye child : for bless be they that keep my way .
hear instruction , and be wise , and refuse it not .
bless be the man that heareth i , watch daily at my gate , wait at the post of my door .
for whoso findeth i findeth life , and shall obtain favour of the lord .
but he that sinneth against i wrongeth he own soul : all they that hate i love death .

for she sitteth at the door of she house , on a seat in the high place of the city ,
to call passenger who go right on they way :

stolen water be sweet , and bread eat in secret be pleasant .
but he knoweth not that the dead be there ; and that she guest be in the depths of hell .

as the fine pot for silver , and the furnace for gold ; so be a man to he praise .
though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle , yet will not he foolishness depart from he .

the lamb be for thy clothing , and the goat be the price of the field .
and thou shalt have goat ' milk enough for thy food , for the food of thy household , and for the maintenance for thy maiden .

the word of agur the son of jakeh , even the prophecy : the man speak unto ithiel , even unto ithiel and ucal ,
surely i be more brutish than any man , and have not the understanding of a man .
i neither learn wisdom , nor have the knowledge of the holy .
who have ascend up into heaven , or descend ? who have gather the wind in he fist ? who have bind the water in a garment ? who have establish all the end of the earth ? what be he name , and what be he son 's name , if thou canst tell ?
every word of god be pure : he be a shield unto they that put they trust in he .
add thou not unto he word , lest he reprove thee , and thou be find a liar .
two thing have i require of thee ; deny i they not before i die :
remove far from i vanity and lie : give i neither poverty nor riches ; feed i with food convenient for i :
lest i be full , and deny thee , and say , who be the lord ? or lest i be poor , and steal , and take the name of my god in vain .
accuse not a servant unto he master , lest he curse thee , and thou be find guilty .

there be three thing which be too wonderful for i , yea , four which i know not :
the way of a eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maid .
such be the way of a adulterous woman ; she eateth , and wipeth she mouth , and saith , i have do no wickedness .
for three thing the earth be disquiet , and for four which it can not bear :
for a servant when he reigneth ; and a fool when he be fill with meat ;
for a odious woman when she be marry ; and a handmaid that be heir to she mistress .
there be four thing which be little upon the earth , but they be exceed wise :
the ant be a people not strong , yet they prepare they meat in the summer ;
the cony be but a feeble folk , yet make they they house in the rock ;
the locust have no king , yet go they forth all of they by band ;
the spider taketh hold with she hand , and be in king ' palace .

give not thy strength unto woman , nor thy way to that which destroyeth king .
it be not for king , o lemuel , it be not for king to drink wine ; nor for prince strong drink :
lest they drink , and forget the law , and pervert the judgment of any of the afflict .
give strong drink unto he that be ready to perish , and wine unto those that be of heavy heart .
let he drink , and forget he poverty , and remember he misery no more .
open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as be appoint to destruction .
open thy mouth , judge righteously , and plead the cause of the poor and needy .

she girdeth she loin with strength , and strengtheneth she arm .
she perceiveth that she merchandise be good : she candle goeth not out by night .

give she of the fruit of she hand ; and let she own work praise she in the gate .
the word of the preacher , the son of david , king in jerusalem .
vanity of vanity , saith the preacher , vanity of vanity ; all be vanity .
what profit have a man of all he labour which he taketh under the sun ?
one generation passeth away , and another generation cometh : but the earth abideth for ever .
the sun also ariseth , and the sun goeth down , and hasteth to he place where he arise .
the wind goeth toward the south , and turneth about unto the north ; it whirleth about continually , and the wind returneth again accord to he circuit .
all the river run into the sea ; yet the sea be not full ; unto the place from whence the river come , thither they return again .
all thing be full of labour ; man can not utter it : the eye be not satisfy with see , nor the ear fill with hearing .
the thing that have be , it be that which shall be ; and that which be do be that which shall be do : and there be no new thing under the sun .
be there any thing whereof it may be say , see , this be new ? it have be already of old time , which be before we .
there be no remembrance of former thing ; neither shall there be any remembrance of thing that be to come with those that shall come after .
i the preacher be king over israel in jerusalem .
and i give my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concern all thing that be do under heaven : this sore travail have god give to the son of man to be exercise therewith .
i have see all the work that be do under the sun ; and , behold , all be vanity and vexation of spirit .
that which be crooked can not be make straight : and that which be want can not be number .
i commune with mine own heart , say , lo , i be come to great estate , and have get more wisdom than all they that have be before i in jerusalem : yea , my heart have great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
and i give my heart to know wisdom , and to know madness and folly : i perceive that this also be vexation of spirit .
for in much wisdom be much grief : and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow .
i say in mine heart , go to now , i will prove thee with mirth , therefore enjoy pleasure : and , behold , this also be vanity .
i say of laughter , it be mad : and of mirth , what doeth it ?
i seek in mine heart to give myself unto wine , yet acquaint mine heart with wisdom ; and to lay hold on folly , till i might see what be that good for the son of man , which they should do under the heaven all the day of they life .
i make i great work ; i build i house ; i plant i vineyard :
i make i garden and orchard , and i plant tree in they of all kind of fruit :
i make i pool of water , to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth tree :
i get i servant and maiden , and have servant bear in my house ; also i have great possession of great and small cattle above all that be in jerusalem before i :
i gather i also silver and gold , and the peculiar treasure of king and of the province : i gat i man singer and woman singer , and the delight of the son of man , as musical instrument , and that of all sort .
so i be great , and increase more than all that be before i in jerusalem : also my wisdom remain with i .
and whatsoever mine eye desire i keep not from they , i withhold not my heart from any joy ; for my heart rejoice in all my labour : and this be my portion of all my labour .
then i look on all the work that my hand have work , and on the labour that i have labour to do : and , behold , all be vanity and vexation of spirit , and there be no profit under the sun .
and i turn myself to behold wisdom , and madness , and folly : for what can the man do that cometh after the king ? even that which have be already do .
then i see that wisdom excelleth folly , as far as light excelleth darkness .
the wise man 's eye be in he head ; but the fool walketh in darkness : and i myself perceive also that one event happeneth to they all .
then say i in my heart , as it happeneth to the fool , so it happeneth even to i ; and why be i then more wise ?
then i say in my heart , that this also be vanity .
for there be no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever ; see that which now be in the day to come shall all be forget .
and how dieth the wise man ? as the fool .
therefore i hate life ; because the work that be work under the sun be grievous unto i : for all be vanity and vexation of spirit .
yea , i hate all my labour which i have take under the sun : because i should leave it unto the man that shall be after i .
and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool ? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have labour , and wherein i have shew myself wise under the sun .
this be also vanity .
therefore i go about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which i take under the sun .
for there be a man whose labour be in wisdom , and in knowledge , and in equity ; yet to a man that have not laboured therein shall he leave it for he portion .
this also be vanity and a great evil .
for what have man of all he labour , and of the vexation of he heart , wherein he have labour under the sun ?
for all he day be sorrow , and he travail grief ; yea , he heart taketh not rest in the night .
this be also vanity .
there be nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make he soul enjoy good in he labour .
this also i see , that it be from the hand of god .
for who can eat , or who else can hasten hereunto , more than i ?
for god giveth to a man that be good in he sight wisdom , and knowledge , and joy : but to the sinner he giveth travail , to gather and to heap up , that he may give to he that be good before god .
this also be vanity and vexation of spirit .
to every thing there be a season , and a time to every purpose under the heaven :
a time to be bear , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which be plant ;
a time to kill , and a time to heal ; a time to break down , and a time to build up ;
a time to weep , and a time to laugh ; a time to mourn , and a time to dance ;
a time to cast away stone , and a time to gather stone together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embrace ;
a time to get , and a time to lose ; a time to keep , and a time to cast away ;
a time to rend , and a time to sew ; a time to keep silence , and a time to speak ;
a time to love , and a time to hate ; a time of war , and a time of peace .
what profit have he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth ?
i have see the travail , which god have give to the son of man to be exercise in it .
he have make every thing beautiful in he time : also he have set the world in they heart , so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the begin to the end .
i know that there be no good in they , but for a man to rejoice , and to do good in he life .
and also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy the good of all he labour , it be the gift of god .
i know that , whatsoever god doeth , it shall be for ever : nothing can be put to it , nor any thing take from it : and god doeth it , that man should fear before he .
that which have be be now ; and that which be to be have already be ; and god requireth that which be past .
and moreover i see under the sun the place of judgment , that wickedness be there ; and the place of righteousness , that iniquity be there .
i say in mine heart , god shall judge the righteous and the wicked : for there be a time there for every purpose and for every work .
i say in mine heart concern the estate of the son of man , that god might manifest they , and that they might see that they themselves be beast .
for that which befalleth the son of man befalleth beast ; even one thing befalleth they : as the one dieth , so dieth the other ; yea , they have all one breath ; so that a man have no preeminence above a beast : for all be vanity .
all go unto one place ; all be of the dust , and all turn to dust again .
who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ?
wherefore i perceive that there be nothing better , than that a man should rejoice in he own work ; for that be he portion : for who shall bring he to see what shall be after he ?
so i return , and consider all the oppression that be do under the sun : and behold the tear of such as be oppress , and they have no comforter ; and on the side of they oppressor there be power ; but they have no comforter .
wherefore i praise the dead which be already dead more than the living which be yet alive .
yea , better be he than both they , which have not yet be , who have not see the evil work that be do under the sun .
again , i consider all travail , and every right work , that for this a man be envy of he neighbour .
this be also vanity and vexation of spirit .
the fool foldeth he hand together , and eateth he own flesh .
better be a handful with quietness , than both the hand full with travail and vexation of spirit .
then i return , and i see vanity under the sun .
there be one alone , and there be not a second ; yea , he have neither child nor brother : yet be there no end of all he labour ; neither be he eye satisfy with riches ; neither saith he , for whom do i labour , and bereave my soul of good ?
this be also vanity , yea , it be a sore travail .
two be better than one ; because they have a good reward for they labour .
for if they fall , the one will lift up he fellow : but woe to he that be alone when he falleth ; for he have not another to help he up .
again , if two lie together , then they have heat : but how can one be warm alone ?
and if one prevail against he , two shall withstand he ; and a threefold cord be not quickly break .
better be a poor and a wise child than a old and foolish king , who will no more be admonish .
for out of prison he cometh to reign ; whereas also he that be bear in he kingdom becometh poor .
i consider all the living which walk under the sun , with the second child that shall stand up in he stead .
there be no end of all the people , even of all that have be before they : they also that come after shall not rejoice in he .
surely this also be vanity and vexation of spirit .
keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of god , and be more ready to hear , than to give the sacrifice of fool : for they consider not that they do evil .
be not rash with thy mouth , and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before god : for god be in heaven , and thou upon earth : therefore let thy word be few .
for a dream cometh through the multitude of business ; and a fool 's voice be know by multitude of word .
when thou vowest a vow unto god , defer not to pay it ; for he have no pleasure in fool : pay that which thou hast vow .
better be it that thou shouldest not vow , than that thou shouldest vow and not pay .
suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin ; neither say thou before the angel , that it be a error : wherefore should god be angry at thy voice , and destroy the work of thine hand ?
for in the multitude of dream and many word there be also diver vanity : but fear thou god .
if thou seest the oppression of the poor , and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province , marvel not at the matter : for he that be higher than the highest regardeth ; and there be higher than they .
moreover the profit of the earth be for all : the king himself be serve by the field .
he that loveth silver shall not be satisfy with silver ; nor he that loveth abundance with increase : this be also vanity .
when goods increase , they be increase that eat they : and what good be there to the owner thereof , save the beholding of they with they eye ?
the sleep of a labouring man be sweet , whether he eat little or much : but the abundance of the rich will not suffer he to sleep .
there be a sore evil which i have see under the sun , namely , riches keep for the owner thereof to they hurt .
but those riches perish by evil travail : and he begetteth a son , and there be nothing in he hand .
as he come forth of he mother 's womb , naked shall he return to go as he come , and shall take nothing of he labour , which he may carry away in he hand .
and this also be a sore evil , that in all point as he come , so shall he go : and what profit have he that have laboured for the wind ?
all he day also he eateth in darkness , and he have much sorrow and wrath with he sickness .
behold that which i have see : it be good and comely for one to eat and to drink , and to enjoy the good of all he labour that he taketh under the sun all the day of he life , which god giveth he : for it be he portion .
every man also to whom god have give riches and wealth , and have give he power to eat thereof , and to take he portion , and to rejoice in he labour ; this be the gift of god .
for he shall not much remember the day of he life ; because god answereth he in the joy of he heart .
there be a evil which i have see under the sun , and it be common among man :
a man to whom god have give riches , wealth , and honour , so that he wanteth nothing for he soul of all that he desireth , yet god giveth he not power to eat thereof , but a stranger eateth it : this be vanity , and it be a evil disease .
if a man beget a hundred child , and live many year , so that the day of he year be many , and he soul be not fill with good , and also that he have no burial ; i say , that a untimely birth be better than he .
for he cometh in with vanity , and departeth in darkness , and he name shall be cover with darkness .
moreover he have not see the sun , nor known any thing : this have more rest than the other .
yea , though he live a thousand year twice tell , yet have he see no good : do not all go to one place ?
all the labour of man be for he mouth , and yet the appetite be not fill .
for what have the wise more than the fool ? what have the poor , that knoweth to walk before the living ?
better be the sight of the eye than the wander of the desire : this be also vanity and vexation of spirit .
that which have be be name already , and it be know that it be man : neither may he contend with he that be mightier than he .
see there be many thing that increase vanity , what be man the better ?
for who knoweth what be good for man in this life , all the day of he vain life which he spendeth as a shadow ? for who can tell a man what shall be after he under the sun ?
a good name be better than precious ointment ; and the day of death than the day of one 's birth .
it be better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of feast : for that be the end of all man ; and the living will lay it to he heart .
sorrow be better than laughter : for by the sadness of the countenance the heart be make better .
the heart of the wise be in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fool be in the house of mirth .
it be better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fool .
for as the crackling of thorn under a pot , so be the laughter of the fool : this also be vanity .
surely oppression maketh a wise man mad ; and a gift destroyeth the heart .
better be the end of a thing than the begin thereof : and the patient in spirit be better than the proud in spirit .
be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry : for anger resteth in the bosom of fool .
say not thou , what be the cause that the former day be better than these ? for thou dost not enquire wisely concern this .
wisdom be good with a inheritance : and by it there be profit to they that see the sun .
for wisdom be a defence , and money be a defence : but the excellency of knowledge be , that wisdom giveth life to they that have it .
consider the work of god : for who can make that straight , which he have make crooked ?
in the day of prosperity be joyful , but in the day of adversity consider : god also have set the one over against the other , to the end that man should find nothing after he .
all thing have i see in the day of my vanity : there be a just man that perisheth in he righteousness , and there be a wicked man that prolongeth he life in he wickedness .
be not righteous over much ; neither make thyself over wise : why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
be not over much wicked , neither be thou foolish : why shouldest thou die before thy time ?
it be good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from this withdraw not thine hand : for he that feareth god shall come forth of they all .
wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty man which be in the city .
for there be not a just man upon earth , that doeth good , and sinneth not .
also take no heed unto all word that be speak ; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee :
for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed other .
all this have i prove by wisdom : i say , i will be wise ; but it be far from i .
that which be far off , and exceed deep , who can find it out ?
i apply mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom , and the reason of thing , and to know the wickedness of folly , even of foolishness and madness :
and i find more bitter than death the woman , whose heart be snare and net , and she hand as band : whoso pleaseth god shall escape from she ; but the sinner shall be take by she .
behold , this have i find , saith the preacher , count one by one , to find out the account :
which yet my soul seeketh , but i find not : one man among a thousand have i find ; but a woman among all those have i not find .
lo , this only have i find , that god have make man upright ; but they have seek out many invention .
who be as the wise man ? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom maketh he face to shine , and the boldness of he face shall be change .
i counsel thee to keep the king 's commandment , and that in regard of the oath of god .
be not hasty to go out of he sight : stand not in a evil thing ; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth he .
where the word of a king be , there be power : and who may say unto he , what doest thou ?
whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing : and a wise man 's heart discerneth both time and judgment .
because to every purpose there be time and judgment , therefore the misery of man be great upon he .
for he knoweth not that which shall be : for who can tell he when it shall be ?
there be no man that have power over the spirit to retain the spirit ; neither have he power in the day of death : and there be no discharge in that war ; neither shall wickedness deliver those that be give to it .
all this have i see , and apply my heart unto every work that be do under the sun : there be a time wherein one man ruleth over another to he own hurt .
and so i see the wicked bury , who have come and go from the place of the holy , and they be forget in the city where they have so do : this be also vanity .
because sentence against a evil work be not execute speedily , therefore the heart of the son of man be fully set in they to do evil .
though a sinner do evil a hundred time , and he day be prolong , yet surely i know that it shall be well with they that fear god , which fear before he :
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he prolong he day , which be as a shadow ; because he feareth not before god .
there be a vanity which be do upon the earth ; that there be just man , unto whom it happeneth accord to the work of the wicked ; again , there be wicked man , to whom it happeneth accord to the work of the righteous : i say that this also be vanity .
then i commend mirth , because a man have no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be merry : for that shall abide with he of he labour the day of he life , which god giveth he under the sun .
when i apply mine heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that be do upon the earth : ( for also there be that neither day nor night seeth sleep with he eye : )
then i behold all the work of god , that a man can not find out the work that be do under the sun : because though a man labour to seek it out , yet he shall not find it ; yea farther ; though a wise man think to know it , yet shall he not be able to find it .
for all this i consider in my heart even to declare all this , that the righteous , and the wise , and they work , be in the hand of god : no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that be before they .
all thing come alike to all : there be one event to the righteous , and to the wicked ; to the good and to the clean , and to the unclean ; to he that sacrificeth , and to he that sacrificeth not : as be the good , so be the sinner ; and he that sweareth , as he that feareth a oath .
this be a evil among all thing that be do under the sun , that there be one event unto all : yea , also the heart of the son of man be full of evil , and madness be in they heart while they live , and after that they go to the dead .
for to he that be join to all the living there be hope : for a living dog be better than a dead lion .
for the living know that they shall die : but the dead know not any thing , neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of they be forget .
also they love , and they hatred , and they envy , be now perish ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that be do under the sun .
go thy way , eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with a merry heart ; for god now accepteth thy work .
let thy garment be always white ; and let thy head lack no ointment .
live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the day of the life of thy vanity , which he have give thee under the sun , all the day of thy vanity : for that be thy portion in this life , and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun .
whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with thy might ; for there be no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in the grave , whither thou goest .
i return , and see under the sun , that the race be not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong , neither yet bread to the wise , nor yet riches to man of understanding , nor yet favour to man of skill ; but time and chance happeneth to they all .
for man also knoweth not he time : as the fish that be take in a evil net , and as the bird that be catch in the snare ; so be the son of man snare in a evil time , when it falleth suddenly upon they .
this wisdom have i see also under the sun , and it seem great unto i :
there be a little city , and few man within it ; and there come a great king against it , and besiege it , and build great bulwark against it :
now there be find in it a poor wise man , and he by he wisdom deliver the city ; yet no man remember that same poor man .
then say i , wisdom be better than strength : nevertheless the poor man 's wisdom be despise , and he word be not hear .
the word of wise man be hear in quiet more than the cry of he that ruleth among fool .
wisdom be better than weapon of war : but one sinner destroyeth much good .
dead fly cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stink savour : so doth a little folly he that be in reputation for wisdom and honour .
a wise man 's heart be at he right hand ; but a fool 's heart at he left .
yea also , when he that be a fool walketh by the way , he wisdom faileth he , and he saith to every one that he be a fool .
if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee , leave not thy place ; for yield pacifieth great offence .
there be a evil which i have see under the sun , as a error which proceedeth from the ruler :
folly be set in great dignity , and the rich sit in low place .
i have see servant upon horse , and prince walk as servant upon the earth .
he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it ; and whoso breaketh a hedge , a serpent shall bite he .
whoso removeth stone shall be hurt therewith ; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endanger thereby .
if the iron be blunt , and he do not whet the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wisdom be profitable to direct .
surely the serpent will bite without enchantment ; and a babbler be no better .
the word of a wise man 's mouth be gracious ; but the lip of a fool will swallow up himself .
the beginning of the word of he mouth be foolishness : and the end of he talk be mischievous madness .
a fool also be full of word : a man can not tell what shall be ; and what shall be after he , who can tell he ?
the labour of the foolish wearieth every one of they , because he knoweth not how to go to the city .
woe to thee , o land , when thy king be a child , and thy prince eat in the morning !
blessed art thou , o land , when thy king be the son of noble , and thy prince eat in due season , for strength , and not for drunkenness !
by much slothfulness the building decayeth ; and through idleness of the hand the house droppeth through .
a feast be make for laughter , and wine maketh merry : but money answereth all thing .
curse not the king , no not in thy thought ; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber : for a bird of the air shall carry the voice , and that which have wing shall tell the matter .
cast thy bread upon the water : for thou shalt find it after many day .
give a portion to seven , and also to eight ; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth .
if the cloud be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
he that observeth the wind shall not sow ; and he that regardeth the cloud shall not reap .
as thou knowest not what be the way of the spirit , nor how the bone do grow in the womb of she that be with child : even so thou knowest not the work of god who maketh all .
in the morning sow thy seed , and in the evening withhold not thine hand : for thou knowest not whether shall prosper , either this or that , or whether they both shall be alike good .
truly the light be sweet , and a pleasant thing it be for the eye to behold the sun :
but if a man live many year , and rejoice in they all ; yet let he remember the day of darkness ; for they shall be many .
all that cometh be vanity .
rejoice , o young man , in thy youth ; and let thy heart cheer thee in the day of thy youth , and walk in the way of thine heart , and in the sight of thine eye : but know thou , that for all these thing god will bring thee into judgment .
therefore remove sorrow from thy heart , and put away evil from thy flesh : for childhood and youth be vanity .
remember now thy creator in the day of thy youth , while the evil day come not , nor the year draw nigh , when thou shalt say , i have no pleasure in they ;
while the sun , or the light , or the moon , or the star , be not darken , nor the cloud return after the rain :
in the day when the keeper of the house shall tremble , and the strong man shall bow themselves , and the grinder cease because they be few , and those that look out of the window be darken ,
and the door shall be shut in the street , when the sound of the grind be low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the daughter of musick shall be bring low ;
also when they shall be afraid of that which be high , and fear shall be in the way , and the almond tree shall flourish , and the grasshopper shall be a burden , and desire shall fail : because man goeth to he long home , and the mourner go about the street :
or ever the silver cord be loose , or the golden bowl be break , or the pitcher be break at the fountain , or the wheel break at the cistern .
then shall the dust return to the earth as it be : and the spirit shall return unto god who give it .
vanity of vanity , saith the preacher ; all be vanity .
and moreover , because the preacher be wise , he still teach the people knowledge ; yea , he give good heed , and seek out , and set in order many proverb .
the preacher seek to find out acceptable word : and that which be write be upright , even word of truth .
the word of the wise be as goad , and as nail fasten by the master of assembly , which be give from one shepherd .
and further , by these , my son , be admonish : of make many book there be no end ; and much study be a weariness of the flesh .
let we hear the conclusion of the whole matter : fear god , and keep he commandment : for this be the whole duty of man .
for god shall bring every work into judgment , with every secret thing , whether it be good , or whether it be evil .
the song of song , which be solomon 's .
let he kiss i with the kiss of he mouth : for thy love be better than wine .
because of the savour of thy good ointment thy name be as ointment pour forth , therefore do the virgin love thee .
draw i , we will run after thee : the king have bring i into he chamber : we will be glad and rejoice in thee , we will remember thy love more than wine : the upright love thee .
i be black , but comely , o ye daughter of jerusalem , as the tent of kedar , as the curtain of solomon .
look not upon i , because i be black , because the sun have look upon i : my mother 's child be angry with i ; they make i the keeper of the vineyard ; but mine own vineyard have i not keep .
tell i , o thou whom my soul loveth , where thou feedest , where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon : for why should i be as one that turneth aside by the flock of thy companion ?
if thou know not , o thou fairest among woman , go thy way forth by the footstep of the flock , and feed thy kid beside the shepherd ' tent .
i have compare thee , o my love , to a company of horse in pharaoh 's chariot .
thy cheek be comely with row of jewel , thy neck with chain of gold .
we will make thee border of gold with stud of silver .
while the king sitteth at he table , my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof .
a bundle of myrrh be my well-beloved unto i ; he shall lie all night betwixt my breast .
my beloved be unto i as a cluster of camphire in the vineyard of engedi .
behold , thou art fair , my love ; behold , thou art fair ; thou hast dove ' eye .
behold , thou art fair , my beloved , yea , pleasant : also we bed be green .
the beam of we house be cedar , and we rafter of fir .
i be the rose of sharon , and the lily of the valley .
as the lily among thorn , so be my love among the daughter .
as the apple tree among the tree of the wood , so be my beloved among the son .
i sit down under he shadow with great delight , and he fruit be sweet to my taste .
he bring i to the banqueting house , and he banner over i be love .
stay i with flagon , comfort i with apple : for i be sick of love .
he left hand be under my head , and he right hand doth embrace i .
i charge you , o ye daughter of jerusalem , by the roe , and by the hind of the field , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , till he please .
the voice of my beloved ! behold , he cometh leap upon the mountain , skip upon the hill .
my beloved be like a roe or a young hart : behold , he standeth behind we wall , he looketh forth at the window , shew himself through the lattice .
my beloved spake , and say unto i , rise up , my love , my fair one , and come away .
for , lo , the winter be past , the rain be over and go ;
the flower appear on the earth ; the time of the singing of bird be come , and the voice of the turtle be hear in we land ;
the fig tree putteth forth she green fig , and the vine with the tender grape give a good smell .
arise , my love , my fair one , and come away .
o my dive , that art in the cleft of the rock , in the secret place of the stair , let i see thy countenance , let i hear thy voice ; for sweet be thy voice , and thy countenance be comely .
take we the fox , the little fox , that spoil the vine : for we vine have tender grape .
my beloved be mine , and i be he : he feedeth among the lily .
until the day break , and the shadow flee away , turn , my beloved , and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountain of bether .
by night on my bed i seek he whom my soul loveth : i seek he , but i find he not .
i will rise now , and go about the city in the street , and in the broad way i will seek he whom my soul loveth : i seek he , but i find he not .
the watchman that go about the city find i : to whom i say , see ye he whom my soul loveth ?
it be but a little that i pass from they , but i find he whom my soul loveth : i hold he , and would not let he go , until i have bring he into my mother 's house , and into the chamber of she that conceive i .
i charge you , o ye daughter of jerusalem , by the roe , and by the hind of the field , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , till he please .
who be this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillar of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all powder of the merchant ?
behold he bed , which be solomon 's ; threescore valiant man be about it , of the valiant of israel .
they all hold sword , be expert in war : every man have he sword upon he thigh because of fear in the night .
king solomon make himself a chariot of the wood of lebanon .
he make the pillar thereof of silver , the bottom thereof of gold , the covering of it of purple , the midst thereof be pave with love , for the daughter of jerusalem .
go forth , o ye daughter of zion , and behold king solomon with the crown wherewith he mother crown he in the day of he espousal , and in the day of the gladness of he heart .
behold , thou art fair , my love ; behold , thou art fair ; thou hast dove ' eye within thy lock : thy hair be as a flock of goat , that appear from mount gilead .
thy tooth be like a flock of sheep that be even shear , which come up from the wash ; whereof every one bear twin , and none be barren among they .
thy lip be like a thread of scarlet , and thy speech be comely : thy temple be like a piece of a pomegranate within thy lock .

thou art all fair , my love ; there be no spot in thee .
come with i from lebanon , my spouse , with i from lebanon : look from the top of amana , from the top of shenir and hermon , from the lion ' den , from the mountain of the leopard .
thou hast ravish my heart , my sister , my spouse ; thou hast ravish my heart with one of thine eye , with one chain of thy neck .
how fair be thy love , my sister , my spouse ! how much better be thy love than wine ! and the smell of thine ointment than all spice !
thy lip , o my spouse , drop as the honeycomb : honey and milk be under thy tongue ; and the smell of thy garment be like the smell of lebanon .
a garden inclose be my sister , my spouse ; a spring shut up , a fountain seal .
thy plant be a orchard of pomegranate , with pleasant fruit ; camphire , with spikenard ,
spikenard and saffron ; calamus and cinnamon , with all tree of frankincense ; myrrh and aloe , with all the chief spice :
a fountain of garden , a well of live water , and stream from lebanon .
awake , o north wind ; and come , thou south ; blow upon my garden , that the spice thereof may flow out .
let my beloved come into he garden , and eat he pleasant fruit .
i be come into my garden , my sister , my spouse : i have gather my myrrh with my spice ; i have eat my honeycomb with my honey ; i have drunk my wine with my milk : eat , o friend ; drink , yea , drink abundantly , o beloved .
i sleep , but my heart waketh : it be the voice of my beloved that knocketh , say , open to i , my sister , my love , my dive , my undefiled : for my head be fill with dew , and my lock with the drop of the night .
i have put off my coat ; how shall i put it on ?
i have wash my foot ; how shall i defile they ?
my beloved put in he hand by the hole of the door , and my bowels be move for he .
i rise up to open to my beloved ; and my hand drop with myrrh , and my finger with sweet smell myrrh , upon the handle of the lock .
i open to my beloved ; but my beloved have withdraw himself , and be go : my soul fail when he speak : i seek he , but i could not find he ; i call he , but he give i no answer .
the watchman that go about the city find i , they smite i , they wound i ; the keeper of the wall take away my veil from i .
i charge you , o daughter of jerusalem , if ye find my beloved , that ye tell he , that i be sick of love .
what be thy beloved more than another beloved , o thou fairest among woman ? what be thy beloved more than another beloved , that thou dost so charge we ?
my beloved be white and ruddy , the chiefest among ten thousand .

he mouth be most sweet : yea , he be altogether lovely .
this be my beloved , and this be my friend , o daughter of jerusalem .
whither be thy beloved go , o thou fairest among woman ? whither be thy beloved turn aside ? that we may seek he with thee .
my beloved be go down into he garden , to the bed of spice , to feed in the garden , and to gather lily .
i be my beloved 's , and my beloved be mine : he feedeth among the lily .
thou art beautiful , o my love , as tirzah , comely as jerusalem , terrible as a army with banner .
turn away thine eye from i , for they have overcome i : thy hair be as a flock of goat that appear from gilead .
thy tooth be as a flock of sheep which go up from the wash , whereof every one beareth twin , and there be not one barren among they .
as a piece of a pomegranate be thy temple within thy lock .
there be threescore queen , and fourscore concubine , and virgin without number .
my dive , my undefiled be but one ; she be the only one of she mother , she be the choice one of she that bare she .
the daughter see she , and bless she ; yea , the queen and the concubine , and they praise she .
who be she that looketh forth as the morning , fair as the moon , clear as the sun , and terrible as a army with banner ?
i go down into the garden of nut to see the fruit of the valley , and to see whether the vine flourish , and the pomegranate bud .
or ever i be aware , my soul make i like the chariot of amminadib .
return , return , o shulamite ; return , return , that we may look upon thee .
what will ye see in the shulamite ?
as it be the company of two army .
how beautiful be thy foot with shoe , o prince 's daughter ! the joint of thy thigh be like jewel , the work of the hand of a cunning workman .
thy navel be like a round goblet , which wanteth not liquor : thy belly be like a heap of wheat set about with lily .
thy two breast be like two young roe that be twin .
thy neck be as a tower of ivory ; thine eye like the fishpool in heshbon , by the gate of bathrabbim : thy nose be as the tower of lebanon which looketh toward damascus .

how fair and how pleasant art thou , o love , for delight !
this thy stature be like to a palm tree , and thy breast to cluster of grape .
i say , i will go up to the palm tree , i will take hold of the bough thereof : now also thy breast shall be as cluster of the vine , and the smell of thy nose like apple ;
and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved , that goeth down sweetly , cause the lip of those that be asleep to speak .
i be my beloved 's , and he desire be toward i .
come , my beloved , let we go forth into the field ; let we lodge in the village .
let we get up early to the vineyard ; let we see if the vine flourish , whether the tender grape appear , and the pomegranate bud forth : there will i give thee my love .
the mandrake give a smell , and at we gate be all manner of pleasant fruit , new and old , which i have lay up for thee , o my beloved .
o that thou wert as my brother , that suck the breast of my mother ! when i should find thee without , i would kiss thee ; yea , i should not be despise .
i would lead thee , and bring thee into my mother 's house , who would instruct i : i would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate .
he left hand should be under my head , and he right hand should embrace i .
i charge you , o daughter of jerusalem , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , until he please .
who be this that cometh up from the wilderness , lean upon she beloved ?
i raise thee up under the apple tree : there thy mother bring thee forth : there she bring thee forth that bare thee .
set i as a seal upon thine heart , as a seal upon thine arm : for love be strong as death ; jealousy be cruel as the grave : the coal thereof be coal of fire , which have a most vehement flame .
many water can not quench love , neither can the flood drown it : if a man would give all the substance of he house for love , it would utterly be contemn .
we have a little sister , and she have no breast : what shall we do for we sister in the day when she shall be speak for ?
if she be a wall , we will build upon she a palace of silver : and if she be a door , we will inclose she with board of cedar .
i be a wall , and my breast like tower : then be i in he eye as one that find favour .
solomon have a vineyard at baalhamon ; he let out the vineyard unto keeper ; every one for the fruit thereof be to bring a thousand piece of silver .
my vineyard , which be mine , be before i : thou , o solomon , must have a thousand , and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred .
thou that dwellest in the garden , the companion hearken to thy voice : cause i to hear it .
make haste , my beloved , and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountain of spice .
the vision of isaiah the son of amoz , which he see concern judah and jerusalem in the day of uzziah , jotham , ahaz , and hezekiah , king of judah .
hear , o heaven , and give ear , o earth : for the lord have speak , i have nourish and bring up child , and they have rebel against i .
the ox knoweth he owner , and the ass he master 's crib : but israel doth not know , my people doth not consider .
ah sinful nation , a people laden with iniquity , a seed of evildoer , child that be corrupter : they have forsake the lord , they have provoke the holy one of israel unto anger , they be go away backward .
why should ye be stricken any more ? ye will revolt more and more : the whole head be sick , and the whole heart faint .
from the sole of the foot even unto the head there be no soundness in it ; but wound , and bruise , and putrify sore : they have not be close , neither bind up , neither mollify with ointment .
you country be desolate , you city be burn with fire : you land , stranger devour it in you presence , and it be desolate , as overthrow by stranger .
and the daughter of zion be leave as a cottage in a vineyard , as a lodge in a garden of cucumber , as a besiege city .
except the lord of host have leave unto we a very small remnant , we should have be as sodom , and we should have be like unto gomorrah .
hear the word of the lord , ye ruler of sodom ; give ear unto the law of we god , ye people of gomorrah .
to what purpose be the multitude of you sacrifice unto i ? saith the lord : i be full of the burnt offering of ram , and the fat of fed beast ; and i delight not in the blood of bullock , or of lamb , or of he goat .
when ye come to appear before i , who have require this at you hand , to tread my court ?
bring no more vain oblation ; incense be a abomination unto i ; the new moon and sabbath , the calling of assembly , i can not away with ; it be iniquity , even the solemn meeting .
you new moon and you appoint feast my soul hateth : they be a trouble unto i ; i be weary to bear they .
and when ye spread forth you hand , i will hide mine eye from you : yea , when ye make many prayer , i will not hear : you hand be full of blood .
wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of you doings from before mine eye ; cease to do evil ;
learn to do well ; seek judgment , relieve the oppressed , judge the fatherless , plead for the widow .
come now , and let we reason together , saith the lord : though you sin be as scarlet , they shall be as white as snow ; though they be red like crimson , they shall be as wool .
if ye be willing and obedient , ye shall eat the good of the land :
but if ye refuse and rebel , ye shall be devour with the sword : for the mouth of the lord have speak it .
how be the faithful city become a harlot ! it be full of judgment ; righteousness lodge in it ; but now murderer .
thy silver be become dross , thy wine mix with water :
thy prince be rebellious , and companion of thief : every one loveth gift , and followeth after reward : they judge not the fatherless , neither doth the cause of the widow come unto they .
therefore saith the lord , the lord of host , the mighty one of israel , ah , i will ease i of mine adversary , and avenge i of mine enemy :
and i will turn my hand upon thee , and purely purge away thy dross , and take away all thy tin :
and i will restore thy judge as at the first , and thy counsellor as at the beginning : afterward thou shalt be call , the city of righteousness , the faithful city .
zion shall be redeem with judgment , and she convert with righteousness .
and the destruction of the transgressor and of the sinner shall be together , and they that forsake the lord shall be consume .
for they shall be ashamed of the oak which ye have desire , and ye shall be confound for the garden that ye have choose .
for ye shall be as a oak whose leaf fadeth , and as a garden that have no water .
and the strong shall be as tow , and the maker of it as a spark , and they shall both burn together , and none shall quench they .
the word that isaiah the son of amoz see concern judah and jerusalem .
and it shall come to pass in the last day , that the mountain of the lord 's house shall be establish in the top of the mountain , and shall be exalt above the hill ; and all nation shall flow unto it .
and many people shall go and say , come ye , and let we go up to the mountain of the lord , to the house of the god of jacob ; and he will teach we of he way , and we will walk in he path : for out of zion shall go forth the law , and the word of the lord from jerusalem .
and he shall judge among the nation , and shall rebuke many people : and they shall beat they sword into plowshare , and they spear into pruninghook : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
o house of jacob , come ye , and let we walk in the light of the lord .
therefore thou hast forsake thy people the house of jacob , because they be replenish from the east , and be soothsayer like the philistines , and they please themselves in the child of stranger .
they land also be full of silver and gold , neither be there any end of they treasure ; they land be also full of horse , neither be there any end of they chariot :
they land also be full of idol ; they worship the work of they own hand , that which they own finger have make :
and the mean man boweth down , and the great man humbleth himself : therefore forgive they not .
enter into the rock , and hide thee in the dust , for fear of the lord , and for the glory of he majesty .
the lofty look of man shall be humble , and the haughtiness of man shall be bow down , and the lord alone shall be exalt in that day .
for the day of the lord of host shall be upon every one that be proud and lofty , and upon every one that be lift up ; and he shall be bring low :
and upon all the cedar of lebanon , that be high and lift up , and upon all the oak of bashan ,
and upon all the high mountain , and upon all the hill that be lift up ,
and upon every high tower , and upon every fenced wall ,
and upon all the ship of tarshish , and upon all pleasant picture .
and the loftiness of man shall be bow down , and the haughtiness of man shall be make low : and the lord alone shall be exalt in that day .
and the idol he shall utterly abolish .
and they shall go into the hole of the rock , and into the cave of the earth , for fear of the lord , and for the glory of he majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
in that day a man shall cast he idol of silver , and he idol of gold , which they make each one for himself to worship , to the mole and to the bat ;
to go into the cleft of the rock , and into the top of the ragged rock , for fear of the lord , and for the glory of he majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
cease ye from man , whose breath be in he nostril : for wherein be he to be account of ?
for , behold , the lord , the lord of host , doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the staff , the whole stay of bread , and the whole stay of water .
the mighty man , and the man of war , the judge , and the prophet , and the prudent , and the ancient ,
the captain of fifty , and the honourable man , and the counsellor , and the cunning artificer , and the eloquent orator .
and i will give child to be they prince , and babe shall rule over they .
and the people shall be oppress , every one by another , and every one by he neighbour : the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient , and the base against the honourable .
when a man shall take hold of he brother of the house of he father , say , thou hast clothing , be thou we ruler , and let this ruin be under thy hand :
in that day shall he swear , say , i will not be a healer ; for in my house be neither bread nor clothing : make i not a ruler of the people .
for jerusalem be ruin , and judah be fall : because they tongue and they doings be against the lord , to provoke the eye of he glory .
the shew of they countenance doth witness against they ; and they declare they sin as sodom , they hide it not .
woe unto they soul ! for they have reward evil unto themselves .
say ye to the righteous , that it shall be well with he : for they shall eat the fruit of they doings .
woe unto the wicked ! it shall be ill with he : for the reward of he hand shall be give he .
as for my people , child be they oppressor , and woman rule over they .
o my people , they which lead thee cause thee to err , and destroy the way of thy path .
the lord standeth up to plead , and standeth to judge the people .
the lord will enter into judgment with the ancient of he people , and the prince thereof : for ye have eat up the vineyard ; the spoil of the poor be in you house .
what mean ye that ye beat my people to piece , and grind the face of the poor ? saith the lord god of host .
moreover the lord saith , because the daughter of zion be haughty , and walk with stretch forth neck and wanton eye , walk and mince as they go , and make a tinkle with they foot :
therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughter of zion , and the lord will discover they secret part .
in that day the lord will take away the bravery of they tinkling ornament about they foot , and they caul , and they round tire like the moon ,
the chain , and the bracelet , and the muffler ,
the bonnet , and the ornament of the leg , and the headband , and the tablet , and the earring ,
the ring , and nose jewel ,
the changeable suit of apparel , and the mantle , and the wimple , and the crisp pin ,
the glass , and the fine linen , and the hood , and the vail .
and it shall come to pass , that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink ; and instead of a girdle a rent ; and instead of well set hair baldness ; and instead of a stomacher a gird of sackcloth ; and burn instead of beauty .
thy man shall fall by the sword , and thy mighty in the war .
and she gate shall lament and mourn ; and she be desolate shall sit upon the ground .
and in that day seven woman shall take hold of one man , say , we will eat we own bread , and wear we own apparel : only let we be call by thy name , to take away we reproach .
in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for they that be escape of israel .
and it shall come to pass , that he that be leave in zion , and he that remaineth in jerusalem , shall be call holy , even every one that be write among the living in jerusalem :
when the lord shall have wash away the filth of the daughter of zion , and shall have purge the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion , and upon she assembly , a cloud and smoke by day , and the shine of a flaming fire by night : for upon all the glory shall be a defence .
and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat , and for a place of refuge , and for a covert from storm and from rain .
now will i sing to my wellbelove a song of my beloved touch he vineyard .
my wellbeloved have a vineyard in a very fruitful hill :
and he fence it , and gather out the stone thereof , and plant it with the choicest vine , and build a tower in the midst of it , and also make a winepress therein : and he look that it should bring forth grape , and it bring forth wild grape .
and now , o inhabitant of jerusalem , and man of judah , judge , i pray you , betwixt i and my vineyard .
what could have be do more to my vineyard , that i have not do in it ? wherefore , when i look that it should bring forth grape , bring it forth wild grape ?
and now go to ; i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard : i will take away the hedge thereof , and it shall be eat up ; and break down the wall thereof , and it shall be trodden down :
and i will lay it waste : it shall not be prune , nor dig ; but there shall come up brier and thorn : i will also command the cloud that they rain no rain upon it .
for the vineyard of the lord of host be the house of israel , and the man of judah he pleasant plant : and he look for judgment , but behold oppression ; for righteousness , but behold a cry .
woe unto they that join house to house , that lay field to field , till there be no place , that they may be place alone in the midst of the earth !
in mine ear say the lord of host , of a truth many house shall be desolate , even great and fair , without inhabitant .
yea , ten acre of vineyard shall yield one bath , and the seed of a homer shall yield a ephah .
woe unto they that rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; that continue until night , till wine inflame they !
and the harp , and the viol , the tabret , and pipe , and wine , be in they feast : but they regard not the work of the lord , neither consider the operation of he hand .
therefore my people be go into captivity , because they have no knowledge : and they honourable man be famish , and they multitude dry up with thirst .
therefore hell have enlarged herself , and open she mouth without measure : and they glory , and they multitude , and they pomp , and he that rejoiceth , shall descend into it .
and the mean man shall be bring down , and the mighty man shall be humble , and the eye of the lofty shall be humble :
but the lord of host shall be exalt in judgment , and god that be holy shall be sanctify in righteousness .
then shall the lamb feed after they manner , and the waste place of the fat one shall stranger eat .
woe unto they that draw iniquity with cord of vanity , and sin as it be with a cart rope :
that say , let he make speed , and hasten he work , that we may see it : and let the counsel of the holy one of israel draw nigh and come , that we may know it !
woe unto they that call evil good , and good evil ; that put darkness for light , and light for darkness ; that put bitter for sweet , and sweet for bitter !
woe unto they that be wise in they own eye , and prudent in they own sight !
woe unto they that be mighty to drink wine , and man of strength to mingle strong drink :
which justify the wicked for reward , and take away the righteousness of the righteous from he !
therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble , and the flame consumeth the chaff , so they root shall be as rottenness , and they blossom shall go up as dust : because they have cast away the law of the lord of host , and despise the word of the holy one of israel .
therefore be the anger of the lord kindle against he people , and he have stretch forth he hand against they , and have smitten they : and the hill do tremble , and they carcase be tear in the midst of the street .
for all this he anger be not turn away , but he hand be stretch out still .
and he will lift up a ensign to the nation from far , and will hiss unto they from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
none shall be weary nor stumble among they ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the girdle of they loin be loose , nor the latchet of they shoe be break :
whose arrow be sharp , and all they bow bent , they horse ' hoof shall be count like flint , and they wheel like a whirlwind :
they roaring shall be like a lion , they shall roar like young lion : yea , they shall roar , and lay hold of the prey , and shall carry it away safe , and none shall deliver it .
and in that day they shall roar against they like the roaring of the sea : and if one look unto the land , behold darkness and sorrow , and the light be darken in the heaven thereof .
in the year that king uzziah die i see also the lord sit upon a throne , high and lift up , and he train fill the temple .
above it stand the seraphim : each one have six wing ; with twain he cover he face , and with twain he cover he foot , and with twain he do fly .
and one cry unto another , and say , holy , holy , holy , be the lord of host : the whole earth be full of he glory .
and the post of the door move at the voice of he that cry , and the house be fill with smoke .
then say i , woe be i ! for i be undo ; because i be a man of unclean lip , and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lip : for mine eye have see the king , the lord of host .
then fly one of the seraphim unto i , have a live coal in he hand , which he have take with the tong from off the altar :
and he lay it upon my mouth , and say , lo , this have touch thy lip ; and thine iniquity be take away , and thy sin purge .
also i hear the voice of the lord , say , whom shall i send , and who will go for we ?
then say i , here be i ; send i .
and he say , go , and tell this people , hear ye indeed , but understand not ; and see ye indeed , but perceive not .
make the heart of this people fat , and make they ear heavy , and shut they eye ; lest they see with they eye , and hear with they ear , and understand with they heart , and convert , and be heal .
then say i , lord , how long ?
and he answer , until the city be waste without inhabitant , and the house without man , and the land be utterly desolate ,
and the lord have remove man far away , and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land .
but yet in it shall be a tenth , and it shall return , and shall be eat : as a teil tree , and as a oak , whose substance be in they , when they cast they leaf : so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof .
and it come to pass in the day of ahaz the son of jotham , the son of uzziah , king of judah , that rezin the king of syria , and pekah the son of remaliah , king of israel , go up toward jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
and it be tell the house of david , say , syria be confederate with ephraim .
and he heart be move , and the heart of he people , as the tree of the wood be move with the wind .
then say the lord unto isaiah , go forth now to meet ahaz , thou , and shearjashub thy son , at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller 's field ;
and say unto he , take heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be faintheart for the two tail of these smoking firebrand , for the fierce anger of rezin with syria , and of the son of remaliah .
because syria , ephraim , and the son of remaliah , have take evil counsel against thee , say ,
let we go up against judah , and vex it , and let we make a breach therein for we , and set a king in the midst of it , even the son of tabeal :
thus saith the lord god , it shall not stand , neither shall it come to pass .
for the head of syria be damascus , and the head of damascus be rezin ; and within threescore and five year shall ephraim be break , that it be not a people .
and the head of ephraim be samaria , and the head of samaria be remaliah 's son .
if ye will not believe , surely ye shall not be establish .
moreover the lord spake again unto ahaz , say ,
ask thee a sign of the lord thy god ; ask it either in the depth , or in the height above .
but ahaz say , i will not ask , neither will i tempt the lord .
and he say , hear ye now , o house of david ; be it a small thing for you to weary man , but will ye weary my god also ?
therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign ; behold , a virgin shall conceive , and bear a son , and shall call he name immanuel .
butter and honey shall he eat , that he may know to refuse the evil , and choose the good .
for before the child shall know to refuse the evil , and choose the good , the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsake of both she king .
the lord shall bring upon thee , and upon thy people , and upon thy father 's house , day that have not come , from the day that ephraim depart from judah ; even the king of assyria .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the lord shall hiss for the fly that be in the uttermost part of the river of egypt , and for the bee that be in the land of assyria .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of they in the desolate valley , and in the hole of the rock , and upon all thorn , and upon all bush .
in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that be hire , namely , by they beyond the river , by the king of assyria , the head , and the hair of the foot : and it shall also consume the beard .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a man shall nourish a young cow , and two sheep ;
and it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that be leave in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there be a thousand vine at a thousand silverling , it shall even be for brier and thorn .
with arrow and with bow shall man come thither ; because all the land shall become brier and thorn .
and on all hill that shall be dig with the mattock , there shall not come thither the fear of brier and thorn : but it shall be for the send forth of ox , and for the treading of lesser cattle .
moreover the lord say unto i , take thee a great roll , and write in it with a man 's pen concern mahershalalhashbaz .
and i take unto i faithful witness to record , uriah the priest , and zechariah the son of jeberechiah .
and i go unto the prophetess ; and she conceive , and bare a son .
then say the lord to i , call he name mahershalalhashbaz .
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry , my father , and my mother , the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be take away before the king of assyria .
the lord spake also unto i again , say ,
forasmuch as this people refuseth the water of shiloah that go softly , and rejoice in rezin and remaliah 's son ;
now therefore , behold , the lord bringeth up upon they the water of the river , strong and many , even the king of assyria , and all he glory : and he shall come up over all he channel , and go over all he bank :
and he shall pass through judah ; he shall overflow and go over , he shall reach even to the neck ; and the stretch out of he wing shall fill the breadth of thy land , o immanuel .
associate yourselve , o ye people , and ye shall be break in piece ; and give ear , all ye of far country : gird yourselve , and ye shall be break in piece ; gird yourselve , and ye shall be break in piece .
take counsel together , and it shall come to nought ; speak the word , and it shall not stand : for god be with we .
for the lord spake thus to i with a strong hand , and instruct i that i should not walk in the way of this people , say ,
say ye not , a confederacy , to all they to whom this people shall say , a confederacy ; neither fear ye they fear , nor be afraid .
sanctify the lord of host himself ; and let he be you fear , and let he be you dread .
and he shall be for a sanctuary ; but for a stone of stumble and for a rock of offence to both the house of israel , for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitant of jerusalem .
and many among they shall stumble , and fall , and be break , and be snare , and be take .
bind up the testimony , seal the law among my disciple .
and i will wait upon the lord , that hideth he face from the house of jacob , and i will look for he .
behold , i and the child whom the lord have give i be for sign and for wonder in israel from the lord of host , which dwelleth in mount zion .
and when they shall say unto you , seek unto they that have familiar spirit , and unto wizard that peep , and that mutter : should not a people seek unto they god ? for the live to the dead ?
to the law and to the testimony : if they speak not accord to this word , it be because there be no light in they .
and they shall pass through it , hardly bestead and hungry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hungry , they shall fret themselves , and curse they king and they god , and look upward .
and they shall look unto the earth ; and behold trouble and darkness , dimness of anguish ; and they shall be drive to darkness .
nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as be in she vexation , when at the first he lightly afflict the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali , and afterward do more grievously afflict she by the way of the sea , beyond jordan , in galilee of the nation .
the people that walk in darkness have see a great light : they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death , upon they have the light shine .
thou hast multiply the nation , and not increase the joy : they joy before thee accord to the joy in harvest , and as man rejoice when they divide the spoil .
for thou hast break the yoke of he burden , and the staff of he shoulder , the rod of he oppressor , as in the day of midian .
for every battle of the warrior be with confused noise , and garment roll in blood ; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire .
for unto we a child be bear , unto we a son be give : and the government shall be upon he shoulder : and he name shall be call wonderful , counsellor , the mighty god , the everlasting father , the prince of peace .
of the increase of he government and peace there shall be no end , upon the throne of david , and upon he kingdom , to order it , and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever .
the zeal of the lord of host will perform this .
the lord send a word into jacob , and it have light upon israel .
and all the people shall know , even ephraim and the inhabitant of samaria , that say in the pride and stoutness of heart ,
the brick be fall down , but we will build with hew stone : the sycomore be cut down , but we will change they into cedar .
therefore the lord shall set up the adversary of rezin against he , and join he enemy together ;
the syrians before , and the philistines behind ; and they shall devour israel with open mouth .
for all this he anger be not turn away , but he hand be stretch out still .
for the people turneth not unto he that smiteth they , neither do they seek the lord of host .
therefore the lord will cut off from israel head and tail , branch and rush , in one day .
the ancient and honourable , he be the head ; and the prophet that teacheth lie , he be the tail .
for the leader of this people cause they to err ; and they that be lead of they be destroy .
therefore the lord shall have no joy in they young man , neither shall have mercy on they fatherless and widow : for every one be a hypocrite and a evildoer , and every mouth speaketh folly .
for all this he anger be not turn away , but he hand be stretch out still .
for wickedness burneth as the fire : it shall devour the brier and thorn , and shall kindle in the thicket of the forest , and they shall mount up like the lift up of smoke .
through the wrath of the lord of host be the land darken , and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire : no man shall spare he brother .
and he shall snatch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfy : they shall eat every man the flesh of he own arm :
manasseh , ephraim ; and ephraim , manasseh : and they together shall be against judah .
for all this he anger be not turn away , but he hand be stretch out still .
woe unto they that decree unrighteous decree , and that write grievousness which they have prescribe ;
to turn aside the needy from judgment , and to take away the right from the poor of my people , that widow may be they prey , and that they may rob the fatherless !
and what will ye do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave you glory ?
without i they shall bow down under the prisoner , and they shall fall under the slay .
for all this he anger be not turn away , but he hand be stretch out still .
o assyrian , the rod of mine anger , and the staff in they hand be mine indignation .
i will send he against a hypocritical nation , and against the people of my wrath will i give he a charge , to take the spoil , and to take the prey , and to tread they down like the mire of the street .
howbeit he meaneth not so , neither doth he heart think so ; but it be in he heart to destroy and cut off nation not a few .
for he saith , be not my prince altogether king ?
be not calno as carchemish ? be not hamath as arpad ? be not samaria as damascus ?
as my hand have find the kingdom of the idol , and whose graven image do excel they of jerusalem and of samaria ;
shall i not , as i have do unto samaria and she idol , so do to jerusalem and she idol ?
wherefore it shall come to pass , that when the lord have perform he whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem , i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria , and the glory of he high look .
for he saith , by the strength of my hand i have do it , and by my wisdom ; for i be prudent : and i have remove the bound of the people , and have rob they treasure , and i have put down the inhabitant like a valiant man :
and my hand have find as a nest the riches of the people : and as one gathereth egg that be leave , have i gather all the earth ; and there be none that move the wing , or open the mouth , or peep .
shall the axe boast itself against he that heweth therewith ? or shall the saw magnify itself against he that shaketh it ? as if the rod should shake itself against they that lift it up , or as if the staff should lift up itself , as if it be no wood .
therefore shall the lord , the lord of host , send among he fat one leanness ; and under he glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire .
and the light of israel shall be for a fire , and he holy one for a flame : and it shall burn and devour he thorn and he brier in one day ;
and shall consume the glory of he forest , and of he fruitful field , both soul and body : and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth .
and the rest of the tree of he forest shall be few , that a child may write they .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the remnant of israel , and such as be escape of the house of jacob , shall no more again stay upon he that smite they ; but shall stay upon the lord , the holy one of israel , in truth .
the remnant shall return , even the remnant of jacob , unto the mighty god .
for though thy people israel be as the sand of the sea , yet a remnant of they shall return : the consumption decree shall overflow with righteousness .
for the lord god of host shall make a consumption , even determine , in the midst of all the land .
therefore thus saith the lord god of host , o my people that dwellest in zion , be not afraid of the assyrian : he shall smite thee with a rod , and shall lift up he staff against thee , after the manner of egypt .
for yet a very little while , and the indignation shall cease , and mine anger in they destruction .
and the lord of host shall stir up a scourge for he accord to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb : and as he rod be upon the sea , so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that he burden shall be take away from off thy shoulder , and he yoke from off thy neck , and the yoke shall be destroy because of the anointing .
he be come to aiath , he be pass to migron ; at michmash he have lay up he carriage :
they be go over the passage : they have take up they lodging at geba ; ramah be afraid ; gibeah of saul be flee .
lift up thy voice , o daughter of gallim : cause it to be hear unto laish , o poor anathoth .
madmenah be remove ; the inhabitant of gebim gather themselves to flee .
as yet shall he remain at nob that day : he shall shake he hand against the mount of the daughter of zion , the hill of jerusalem .
behold , the lord , the lord of host , shall lop the bough with terror : and the high one of stature shall be hew down , and the haughty shall be humble .
and he shall cut down the thicket of the forest with iron , and lebanon shall fall by a mighty one .
and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse , and a branch shall grow out of he root :
and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon he , the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord ;
and shall make he of quick understanding in the fear of the lord : and he shall not judge after the sight of he eye , neither reprove after the hearing of he ear :
but with righteousness shall he judge the poor , and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth : and he shall smite the earth with the rod of he mouth , and with the breath of he lip shall he slay the wicked .
and righteousness shall be the girdle of he loin , and faithfulness the girdle of he rein .
the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb , and the leopard shall lie down with the kid ; and the calf and the young lion and the fatle together ; and a little child shall lead they .
and the cow and the bear shall feed ; they young one shall lie down together : and the lion shall eat straw like the ox .
and the suck child shall play on the hole of the asp , and the wean child shall put he hand on the cockatrice ' den .
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain : for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord , as the water cover the sea .
and in that day there shall be a root of jesse , which shall stand for a ensign of the people ; to it shall the gentiles seek : and he rest shall be glorious .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the lord shall set he hand again the second time to recover the remnant of he people , which shall be leave , from assyria , and from egypt , and from pathros , and from cush , and from elam , and from shinar , and from hamath , and from the island of the sea .
and he shall set up a ensign for the nation , and shall assemble the outcast of israel , and gather together the disperse of judah from the four corner of the earth .
the envy also of ephraim shall depart , and the adversary of judah shall be cut off : ephraim shall not envy judah , and judah shall not vex ephraim .
but they shall fly upon the shoulder of the philistines toward the west ; they shall spoil they of the east together : they shall lay they hand upon edom and moab ; and the child of ammon shall obey they .
and the lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the egyptian sea ; and with he mighty wind shall he shake he hand over the river , and shall smite it in the seven stream , and make man go over dryshod .
and there shall be a highway for the remnant of he people , which shall be leave , from assyria ; like as it be to israel in the day that he come up out of the land of egypt .
and in that day thou shalt say , o lord , i will praise thee : though thou wast angry with i , thine anger be turn away , and thou comfortedst i .
behold , god be my salvation ; i will trust , and not be afraid : for the lord jehovah be my strength and my song ; he also be become my salvation .
therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the well of salvation .
and in that day shall ye say , praise the lord , call upon he name , declare he doings among the people , make mention that he name be exalt .
sing unto the lord ; for he have do excellent thing : this be know in all the earth .
cry out and shout , thou inhabitant of zion : for great be the holy one of israel in the midst of thee .
the burden of babylon , which isaiah the son of amoz do see .
lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain , exalt the voice unto they , shake the hand , that they may go into the gate of the noble .
i have command my sanctified one , i have also call my mighty one for mine anger , even they that rejoice in my highness .
the noise of a multitude in the mountain , like as of a great people ; a tumultuous noise of the kingdom of nation gather together : the lord of host mustereth the host of the battle .
they come from a far country , from the end of heaven , even the lord , and the weapon of he indignation , to destroy the whole land .
howl ye ; for the day of the lord be at hand ; it shall come as a destruction from the almighty .
therefore shall all hand be faint , and every man 's heart shall melt :
and they shall be afraid : pang and sorrow shall take hold of they ; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth : they shall be amaze one at another ; they face shall be as flame .
behold , the day of the lord cometh , cruel both with wrath and fierce anger , to lay the land desolate : and he shall destroy the sinner thereof out of it .
for the star of heaven and the constellation thereof shall not give they light : the sun shall be darken in he go forth , and the moon shall not cause she light to shine .
and i will punish the world for they evil , and the wicked for they iniquity ; and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease , and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible .
i will make a man more precious than fine gold ; even a man than the golden wedge of ophir .
therefore i will shake the heaven , and the earth shall remove out of she place , in the wrath of the lord of host , and in the day of he fierce anger .
and it shall be as the chase roe , and as a sheep that no man taketh up : they shall every man turn to he own people , and flee every one into he own land .
every one that be find shall be thrust through ; and every one that be join unto they shall fall by the sword .
they child also shall be dash to piece before they eye ; they house shall be spoil , and they wife ravish .
behold , i will stir up the medes against they , which shall not regard silver ; and as for gold , they shall not delight in it .
they bow also shall dash the young man to piece ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb ; they eye shall not spare child .
and babylon , the glory of kingdom , the beauty of the chaldees ' excellency , shall be as when god overthrow sodom and gomorrah .
it shall never be inhabit , neither shall it be dwell in from generation to generation : neither shall the arabian pitch tent there ; neither shall the shepherd make they fold there .
but wild beast of the desert shall lie there ; and they house shall be full of doleful creature ; and owl shall dwell there , and satyr shall dance there .
and the wild beast of the island shall cry in they desolate house , and dragon in they pleasant palace : and she time be near to come , and she day shall not be prolong .
for the lord will have mercy on jacob , and will yet choose israel , and set they in they own land : and the stranger shall be join with they , and they shall cleave to the house of jacob .
and the people shall take they , and bring they to they place : and the house of israel shall possess they in the land of the lord for servant and handmaid : and they shall take they captive , whose captive they be ; and they shall rule over they oppressor .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow , and from thy fear , and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast make to serve ,
that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of babylon , and say , how have the oppressor cease ! the golden city cease !
the lord have break the staff of the wicked , and the sceptre of the ruler .
he who smite the people in wrath with a continual stroke , he that rule the nation in anger , be persecute , and none hindereth .
the whole earth be at rest , and be quiet : they break forth into singing .
yea , the fir tree rejoice at thee , and the cedar of lebanon , say , since thou art lay down , no feller be come up against we .
hell from beneath be move for thee to meet thee at thy come : it stirreth up the dead for thee , even all the chief one of the earth ; it have raise up from they throne all the king of the nation .
all they shall speak and say unto thee , art thou also become weak as we ? art thou become like unto we ?
thy pomp be bring down to the grave , and the noise of thy viol : the worm be spread under thee , and the worm cover thee .
how art thou fall from heaven , o lucifer , son of the morning ! how art thou cut down to the ground , which do weaken the nation !
for thou hast say in thine heart , i will ascend into heaven , i will exalt my throne above the star of god : i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation , in the side of the north :
i will ascend above the height of the cloud ; i will be like the most high .
yet thou shalt be bring down to hell , to the side of the pit .
they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee , and consider thee , say , be this the man that make the earth to tremble , that do shake kingdom ;
that make the world as a wilderness , and destroy the city thereof ; that open not the house of he prisoner ?
all the king of the nation , even all of they , lie in glory , every one in he own house .
but thou art cast out of thy grave like a abominable branch , and as the raiment of those that be slay , thrust through with a sword , that go down to the stone of the pit ; as a carcase trodden under foot .
thou shalt not be join with they in burial , because thou hast destroy thy land , and slay thy people : the seed of evildoer shall never be renown .
prepare slaughter for he child for the iniquity of they father ; that they do not rise , nor possess the land , nor fill the face of the world with city .
for i will rise up against they , saith the lord of host , and cut off from babylon the name , and remnant , and son , and nephew , saith the lord .
i will also make it a possession for the bittern , and pool of water : and i will sweep it with the besom of destruction , saith the lord of host .
the lord of host have swear , say , surely as i have think , so shall it come to pass ; and as i have purpose , so shall it stand :
that i will break the assyrian in my land , and upon my mountain tread he under foot : then shall he yoke depart from off they , and he burden depart from off they shoulder .
this be the purpose that be purpose upon the whole earth : and this be the hand that be stretch out upon all the nation .
for the lord of host have purpose , and who shall disannul it ? and he hand be stretch out , and who shall turn it back ?
in the year that king ahaz die be this burden .
rejoice not thou , whole palestina , because the rod of he that smite thee be break : for out of the serpent 's root shall come forth a cockatrice , and he fruit shall be a fiery fly serpent .
and the firstborn of the poor shall feed , and the needy shall lie down in safety : and i will kill thy root with famine , and he shall slay thy remnant .
howl , o gate ; cry , o city ; thou , whole palestina , art dissolve : for there shall come from the north a smoke , and none shall be alone in he appointed time .
what shall one then answer the messenger of the nation ?
that the lord have found zion , and the poor of he people shall trust in it .
the burden of moab .
because in the night ar of moab be lay waste , and bring to silence ; because in the night kir of moab be lay waste , and bring to silence ;
he be go up to bajith , and to dibon , the high place , to weep : moab shall howl over nebo , and over medeba : on all they head shall be baldness , and every beard cut off .
in they street they shall gird themselves with sackcloth : on the top of they house , and in they street , every one shall howl , weep abundantly .
and heshbon shall cry , and elealeh : they voice shall be hear even unto jahaz : therefore the armed soldier of moab shall cry out ; he life shall be grievous unto he .
my heart shall cry out for moab ; he fugitive shall flee unto zoar , a heifer of three year old : for by the mount up of luhith with weep shall they go it up ; for in the way of horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction .
for the water of nimrim shall be desolate : for the hay be wither away , the grass faileth , there be no green thing .
therefore the abundance they have get , and that which they have lay up , shall they carry away to the brook of the willow .
for the cry be go round about the border of moab ; the howling thereof unto eglaim , and the howling thereof unto beerelim .
for the water of dimon shall be full of blood : for i will bring more upon dimon , lion upon he that escapeth of moab , and upon the remnant of the land .
send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from sela to the wilderness , unto the mount of the daughter of zion .
for it shall be , that , as a wander bird cast out of the nest , so the daughter of moab shall be at the ford of arnon .
take counsel , execute judgment ; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday ; hide the outcast ; bewray not he that wandereth .
let mine outcast dwell with thee , moab ; be thou a covert to they from the face of the spoiler : for the extortioner be at a end , the spoiler ceaseth , the oppressor be consume out of the land .
and in mercy shall the throne be establish : and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of david , judge , and seek judgment , and hasting righteousness .
we have hear of the pride of moab ; he be very proud : even of he haughtiness , and he pride , and he wrath : but he lie shall not be so .
therefore shall moab howl for moab , every one shall howl : for the foundation of kirhareseth shall ye mourn ; surely they be stricken .
for the field of heshbon languish , and the vine of sibmah : the lord of the heathen have break down the principal plant thereof , they be come even unto jazer , they wander through the wilderness : she branch be stretch out , they be go over the sea .
therefore i will bewail with the weep of jazer the vine of sibmah : i will water thee with my tear , o heshbon , and elealeh : for the shout for thy summer fruit and for thy harvest be fall .
and gladness be take away , and joy out of the plentiful field ; and in the vineyard there shall be no singing , neither shall there be shout : the treader shall tread out no wine in they press ; i have make they vintage shout to cease .
wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for moab , and mine inward part for kirharesh .
and it shall come to pass , when it be see that moab be weary on the high place , that he shall come to he sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail .
this be the word that the lord have speak concern moab since that time .
but now the lord have speak , say , within three year , as the year of a hireling , and the glory of moab shall be contemn , with all that great multitude ; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble .
the burden of damascus .
behold , damascus be take away from be a city , and it shall be a ruinous heap .
the city of aroer be forsake : they shall be for flock , which shall lie down , and none shall make they afraid .
the fortress also shall cease from ephraim , and the kingdom from damascus , and the remnant of syria : they shall be as the glory of the child of israel , saith the lord of host .
and in that day it shall come to pass , that the glory of jacob shall be make thin , and the fatness of he flesh shall wax lean .
and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn , and reapeth the ear with he arm ; and it shall be as he that gathereth ear in the valley of rephaim .
yet glean grape shall be leave in it , as the shake of a olive tree , two or three berry in the top of the uppermost bough , four or five in the outmost fruitful branch thereof , saith the lord god of israel .
at that day shall a man look to he maker , and he eye shall have respect to the holy one of israel .
and he shall not look to the altar , the work of he hand , neither shall respect that which he finger have make , either the grove , or the image .
in that day shall he strong city be as a forsake bough , and a uppermost branch , which they leave because of the child of israel : and there shall be desolation .
because thou hast forget the god of thy salvation , and hast not be mindful of the rock of thy strength , therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plant , and shalt set it with strange slip :
in the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow , and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish : but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
woe to the multitude of many people , which make a noise like the noise of the sea ; and to the rush of nation , that make a rush like the rush of mighty water !
the nation shall rush like the rush of many water : but god shall rebuke they , and they shall flee far off , and shall be chase as the chaff of the mountain before the wind , and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind .
and behold at eveningtide trouble ; and before the morning he be not .
this be the portion of they that spoil we , and the lot of they that rob we .
woe to the land shadow with wing , which be beyond the river of ethiopia :
that sendeth ambassador by the sea , even in vessel of bulrush upon the water , say , go , ye swift messenger , to a nation scatter and peel , to a people terrible from they beginning hitherto ; a nation mete out and trodden down , whose land the river have spoil !
all ye inhabitant of the world , and dweller on the earth , see ye , when he lifteth up a ensign on the mountain ; and when he bloweth a trumpet , hear ye .
for so the lord say unto i , i will take my rest , and i will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herb , and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest .
for afore the harvest , when the bud be perfect , and the sour grape be ripen in the flower , he shall both cut off the sprig with pruning hook , and take away and cut down the branch .
they shall be leave together unto the fowl of the mountain , and to the beast of the earth : and the fowl shall summer upon they , and all the beast of the earth shall winter upon they .
in that time shall the present be bring unto the lord of host of a people scatter and peel , and from a people terrible from they beginning hitherto ; a nation mete out and trodden under foot , whose land the river have spoil , to the place of the name of the lord of host , the mount zion .
the burden of egypt .
behold , the lord rideth upon a swift cloud , and shall come into egypt : and the idol of egypt shall be move at he presence , and the heart of egypt shall melt in the midst of it .
and i will set the egyptians against the egyptians : and they shall fight every one against he brother , and every one against he neighbour ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst thereof ; and i will destroy the counsel thereof : and they shall seek to the idol , and to the charmer , and to they that have familiar spirit , and to the wizard .
and the egyptians will i give over into the hand of a cruel lord ; and a fierce king shall rule over they , saith the lord , the lord of host .
and the water shall fail from the sea , and the river shall be waste and dry up .
and they shall turn the river far away ; and the brook of defence shall be empty and dry up : the reed and flag shall wither .
the paper reed by the brook , by the mouth of the brook , and every thing sow by the brook , shall wither , be drive away , and be no more .
the fisher also shall mourn , and all they that cast angle into the brook shall lament , and they that spread net upon the water shall languish .
moreover they that work in fine flax , and they that weave network , shall be confound .
and they shall be break in the purpose thereof , all that make sluice and pond for fish .
surely the prince of zoan be fool , the counsel of the wise counsellor of pharaoh be become brutish : how say ye unto pharaoh , i be the son of the wise , the son of ancient king ?
where be they ? where be thy wise man ? and let they tell thee now , and let they know what the lord of host have purpose upon egypt .
the prince of zoan be become fool , the prince of noph be deceive ; they have also seduce egypt , even they that be the stay of the tribe thereof .
the lord have mingle a perverse spirit in the midst thereof : and they have cause egypt to err in every work thereof , as a drunken man staggereth in he vomit .
neither shall there be any work for egypt , which the head or tail , branch or rush , may do .
in that day shall egypt be like unto woman : and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shake of the hand of the lord of host , which he shaketh over it .
and the land of judah shall be a terror unto egypt , every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself , because of the counsel of the lord of host , which he have determine against it .
in that day shall five city in the land of egypt speak the language of canaan , and swear to the lord of host ; one shall be call , the city of destruction .
in that day shall there be a altar to the lord in the midst of the land of egypt , and a pillar at the border thereof to the lord .
and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord of host in the land of egypt : for they shall cry unto the lord because of the oppressor , and he shall send they a saviour , and a great one , and he shall deliver they .
and the lord shall be know to egypt , and the egyptians shall know the lord in that day , and shall do sacrifice and oblation ; yea , they shall vow a vow unto the lord , and perform it .
and the lord shall smite egypt : he shall smite and heal it : and they shall return even to the lord , and he shall be intreat of they , and shall heal they .
in that day shall there be a highway out of egypt to assyria , and the assyrian shall come into egypt , and the egyptian into assyria , and the egyptians shall serve with the assyrians .
in that day shall israel be the third with egypt and with assyria , even a blessing in the midst of the land :
whom the lord of host shall bless , say , bless be egypt my people , and assyria the work of my hand , and israel mine inheritance .
in the year that tartan come unto ashdod , ( when sargon the king of assyria send he , ) and fight against ashdod , and take it ;
at the same time speak the lord by isaiah the son of amoz , say , go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loin , and put off thy shoe from thy foot .
and he do so , walk naked and barefoot .
and the lord say , like as my servant isaiah have walk naked and barefoot three year for a sign and wonder upon egypt and upon ethiopia ;
so shall the king of assyria lead away the egyptians prisoner , and the ethiopians captive , young and old , naked and barefoot , even with they buttock uncover , to the shame of egypt .
and they shall be afraid and ashamed of ethiopia they expectation , and of egypt they glory .
and the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day , behold , such be we expectation , whither we flee for help to be deliver from the king of assyria : and how shall we escape ?
the burden of the desert of the sea .
as whirlwind in the south pass through ; so it cometh from the desert , from a terrible land .
a grievous vision be declare unto i ; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously , and the spoiler spoileth .
go up , o elam : besiege , o media ; all the sigh thereof have i make to cease .
therefore be my loin fill with pain : pang have take hold upon i , as the pang of a woman that travaileth : i be bow down at the hearing of it ; i be dismay at the see of it .
my heart pant , fearfulness affright i : the night of my pleasure have he turn into fear unto i .
prepare the table , watch in the watchtower , eat , drink : arise , ye prince , and anoint the shield .
for thus have the lord say unto i , go , set a watchman , let he declare what he seeth .
and he see a chariot with a couple of horseman , a chariot of ass , and a chariot of camel ; and he hearken diligently with much heed :
and he cry , a lion : my lord , i stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime , and i be set in my ward whole night :
and , behold , here cometh a chariot of man , with a couple of horseman .
and he answer and say , babylon be fall , be fall ; and all the graven image of she god he have broken unto the ground .
o my threshing , and the corn of my floor : that which i have hear of the lord of host , the god of israel , have i declare unto you .
the burden of dumah .
he calleth to i out of seir , watchman , what of the night ?
watchman , what of the night ?
the watchman say , the morning cometh , and also the night : if ye will enquire , enquire ye : return , come .
the burden upon arabia .
in the forest in arabia shall ye lodge , o ye travel company of dedanim .
the inhabitant of the land of tema bring water to he that be thirsty , they prevent with they bread he that flee .
for they flee from the sword , from the draw sword , and from the bent bow , and from the grievousness of war .
for thus have the lord say unto i , within a year , accord to the year of a hireling , and all the glory of kedar shall fail :
and the residue of the number of archer , the mighty man of the child of kedar , shall be diminish : for the lord god of israel have speak it .
the burden of the valley of vision .
what aileth thee now , that thou art wholly go up to the housetops ?
thou that art full of stir , a tumultuous city , a joyous city : thy slay man be not slay with the sword , nor dead in battle .
all thy ruler be flee together , they be bind by the archer : all that be find in thee be bind together , which have flee from far .
therefore say i , look away from i ; i will weep bitterly , labour not to comfort i , because of the spoil of the daughter of my people .
for it be a day of trouble , and of tread down , and of perplexity by the lord god of host in the valley of vision , break down the wall , and of cry to the mountain .
and elam bare the quiver with chariot of man and horseman , and kir uncover the shield .
and it shall come to pass , that thy choicest valley shall be full of chariot , and the horseman shall set themselves in array at the gate .
and he discover the covering of judah , and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest .
ye have see also the breach of the city of david , that they be many : and ye gather together the water of the lower pool .
and ye have number the house of jerusalem , and the house have ye break down to fortify the wall .
ye make also a ditch between the two wall for the water of the old pool : but ye have not look unto the maker thereof , neither have respect unto he that fashion it long ago .
and in that day do the lord god of host call to weep , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to gird with sackcloth :
and behold joy and gladness , slaying ox , and kill sheep , eat flesh , and drinking wine : let we eat and drink ; for to morrow we shall die .
and it be reveal in mine ear by the lord of host , surely this iniquity shall not be purge from you till ye die , saith the lord god of host .
thus saith the lord god of host , go , get thee unto this treasurer , even unto shebna , which be over the house , and say ,
what hast thou here ? and whom hast thou here , that thou hast hew thee out a sepulchre here , as he that heweth he out a sepulchre on high , and that graveth a habitation for himself in a rock ?
behold , the lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity , and will surely cover thee .
he will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country : there shalt thou die , and there the chariot of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord 's house .
and i will drive thee from thy station , and from thy state shall he pull thee down .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that i will call my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah :
and i will clothe he with thy robe , and strengthen he with thy girdle , and i will commit thy government into he hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitant of jerusalem , and to the house of judah .
and the key of the house of david will i lay upon he shoulder ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
and i will fasten he as a nail in a sure place ; and he shall be for a glorious throne to he father 's house .
and they shall hang upon he all the glory of he father 's house , the offspring and the issue , all vessel of small quantity , from the vessel of cup , even to all the vessel of flagon .
in that day , saith the lord of host , shall the nail that be fasten in the sure place be remove , and be cut down , and fall ; and the burden that be upon it shall be cut off : for the lord have speak it .
the burden of tyre .
howl , ye ship of tarshish ; for it be lay waste , so that there be no house , no enter in : from the land of chittim it be reveal to they .
be still , ye inhabitant of the isle ; thou whom the merchant of zidon , that pass over the sea , have replenish .
and by great water the seed of sihor , the harvest of the river , be she revenue ; and she be a mart of nation .
be thou ashamed , o zidon : for the sea have speak , even the strength of the sea , say , i travail not , nor bring forth child , neither do i nourish up young man , nor bring up virgin .
as at the report concern egypt , so shall they be sorely pained at the report of tyre .
pass ye over to tarshish ; howl , ye inhabitant of the isle .
be this you joyous city , whose antiquity be of ancient day ? she own foot shall carry she afar off to sojourn .
who have take this counsel against tyre , the crowning city , whose merchant be prince , whose trafficker be the honourable of the earth ?
the lord of host have purpose it , to stain the pride of all glory , and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth .
pass through thy land as a river , o daughter of tarshish : there be no more strength .
he stretch out he hand over the sea , he shake the kingdom : the lord have give a commandment against the merchant city , to destroy the strong hold thereof .
and he say , thou shalt no more rejoice , o thou oppressed virgin , daughter of zidon : arise , pass over to chittim ; there also shalt thou have no rest .
behold the land of the chaldeans ; this people be not , till the assyrian found it for they that dwell in the wilderness : they set up the tower thereof , they raise up the palace thereof ; and he bring it to ruin .
howl , ye ship of tarshish : for you strength be lay waste .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that tyre shall be forget seventy year , accord to the day of one king : after the end of seventy year shall tyre sing as a harlot .
take a harp , go about the city , thou harlot that hast be forget ; make sweet melody , sing many song , that thou mayest be remember .
and it shall come to pass after the end of seventy year , that the lord will visit tyre , and she shall turn to she hire , and shall commit fornication with all the kingdom of the world upon the face of the earth .
and she merchandise and she hire shall be holiness to the lord : it shall not be treasured nor lay up ; for she merchandise shall be for they that dwell before the lord , to eat sufficiently , and for durable clothing .
behold , the lord maketh the earth empty , and maketh it waste , and turneth it upside down , and scattereth abroad the inhabitant thereof .
and it shall be , as with the people , so with the priest ; as with the servant , so with he master ; as with the maid , so with she mistress ; as with the buyer , so with the seller ; as with the lender , so with the borrower ; as with the taker of usury , so with the giver of usury to he .
the land shall be utterly empty , and utterly spoil : for the lord have speak this word .
the earth mourneth and fadeth away , the world languisheth and fadeth away , the haughty people of the earth do languish .
the earth also be defile under the inhabitant thereof ; because they have transgress the law , change the ordinance , break the everlasting covenant .
therefore have the curse devour the earth , and they that dwell therein be desolate : therefore the inhabitant of the earth be burn , and few man leave .
the new wine mourneth , the vine languisheth , all the merryheart do sigh .
the mirth of tabret ceaseth , the noise of they that rejoice endeth , the joy of the harp ceaseth .
they shall not drink wine with a song ; strong drink shall be bitter to they that drink it .
the city of confusion be break down : every house be shut up , that no man may come in .
there be a cry for wine in the street ; all joy be darken , the mirth of the land be go .
in the city be leave desolation , and the gate be smite with destruction .
when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people , there shall be as the shake of a olive tree , and as the glean grape when the vintage be do .
they shall lift up they voice , they shall sing for the majesty of the lord , they shall cry aloud from the sea .
wherefore glorify ye the lord in the fire , even the name of the lord god of israel in the isle of the sea .
from the uttermost part of the earth have we hear song , even glory to the righteous .
but i say , my leanness , my leanness , woe unto i ! the treacherous dealer have deal treacherously ; yea , the treacherous dealer have deal very treacherously .
fear , and the pit , and the snare , be upon thee , o inhabitant of the earth .
and it shall come to pass , that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be take in the snare : for the window from on high be open , and the foundation of the earth do shake .
the earth be utterly break down , the earth be clean dissolve , the earth be move exceedingly .
the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard , and shall be remove like a cottage ; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the lord shall punish the host of the high one that be on high , and the king of the earth upon the earth .
and they shall be gather together , as prisoner be gather in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many day shall they be visit .
then the moon shall be confound , and the sun ashamed , when the lord of host shall reign in mount zion , and in jerusalem , and before he ancient gloriously .
o lord , thou art my god ; i will exalt thee , i will praise thy name ; for thou hast do wonderful thing ; thy counsel of old be faithfulness and truth .
for thou hast make of a city a heap ; of a defenced city a ruin : a palace of stranger to be no city ; it shall never be build .
therefore shall the strong people glorify thee , the city of the terrible nation shall fear thee .
for thou hast be a strength to the poor , a strength to the needy in he distress , a refuge from the storm , a shadow from the heat , when the blast of the terrible one be as a storm against the wall .
thou shalt bring down the noise of stranger , as the heat in a dry place ; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud : the branch of the terrible one shall be bring low .
and in this mountain shall the lord of host make unto all people a feast of fat thing , a feast of wine on the lees , of fat thing full of marrow , of wine on the lees well refine .
and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the cover cast over all people , and the vail that be spread over all nation .
he will swallow up death in victory ; and the lord god will wipe away tear from off all face ; and the rebuke of he people shall he take away from off all the earth : for the lord have speak it .
and it shall be say in that day , lo , this be we god ; we have wait for he , and he will save we : this be the lord ; we have wait for he , we will be glad and rejoice in he salvation .
for in this mountain shall the hand of the lord rest , and moab shall be trodden down under he , even as straw be trodden down for the dunghill .
and he shall spread forth he hand in the midst of they , as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth he hand to swim : and he shall bring down they pride together with the spoil of they hand .
and the fortress of the high fort of thy wall shall he bring down , lay low , and bring to the ground , even to the dust .
in that day shall this song be sing in the land of judah ; we have a strong city ; salvation will god appoint for wall and bulwark .
open ye the gate , that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in .
thou wilt keep he in perfect peace , whose mind be stay on thee : because he trusteth in thee .
trust ye in the lord for ever : for in the lord jehovah be everlasting strength :
for he bringeth down they that dwell on high ; the lofty city , he layeth it low ; he layeth it low , even to the ground ; he bringeth it even to the dust .
the foot shall tread it down , even the foot of the poor , and the step of the needy .
the way of the just be uprightness : thou , most upright , dost weigh the path of the just .
yea , in the way of thy judgment , o lord , have we wait for thee ; the desire of we soul be to thy name , and to the remembrance of thee .
with my soul have i desire thee in the night ; yea , with my spirit within i will i seek thee early : for when thy judgment be in the earth , the inhabitant of the world will learn righteousness .
let favour be shew to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness : in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly , and will not behold the majesty of the lord .
lord , when thy hand be lift up , they will not see : but they shall see , and be ashamed for they envy at the people ; yea , the fire of thine enemy shall devour they .
lord , thou wilt ordain peace for we : for thou also hast work all we work in we .
o lord we god , other lord beside thee have have dominion over we : but by thee only will we make mention of thy name .
they be dead , they shall not live ; they be decease , they shall not rise : therefore hast thou visit and destroy they , and make all they memory to perish .
thou hast increase the nation , o lord , thou hast increase the nation : thou art glorified : thou hadst remove it far unto all the end of the earth .
lord , in trouble have they visit thee , they pour out a prayer when thy chasten be upon they .
like as a woman with child , that draweth near the time of she delivery , be in pain , and crieth out in she pang ; so have we be in thy sight , o lord .
we have be with child , we have be in pain , we have as it be bring forth wind ; we have not work any deliverance in the earth ; neither have the inhabitant of the world fall .
thy dead man shall live , together with my dead body shall they arise .
awake and sing , ye that dwell in dust : for thy dew be as the dew of herb , and the earth shall cast out the dead .
come , my people , enter thou into thy chamber , and shut thy door about thee : hide thyself as it be for a little moment , until the indignation be overpass .
for , behold , the lord cometh out of he place to punish the inhabitant of the earth for they iniquity : the earth also shall disclose she blood , and shall no more cover she slay .
in that day the lord with he sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the pierce serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that be in the sea .
in that day sing ye unto she , a vineyard of red wine .
i the lord do keep it ; i will water it every moment : lest any hurt it , i will keep it night and day .
fury be not in i : who would set the brier and thorn against i in battle ?
i would go through they , i would burn they together .
or let he take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with i ; and he shall make peace with i .
he shall cause they that come of jacob to take root : israel shall blossom and bud , and fill the face of the world with fruit .
hath he smite he , as he smite those that smite he ? or be he slay accord to the slaughter of they that be slay by he ?
in measure , when it shooteth forth , thou wilt debate with it : he stayeth he rough wind in the day of the east wind .
by this therefore shall the iniquity of jacob be purge ; and this be all the fruit to take away he sin ; when he maketh all the stone of the altar as chalkstone that be beat in sunder , the grove and image shall not stand up .
yet the defenced city shall be desolate , and the habitation forsake , and leave like a wilderness : there shall the calf feed , and there shall he lie down , and consume the branch thereof .
when the bough thereof be wither , they shall be break off : the woman come , and set they on fire : for it be a people of no understanding : therefore he that make they will not have mercy on they , and he that form they will shew they no favour .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt , and ye shall be gather one by one , o ye child of israel .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the great trumpet shall be blow , and they shall come which be ready to perish in the land of assyria , and the outcast in the land of egypt , and shall worship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem .
woe to the crown of pride , to the drunkard of ephraim , whose glorious beauty be a fading flower , which be on the head of the fat valley of they that be overcome with wine !
behold , the lord have a mighty and strong one , which as a tempest of hail and a destroy storm , as a flood of mighty water overflow , shall cast down to the earth with the hand .
the crown of pride , the drunkard of ephraim , shall be trodden under foot :
and the glorious beauty , which be on the head of the fat valley , shall be a fading flower , and as the hasty fruit before the summer ; which when he that looketh upon it seeth , while it be yet in he hand he eateth it up .
in that day shall the lord of host be for a crown of glory , and for a diadem of beauty , unto the residue of he people ,
and for a spirit of judgment to he that sitteth in judgment , and for strength to they that turn the battle to the gate .
but they also have err through wine , and through strong drink be out of the way ; the priest and the prophet have err through strong drink , they be swallow up of wine , they be out of the way through strong drink ; they err in vision , they stumble in judgment .
for all table be full of vomit and filthiness , so that there be no place clean .
whom shall he teach knowledge ? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine ? they that be wean from the milk , and draw from the breast .
for precept must be upon precept , precept upon precept ; line upon line , line upon line ; here a little , and there a little :
for with stammer lip and another tongue will he speak to this people .
to whom he say , this be the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest ; and this be the refreshing : yet they would not hear .
but the word of the lord be unto they precept upon precept , precept upon precept ; line upon line , line upon line ; here a little , and there a little ; that they might go , and fall backward , and be break , and snare , and take .
wherefore hear the word of the lord , ye scornful man , that rule this people which be in jerusalem .
because ye have say , we have make a covenant with death , and with hell be we at agreement ; when the overflow scourge shall pass through , it shall not come unto we : for we have make lie we refuge , and under falsehood have we hide ourselves :
therefore thus saith the lord god , behold , i lay in zion for a foundation a stone , a try stone , a precious corner stone , a sure foundation : he that believeth shall not make haste .
judgment also will i lay to the line , and righteousness to the plummet : and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lie , and the water shall overflow the hiding place .
and you covenant with death shall be disannull , and you agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the overflow scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be trodden down by it .
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report .
for the bed be shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the cover narrower than that he can wrap himself in it .
for the lord shall rise up as in mount perazim , he shall be wroth as in the valley of gibeon , that he may do he work , he strange work ; and bring to pass he act , he strange act .
now therefore be ye not mocker , lest you band be make strong : for i have hear from the lord god of host a consumption , even determine upon the whole earth .
give ye ear , and hear my voice ; hearken , and hear my speech .
doth the plowman plow all day to sow ? doth he open and break the clod of he ground ?
when he have make plain the face thereof , doth he not cast abroad the fitch , and scatter the cummin , and cast in the principal wheat and the appoint barley and the rie in they place ?
for he god doth instruct he to discretion , and doth teach he .
for the fitch be not thresh with a threshing instrument , neither be a cart wheel turn about upon the cummin ; but the fitch be beat out with a staff , and the cummin with a rod .
bread corn be bruise ; because he will not ever be thresh it , nor break it with the wheel of he cart , nor bruise it with he horseman .
this also cometh forth from the lord of host , which be wonderful in counsel , and excellent in work .
woe to ariel , to ariel , the city where david dwelt ! add ye year to year ; let they kill sacrifice .
yet i will distress ariel , and there shall be heaviness and sorrow : and it shall be unto i as ariel .
and i will camp against thee round about , and will lay siege against thee with a mount , and i will raise fort against thee .
and thou shalt be bring down , and shalt speak out of the ground , and thy speech shall be low out of the dust , and thy voice shall be , as of one that have a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust .
moreover the multitude of thy stranger shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible one shall be as chaff that passeth away : yea , it shall be at a instant suddenly .
thou shalt be visit of the lord of host with thunder , and with earthquake , and great noise , with storm and tempest , and the flame of devour fire .
and the multitude of all the nation that fight against ariel , even all that fight against she and she munition , and that distress she , shall be as a dream of a night vision .
it shall even be as when a hungry man dreameth , and , behold , he eateth ; but he awaketh , and he soul be empty : or as when a thirsty man dreameth , and , behold , he drinketh ; but he awaketh , and , behold , he be faint , and he soul have appetite : so shall the multitude of all the nation be , that fight against mount zion .
stay yourselve , and wonder ; cry ye out , and cry : they be drunken , but not with wine ; they stagger , but not with strong drink .
for the lord have pour out upon you the spirit of deep sleep , and have closed you eye : the prophet and you ruler , the seer have he cover .
and the vision of all be become unto you as the word of a book that be seal , which man deliver to one that be learn , say , read this , i pray thee : and he saith , i can not ; for it be seal :
and the book be deliver to he that be not learn , say , read this , i pray thee : and he saith , i be not learn .
wherefore the lord say , forasmuch as this people draw near i with they mouth , and with they lip do honour i , but have remove they heart far from i , and they fear toward i be teach by the precept of man :
therefore , behold , i will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people , even a marvellous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of they wise man shall perish , and the understanding of they prudent man shall be hide .
woe unto they that seek deep to hide they counsel from the lord , and they work be in the dark , and they say , who seeth we ? and who knoweth we ?
surely you turning of thing upside down shall be esteem as the potter 's clay : for shall the work say of he that make it , he make i not ? or shall the thing frame say of he that frame it , he have no understanding ?
be it not yet a very little while , and lebanon shall be turn into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteem as a forest ?
and in that day shall the deaf hear the word of the book , and the eye of the blind shall see out of obscurity , and out of darkness .
the meek also shall increase they joy in the lord , and the poor among man shall rejoice in the holy one of israel .
for the terrible one be bring to nought , and the scorner be consume , and all that watch for iniquity be cut off :
that make a man a offender for a word , and lay a snare for he that reproveth in the gate , and turn aside the just for a thing of nought .
therefore thus saith the lord , who redeem abraham , concern the house of jacob , jacob shall not now be ashamed , neither shall he face now wax pale .
but when he seeth he child , the work of mine hand , in the midst of he , they shall sanctify my name , and sanctify the holy one of jacob , and shall fear the god of israel .
they also that err in spirit shall come to understanding , and they that murmured shall learn doctrine .
woe to the rebellious child , saith the lord , that take counsel , but not of i ; and that cover with a cover , but not of my spirit , that they may add sin to sin :
that walk to go down into egypt , and have not ask at my mouth ; to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh , and to trust in the shadow of egypt !
therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be you shame , and the trust in the shadow of egypt you confusion .
for he prince be at zoan , and he ambassador come to hanes .
they be all ashamed of a people that could not profit they , nor be a help nor profit , but a shame , and also a reproach .
the burden of the beast of the south : into the land of trouble and anguish , from whence come the young and old lion , the viper and fiery fly serpent , they will carry they riches upon the shoulder of young ass , and they treasure upon the bunch of camel , to a people that shall not profit they .
for the egyptians shall help in vain , and to no purpose : therefore have i cry concern this , they strength be to sit still .
now go , write it before they in a table , and note it in a book , that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever :
that this be a rebellious people , lie child , child that will not hear the law of the lord :
which say to the seer , see not ; and to the prophet , prophesy not unto we right thing , speak unto we smooth thing , prophesy deceit :
get you out of the way , turn aside out of the path , cause the holy one of israel to cease from before we .
wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel , because ye despise this word , and trust in oppression and perverseness , and stay thereon :
therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall , swell out in a high wall , whose breaking cometh suddenly at a instant .
and he shall break it as the breaking of the potter ' vessel that be break in piece ; he shall not spare : so that there shall not be find in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth , or to take water withal out of the pit .
for thus saith the lord god , the holy one of israel ; in return and rest shall ye be save ; in quietness and in confidence shall be you strength : and ye would not .
but ye say , no ; for we will flee upon horse ; therefore shall ye flee : and , we will ride upon the swift ; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift .
one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one ; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee : till ye be leave as a beacon upon the top of a mountain , and as a ensign on a hill .
and therefore will the lord wait , that he may be gracious unto you , and therefore will he be exalt , that he may have mercy upon you : for the lord be a god of judgment : bless be all they that wait for he .
for the people shall dwell in zion at jerusalem : thou shalt weep no more : he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer thee .
and though the lord give you the bread of adversity , and the water of affliction , yet shall not thy teacher be remove into a corner any more , but thine eye shall see thy teacher :
and thine ear shall hear a word behind thee , say , this be the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
ye shall defile also the cover of thy graven image of silver , and the ornament of thy molten image of gold : thou shalt cast they away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , get thee hence .
then shall he give the rain of thy seed , that thou shalt sow the ground withal ; and bread of the increase of the earth , and it shall be fat and plenteous : in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pasture .
the oxen likewise and the young ass that ear the ground shall eat clean provender , which have be winnow with the shovel and with the fan .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , river and stream of water in the day of the great slaughter , when the tower fall .
moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold , as the light of seven day , in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of he people , and healeth the stroke of they wound .
behold , the name of the lord cometh from far , burn with he anger , and the burden thereof be heavy : he lip be full of indignation , and he tongue as a devour fire :
and he breath , as a overflow stream , shall reach to the midst of the neck , to sift the nation with the sieve of vanity : and there shall be a bridle in the jaw of the people , cause they to err .
ye shall have a song , as in the night when a holy solemnity be keep ; and gladness of heart , as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the lord , to the mighty one of israel .
and the lord shall cause he glorious voice to be hear , and shall shew the lighting down of he arm , with the indignation of he anger , and with the flame of a devour fire , with scattering , and tempest , and hailstone .
for through the voice of the lord shall the assyrian be beat down , which smite with a rod .
and in every place where the ground staff shall pass , which the lord shall lay upon he , it shall be with tabret and harp : and in battle of shake will he fight with it .
for tophet be ordain of old ; yea , for the king it be prepare ; he have make it deep and large : the pile thereof be fire and much wood ; the breath of the lord , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it .
woe to they that go down to egypt for help ; and stay on horse , and trust in chariot , because they be many ; and in horseman , because they be very strong ; but they look not unto the holy one of israel , neither seek the lord !
yet he also be wise , and will bring evil , and will not call back he word : but will arise against the house of the evildoer , and against the help of they that work iniquity .
now the egyptians be man , and not god ; and they horse flesh , and not spirit .
when the lord shall stretch out he hand , both he that helpeth shall fall , and he that be holpen shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .
for thus have the lord speak unto i , like as the lion and the young lion roar on he prey , when a multitude of shepherd be call forth against he , he will not be afraid of they voice , nor abase himself for the noise of they : so shall the lord of host come down to fight for mount zion , and for the hill thereof .
as bird fly , so will the lord of host defend jerusalem ; defend also he will deliver it ; and pass over he will preserve it .
turn ye unto he from whom the child of israel have deeply revolt .
for in that day every man shall cast away he idol of silver , and he idol of gold , which you own hand have make unto you for a sin .
then shall the assyrian fall with the sword , not of a mighty man ; and the sword , not of a mean man , shall devour he : but he shall flee from the sword , and he young man shall be discomfited .
and he shall pass over to he strong hold for fear , and he prince shall be afraid of the ensign , saith the lord , whose fire be in zion , and he furnace in jerusalem .
behold , a king shall reign in righteousness , and prince shall rule in judgment .
and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest ; as river of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
and the eye of they that see shall not be dim , and the ear of they that hear shall hearken .
the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerer shall be ready to speak plainly .
the vile person shall be no more call liberal , nor the churl say to be bountiful .
for the vile person will speak villany , and he heart will work iniquity , to practise hypocrisy , and to utter error against the lord , to make empty the soul of the hungry , and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail .
the instrument also of the churl be evil : he deviseth wicked device to destroy the poor with lie word , even when the needy speaketh right .
but the liberal deviseth liberal thing ; and by liberal thing shall he stand .
rise up , ye woman that be at ease ; hear my voice , ye careless daughter ; give ear unto my speech .
many day and year shall ye be trouble , ye careless woman : for the vintage shall fail , the gathering shall not come .
tremble , ye woman that be at ease ; be trouble , ye careless one : strip you , and make you bare , and gird sackcloth upon you loin .
they shall lament for the teat , for the pleasant field , for the fruitful vine .
upon the land of my people shall come up thorn and brier ; yea , upon all the house of joy in the joyous city :
because the palace shall be forsake ; the multitude of the city shall be leave ; the fort and tower shall be for den for ever , a joy of wild ass , a pasture of flock ;
until the spirit be pour upon we from on high , and the wilderness be a fruitful field , and the fruitful field be count for a forest .
then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness , and righteousness remain in the fruitful field .
and the work of righteousness shall be peace ; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever .
and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation , and in sure dwelling , and in quiet rest place ;
when it shall hail , come down on the forest ; and the city shall be low in a low place .
bless be ye that sow beside all water , that send forth thither the foot of the ox and the ass .
woe to thee that spoilest , and thou wast not spoil ; and dealest treacherously , and they deal not treacherously with thee ! when thou shalt cease to spoil , thou shalt be spoil ; and when thou shalt make a end to deal treacherously , they shall deal treacherously with thee .
o lord , be gracious unto we ; we have wait for thee : be thou they arm every morning , we salvation also in the time of trouble .
at the noise of the tumult the people flee ; at the lift up of thyself the nation be scatter .
and you spoil shall be gather like the gathering of the caterpiller : as the run to and fro of locust shall he run upon they .
the lord be exalt ; for he dwelleth on high : he have fill zion with judgment and righteousness .
and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy time , and strength of salvation : the fear of the lord be he treasure .
behold , they valiant one shall cry without : the ambassador of peace shall weep bitterly .
the highway lie waste , the wayfaring man ceaseth : he have break the covenant , he have despise the city , he regardeth no man .
the earth mourneth and languisheth : lebanon be ashamed and hew down : sharon be like a wilderness ; and bashan and carmel shake off they fruit .
now will i rise , saith the lord ; now will i be exalt ; now will i lift up myself .
ye shall conceive chaff , ye shall bring forth stubble : you breath , as fire , shall devour you .
and the people shall be as the burning of lime : as thorn cut up shall they be burn in the fire .
hear , ye that be far off , what i have do ; and , ye that be near , acknowledge my might .
the sinner in zion be afraid ; fearfulness have surprised the hypocrite .
who among we shall dwell with the devour fire ? who among we shall dwell with everlasting burning ?
he that walketh righteously , and speaketh uprightly ; he that despiseth the gain of oppression , that shaketh he hand from holding of bribe , that stoppeth he ear from hearing of blood , and shutteth he eye from see evil ;
he shall dwell on high : he place of defence shall be the munitions of rock : bread shall be give he ; he water shall be sure .
thine eye shall see the king in he beauty : they shall behold the land that be very far off .
thine heart shall meditate terror .
where be the scribe ? where be the receiver ? where be he that count the tower ?
thou shalt not see a fierce people , a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive ; of a stammer tongue , that thou canst not understand .
look upon zion , the city of we solemnity : thine eye shall see jerusalem a quiet habitation , a tabernacle that shall not be take down ; not one of the stake thereof shall ever be remove , neither shall any of the cord thereof be break .
but there the glorious lord will be unto we a place of broad river and stream ; wherein shall go no galley with oar , neither shall gallant ship pass thereby .
for the lord be we judge , the lord be we lawgiver , the lord be we king ; he will save we .
thy tackling be loose ; they could not well strengthen they mast , they could not spread the sail : then be the prey of a great spoil divide ; the lame take the prey .
and the inhabitant shall not say , i be sick : the people that dwell therein shall be forgive they iniquity .
come near , ye nation , to hear ; and hearken , ye people : let the earth hear , and all that be therein ; the world , and all thing that come forth of it .
for the indignation of the lord be upon all nation , and he fury upon all they army : he have utterly destroy they , he have deliver they to the slaughter .
they slay also shall be cast out , and they stink shall come up out of they carcase , and the mountain shall be melt with they blood .
and all the host of heaven shall be dissolve , and the heaven shall be roll together as a scroll : and all they host shall fall down , as the leaf falleth off from the vine , and as a fall fig from the fig tree .
for my sword shall be bath in heaven : behold , it shall come down upon idumea , and upon the people of my curse , to judgment .
the sword of the lord be fill with blood , it be make fat with fatness , and with the blood of lamb and goat , with the fat of the kidney of ram : for the lord have a sacrifice in bozrah , and a great slaughter in the land of idumea .
and the unicorn shall come down with they , and the bullock with the bull ; and they land shall be soak with blood , and they dust make fat with fatness .
for it be the day of the lord 's vengeance , and the year of recompence for the controversy of zion .
and the stream thereof shall be turn into pitch , and the dust thereof into brimstone , and the land thereof shall become burn pitch .
it shall not be quench night nor day ; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it ; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it : and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion , and the stone of emptiness .
they shall call the noble thereof to the kingdom , but none shall be there , and all she prince shall be nothing .
and thorn shall come up in she palace , nettle and bramble in the fortress thereof : and it shall be a habitation of dragon , and a court for owl .
the wild beast of the desert shall also meet with the wild beast of the island , and the satyr shall cry to he fellow ; the screech owl also shall rest there , and find for herself a place of rest .
there shall the great owl make she nest , and lay , and hatch , and gather under she shadow : there shall the vulture also be gather , every one with she mate .
seek ye out of the book of the lord , and read : no one of these shall fail , none shall want she mate : for my mouth it have command , and he spirit it have gather they .
and he have cast the lot for they , and he hand have divide it unto they by line : they shall possess it for ever , from generation to generation shall they dwell therein .
the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for they ; and the desert shall rejoice , and blossom as the rose .
it shall blossom abundantly , and rejoice even with joy and singing : the glory of lebanon shall be give unto it , the excellency of carmel and sharon , they shall see the glory of the lord , and the excellency of we god .
strengthen ye the weak hand , and confirm the feeble knee .
say to they that be of a fearful heart , be strong , fear not : behold , you god will come with vengeance , even god with a recompence ; he will come and save you .
then the eye of the blind shall be open , and the ear of the deaf shall be unstopped .
then shall the lame man leap as a hart , and the tongue of the dumb sing : for in the wilderness shall water break out , and stream in the desert .
and the parched ground shall become a pool , and the thirsty land spring of water : in the habitation of dragon , where each lay , shall be grass with reed and rush .
and a highway shall be there , and a way , and it shall be call the way of holiness ; the unclean shall not pass over it ; but it shall be for those : the wayfaring man , though fool , shall not err therein .
no lion shall be there , nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon , it shall not be find there ; but the redeem shall walk there :
and the ransom of the lord shall return , and come to zion with song and everlasting joy upon they head : they shall obtain joy and gladness , and sorrow and sigh shall flee away .
now it come to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah , that sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the defenced city of judah , and take they .
and the king of assyria send rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem unto king hezekiah with a great army .
and he stand by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller 's field .
then come forth unto he eliakim , hilkiah 's son , which be over the house , and shebna the scribe , and joah , asaph 's son , the recorder .
and rabshakeh say unto they , say ye now to hezekiah , thus saith the great king , the king of assyria , what confidence be this wherein thou trustest ?
i say , sayest thou , ( but they be but vain word ) i have counsel and strength for war : now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against i ?
lo , thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed , on egypt ; whereon if a man lean , it will go into he hand , and pierce it : so be pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in he .
but if thou say to i , we trust in the lord we god : be it not he , whose high place and whose altar hezekiah have take away , and say to judah and to jerusalem , ye shall worship before this altar ?
now therefore give pledge , i pray thee , to my master the king of assyria , and i will give thee two thousand horse , if thou be able on thy part to set rider upon they .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servant , and put thy trust on egypt for chariot and for horseman ?
and be i now come up without the lord against this land to destroy it ? the lord say unto i , go up against this land , and destroy it .
then say eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh , speak , i pray thee , unto thy servant in the syrian language ; for we understand it : and speak not to we in the jews ' language , in the ear of the people that be on the wall .
but rabshakeh say , hath my master send i to thy master and to thee to speak these word ? have he not send i to the man that sit upon the wall , that they may eat they own dung , and drink they own piss with you ?
then rabshakeh stand , and cry with a loud voice in the jews ' language , and say , hear ye the word of the great king , the king of assyria .
thus saith the king , let not hezekiah deceive you : for he shall not be able to deliver you .
neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord , say , the lord will surely deliver we : this city shall not be deliver into the hand of the king of assyria .
hearken not to hezekiah : for thus saith the king of assyria , make a agreement with i by a present , and come out to i : and eat ye every one of he vine , and every one of he fig tree , and drink ye every one the water of he own cistern ;
until i come and take you away to a land like you own land , a land of corn and wine , a land of bread and vineyard .
beware lest hezekiah persuade you , say , the lord will deliver we .
hath any of the god of the nation deliver he land out of the hand of the king of assyria ?
where be the god of hamath and arphad ? where be the god of sepharvaim ? and have they deliver samaria out of my hand ?
who be they among all the god of these land , that have deliver they land out of my hand , that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand ?
but they hold they peace , and answer he not a word : for the king 's commandment be , say , answer he not .
then come eliakim , the son of hilkiah , that be over the household , and shebna the scribe , and joah , the son of asaph , the recorder , to hezekiah with they clothes rent , and tell he the word of rabshakeh .
and it come to pass , when king hezekiah hear it , that he rent he clothes , and cover himself with sackcloth , and go into the house of the lord .
and he send eliakim , who be over the household , and shebna the scribe , and the elder of the priest cover with sackcloth , unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz .
and they say unto he , thus saith hezekiah , this day be a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and of blasphemy : for the child be come to the birth , and there be not strength to bring forth .
it may be the lord thy god will hear the word of rabshakeh , whom the king of assyria he master have send to reproach the living god , and will reprove the word which the lord thy god have hear : wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that be leave .
so the servant of king hezekiah come to isaiah .
and isaiah say unto they , thus shall ye say unto you master , thus saith the lord , be not afraid of the word that thou hast hear , wherewith the servant of the king of assyria have blaspheme i .
behold , i will send a blast upon he , and he shall hear a rumour , and return to he own land ; and i will cause he to fall by the sword in he own land .
so rabshakeh return , and find the king of assyria war against libnah : for he have hear that he be depart from lachish .
and he hear say concern tirhakah king of ethiopia , he be come forth to make war with thee .
and when he hear it , he send messenger to hezekiah , say ,
thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah , say , let not thy god , in whom thou trustest , deceive thee , say , jerusalem shall not be give into the hand of the king of assyria .
behold , thou hast hear what the king of assyria have do to all land by destroy they utterly ; and shalt thou be deliver ?
have the god of the nation deliver they which my father have destroy , as gozan , and haran , and rezeph , and the child of eden which be in telassar ?
where be the king of hamath , and the king of arphad , and the king of the city of sepharvaim , hena , and ivah ?
and hezekiah receive the letter from the hand of the messenger , and read it : and hezekiah go up unto the house of the lord , and spread it before the lord .
and hezekiah pray unto the lord , say ,
o lord of host , god of israel , that dwellest between the cherubim , thou art the god , even thou alone , of all the kingdom of the earth : thou hast make heaven and earth .
incline thine ear , o lord , and hear ; open thine eye , o lord , and see : and hear all the word of sennacherib , which have send to reproach the living god .
of a truth , lord , the king of assyria have lay waste all the nation , and they country ,
and have cast they god into the fire : for they be no god , but the work of man 's hand , wood and stone : therefore they have destroy they .
now therefore , o lord we god , save we from he hand , that all the kingdom of the earth may know that thou art the lord , even thou only .
then isaiah the son of amoz send unto hezekiah , say , thus saith the lord god of israel , whereas thou hast pray to i against sennacherib king of assyria :
this be the word which the lord have speak concern he ; the virgin , the daughter of zion , have despise thee , and laugh thee to scorn ; the daughter of jerusalem have shake she head at thee .
whom hast thou reproach and blaspheme ? and against whom hast thou exalt thy voice , and lift up thine eye on high ? even against the holy one of israel .
by thy servant hast thou reproach the lord , and hast say , by the multitude of my chariot be i come up to the height of the mountain , to the side of lebanon ; and i will cut down the tall cedar thereof , and the choice fir tree thereof : and i will enter into the height of he border , and the forest of he carmel .
i have dig , and drunk water ; and with the sole of my foot have i dry up all the river of the besiege place .
hast thou not hear long ago , how i have do it ; and of ancient time , that i have form it ? now have i bring it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced city into ruinous heap .
therefore they inhabitant be of small power , they be dismayed and confound : they be as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blast before it be grow up .
but i know thy abode , and thy go out , and thy come in , and thy rage against i .
because thy rage against i , and thy tumult , be come up into mine ear , therefore will i put my hook in thy nose , and my bridle in thy lip , and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself ; and the second year that which springeth of the same : and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyard , and eat the fruit thereof .
and the remnant that be escape of the house of judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward :
for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount zion : the zeal of the lord of host shall do this .
therefore thus saith the lord concern the king of assyria , he shall not come into this city , nor shoot a arrow there , nor come before it with shield , nor cast a bank against it .
by the way that he come , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the lord .
for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake , and for my servant david 's sake .
then the angel of the lord go forth , and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand : and when they arise early in the morning , behold , they be all dead corpse .
so sennacherib king of assyria depart , and go and return , and dwelt at nineveh .
and it come to pass , as he be worship in the house of nisroch he god , that adrammelech and sharezer he son smite he with the sword ; and they escape into the land of armenia : and esarhaddon he son reign in he stead .
in those day be hezekiah sick unto death .
and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz come unto he , and say unto he , thus saith the lord , set thine house in order : for thou shalt die , and not live .
then hezekiah turn he face toward the wall , and pray unto the lord ,
and say , remember now , o lord , i beseech thee , how i have walk before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have do that which be good in thy sight .
and hezekiah weep sore .
then come the word of the lord to isaiah , say ,
go , and say to hezekiah , thus saith the lord , the god of david thy father , i have hear thy prayer , i have see thy tear : behold , i will add unto thy day fifteen year .
and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria : and i will defend this city .
and this shall be a sign unto thee from the lord , that the lord will do this thing that he have speak ;
behold , i will bring again the shadow of the degree , which be go down in the sun dial of ahaz , ten degree backward .
so the sun return ten degree , by which degree it be go down .
the writing of hezekiah king of judah , when he have be sick , and be recover of he sickness :
i say in the cut off of my day , i shall go to the gate of the grave : i be deprive of the residue of my year .
i say , i shall not see the lord , even the lord , in the land of the living : i shall behold man no more with the inhabitant of the world .
mine age be depart , and be remove from i as a shepherd 's tent : i have cut off like a weaver my life : he will cut i off with pine sickness : from day even to night wilt thou make a end of i .
i reckon till morning , that , as a lion , so will he break all my bone : from day even to night wilt thou make a end of i .
like a crane or a swallow , so do i chatter : i do mourn as a dive : mine eye fail with look upward : o lord , i be oppress ; undertake for i .
what shall i say ? he have both speak unto i , and himself have do it : i shall go softly all my year in the bitterness of my soul .
o lord , by these thing man live , and in all these thing be the life of my spirit : so wilt thou recover i , and make i to live .
behold , for peace i have great bitterness : but thou hast in love to my soul deliver it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sin behind thy back .
for the grave can not praise thee , death can not celebrate thee : they that go down into the pit can not hope for thy truth .
the living , the living , he shall praise thee , as i do this day : the father to the child shall make known thy truth .
the lord be ready to save i : therefore we will sing my song to the stringed instrument all the day of we life in the house of the lord .
for isaiah have say , let they take a lump of fig , and lay it for a plaister upon the boil , and he shall recover .
hezekiah also have say , what be the sign that i shall go up to the house of the lord ?
at that time merodachbaladan , the son of baladan , king of babylon , send letter and a present to hezekiah : for he have hear that he have be sick , and be recover .
and hezekiah be glad of they , and shew they the house of he precious thing , the silver , and the gold , and the spice , and the precious ointment , and all the house of he armour , and all that be find in he treasure : there be nothing in he house , nor in all he dominion , that hezekiah shew they not .
then come isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah , and say unto he , what say these man ? and from whence come they unto thee ?
and hezekiah say , they be come from a far country unto i , even from babylon .
then say he , what have they see in thine house ?
and hezekiah answer , all that be in mine house have they see : there be nothing among my treasure that i have not shew they .
then say isaiah to hezekiah , hear the word of the lord of host :
behold , the day come , that all that be in thine house , and that which thy father have lay up in store until this day , shall be carry to babylon : nothing shall be leave , saith the lord .
and of thy son that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuch in the palace of the king of babylon .
then say hezekiah to isaiah , good be the word of the lord which thou hast speak .
he say moreover , for there shall be peace and truth in my day .
comfort ye , comfort ye my people , saith you god .
speak ye comfortably to jerusalem , and cry unto she , that she warfare be accomplish , that she iniquity be pardon : for she have receive of the lord 's hand double for all she sin .
the voice of he that crieth in the wilderness , prepare ye the way of the lord , make straight in the desert a highway for we god .
every valley shall be exalt , and every mountain and hill shall be make low : and the crooked shall be make straight , and the rough place plain :
and the glory of the lord shall be reveal , and all flesh shall see it together : for the mouth of the lord have speak it .
the voice say , cry .
and he say , what shall i cry ?
all flesh be grass , and all the goodliness thereof be as the flower of the field :
the grass withereth , the flower fadeth : because the spirit of the lord bloweth upon it : surely the people be grass .
the grass withereth , the flower fadeth : but the word of we god shall stand for ever .
o zion , that bringest good tiding , get thee up into the high mountain ; o jerusalem , that bringest good tiding , lift up thy voice with strength ; lift it up , be not afraid ; say unto the city of judah , behold you god !
behold , the lord god will come with strong hand , and he arm shall rule for he : behold , he reward be with he , and he work before he .
he shall feed he flock like a shepherd : he shall gather the lamb with he arm , and carry they in he bosom , and shall gently lead those that be with young .
who have measure the water in the hollow of he hand , and mete out heaven with the span , and comprehend the dust of the earth in a measure , and weigh the mountain in scale , and the hill in a balance ?
who have direct the spirit of the lord , or be he counsellor have teach he ?
with whom take he counsel , and who instruct he , and teach he in the path of judgment , and teach he knowledge , and shew to he the way of understand ?
behold , the nation be as a drop of a bucket , and be count as the small dust of the balance : behold , he taketh up the isle as a very little thing .
and lebanon be not sufficient to burn , nor the beast thereof sufficient for a burnt offering .
all nation before he be as nothing ; and they be count to he less than nothing , and vanity .
to whom then will ye liken god ? or what likeness will ye compare unto he ?
the workman melteth a graven image , and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold , and casteth silver chain .
he that be so impoverished that he have no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot ; he seeketh unto he a cunning workman to prepare a graven image , that shall not be move .
have ye not know ? have ye not hear ? have it not be tell you from the beginning ? have ye not understand from the foundation of the earth ?
it be he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitant thereof be as grasshopper ; that stretcheth out the heaven as a curtain , and spreadeth they out as a tent to dwell in :
that bringeth the prince to nothing ; he maketh the judge of the earth as vanity .
yea , they shall not be plant ; yea , they shall not be sow : yea , they stock shall not take root in the earth : and he shall also blow upon they , and they shall wither , and the whirlwind shall take they away as stubble .
to whom then will ye liken i , or shall i be equal ? saith the holy one .
lift up you eye on high , and behold who have create these thing , that bringeth out they host by number : he calleth they all by name by the greatness of he might , for that he be strong in power ; not one faileth .
why sayest thou , o jacob , and speakest , o israel , my way be hide from the lord , and my judgment be pass over from my god ?
hast thou not know ? hast thou not hear , that the everlasting god , the lord , the creator of the end of the earth , fainteth not , neither be weary ? there be no search of he understanding .
he giveth power to the faint ; and to they that have no might he increaseth strength .
even the youth shall faint and be weary , and the young man shall utterly fall :
but they that wait upon the lord shall renew they strength ; they shall mount up with wing as eagle ; they shall run , and not be weary ; and they shall walk , and not faint .
keep silence before i , o island ; and let the people renew they strength : let they come near ; then let they speak : let we come near together to judgment .
who raise up the righteous man from the east , call he to he foot , give the nation before he , and make he rule over king ? he give they as the dust to he sword , and as drive stubble to he bow .
he pursue they , and pass safely ; even by the way that he have not go with he foot .
who have work and do it , call the generation from the beginning ?
i the lord , the first , and with the last ; i be he .
the isle see it , and fear ; the end of the earth be afraid , draw near , and come .
they help every one he neighbour ; and every one say to he brother , be of good courage .
so the carpenter encourage the goldsmith , and he that smootheth with the hammer he that smite the anvil , say , it be ready for the sodering : and he fasten it with nail , that it should not be move .
but thou , israel , art my servant , jacob whom i have choose , the seed of abraham my friend .
thou whom i have take from the end of the earth , and call thee from the chief man thereof , and say unto thee , thou art my servant ; i have choose thee , and not cast thee away .
fear thou not ; for i be with thee : be not dismay ; for i be thy god : i will strengthen thee ; yea , i will help thee ; yea , i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness .
behold , all they that be incense against thee shall be ashamed and confound : they shall be as nothing ; and they that strive with thee shall perish .
thou shalt seek they , and shalt not find they , even they that contend with thee : they that war against thee shall be as nothing , and as a thing of nought .
for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand , say unto thee , fear not ; i will help thee .
fear not , thou worm jacob , and ye man of israel ; i will help thee , saith the lord , and thy redeemer , the holy one of israel .
behold , i will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument have tooth : thou shalt thresh the mountain , and beat they small , and shalt make the hill as chaff .
thou shalt fan they , and the wind shall carry they away , and the whirlwind shall scatter they : and thou shalt rejoice in the lord , and shalt glory in the holy one of israel .
when the poor and needy seek water , and there be none , and they tongue faileth for thirst , i the lord will hear they , i the god of israel will not forsake they .
i will open river in high place , and fountain in the midst of the valley : i will make the wilderness a pool of water , and the dry land spring of water .
i will plant in the wilderness the cedar , the shittah tree , and the myrtle , and the oil tree ; i will set in the desert the fir tree , and the pine , and the box tree together :
that they may see , and know , and consider , and understand together , that the hand of the lord have do this , and the holy one of israel have create it .
produce you cause , saith the lord ; bring forth you strong reason , saith the king of jacob .
let they bring they forth , and shew we what shall happen : let they shew the former thing , what they be , that we may consider they , and know the latter end of they ; or declare we thing for to come .
shew the thing that be to come hereafter , that we may know that ye be god : yea , do good , or do evil , that we may be dismayed , and behold it together .
behold , ye be of nothing , and you work of nought : a abomination be he that chooseth you .
i have raise up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon prince as upon morter , and as the potter treadeth clay .
who have declare from the beginning , that we may know ? and beforetime , that we may say , he be righteous ? yea , there be none that sheweth , yea , there be none that declareth , yea , there be none that heareth you word .
the first shall say to zion , behold , behold they : and i will give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tiding .
for i behold , and there be no man ; even among they , and there be no counsellor , that , when i ask of they , could answer a word .
behold , they be all vanity ; they work be nothing : they molten image be wind and confusion .
behold my servant , whom i uphold ; mine elect , in whom my soul delighteth ; i have put my spirit upon he : he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles .
he shall not cry , nor lift up , nor cause he voice to be hear in the street .
a bruised reed shall he not break , and the smoking flax shall he not quench : he shall bring forth judgment unto truth .
he shall not fail nor be discourage , till he have set judgment in the earth : and the isle shall wait for he law .
thus saith god the lord , he that create the heaven , and stretch they out ; he that spread forth the earth , and that which cometh out of it ; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it , and spirit to they that walk therein :
i the lord have call thee in righteousness , and will hold thine hand , and will keep thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , for a light of the gentiles ;
to open the blind eye , to bring out the prisoner from the prison , and they that sit in darkness out of the prison house .
i be the lord : that be my name : and my glory will i not give to another , neither my praise to grave image .
behold , the former thing be come to pass , and new thing do i declare : before they spring forth i tell you of they .
sing unto the lord a new song , and he praise from the end of the earth , ye that go down to the sea , and all that be therein ; the isle , and the inhabitant thereof .
let the wilderness and the city thereof lift up they voice , the village that kedar doth inhabit : let the inhabitant of the rock sing , let they shout from the top of the mountain .
let they give glory unto the lord , and declare he praise in the island .
the lord shall go forth as a mighty man , he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war : he shall cry , yea , roar ; he shall prevail against he enemy .
i have long time holden my peace ; i have be still , and refrain myself : now will i cry like a travailing woman ; i will destroy and devour at once .
i will make waste mountain and hill , and dry up all they herb ; and i will make the river island , and i will dry up the pool .
and i will bring the blind by a way that they know not ; i will lead they in path that they have not know : i will make darkness light before they , and crooked thing straight .
these thing will i do unto they , and not forsake they .
they shall be turn back , they shall be greatly ashamed , that trust in graven image , that say to the molten image , ye be we god .
hear , ye deaf ; and look , ye blind , that ye may see .
who be blind , but my servant ? or deaf , as my messenger that i send ? who be blind as he that be perfect , and blind as the lord 's servant ?
see many thing , but thou observest not ; open the ear , but he heareth not .
the lord be well pleased for he righteousness ' sake ; he will magnify the law , and make it honourable .
but this be a people rob and spoil ; they be all of they snare in hole , and they be hide in prison house : they be for a prey , and none delivereth ; for a spoil , and none saith , restore .
who among you will give ear to this ? who will hearken and hear for the time to come ?
who give jacob for a spoil , and israel to the robber ? do not the lord , he against whom we have sin ? for they would not walk in he way , neither be they obedient unto he law .
therefore he have pour upon he the fury of he anger , and the strength of battle : and it have set he on fire round about , yet he know not ; and it burn he , yet he lay it not to heart .
but now thus saith the lord that create thee , o jacob , and he that form thee , o israel , fear not : for i have redeem thee , i have call thee by thy name ; thou art mine .
when thou passest through the water , i will be with thee ; and through the river , they shall not overflow thee : when thou walkest through the fire , thou shalt not be burn ; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee .
for i be the lord thy god , the holy one of israel , thy saviour : i give egypt for thy ransom , ethiopia and seba for thee .
since thou wast precious in my sight , thou hast be honourable , and i have love thee : therefore will i give man for thee , and people for thy life .
fear not : for i be with thee : i will bring thy seed from the east , and gather thee from the west ;
i will say to the north , give up ; and to the south , keep not back : bring my son from far , and my daughter from the end of the earth ;
even every one that be call by my name : for i have create he for my glory , i have form he ; yea , i have make he .
bring forth the blind people that have eye , and the deaf that have ear .
let all the nation be gather together , and let the people be assemble : who among they can declare this , and shew we former thing ? let they bring forth they witness , that they may be justified : or let they hear , and say , it be truth .
ye be my witness , saith the lord , and my servant whom i have choose : that ye may know and believe i , and understand that i be he : before i there be no god form , neither shall there be after i .
i , even i , be the lord ; and beside i there be no saviour .
i have declare , and have save , and i have shew , when there be no strange god among you : therefore ye be my witness , saith the lord , that i be god .
yea , before the day be i be he ; and there be none that can deliver out of my hand : i will work , and who shall let it ?
thus saith the lord , you redeemer , the holy one of israel ; for you sake i have send to babylon , and have bring down all they noble , and the chaldeans , whose cry be in the ship .
i be the lord , you holy one , the creator of israel , you king .
thus saith the lord , which maketh a way in the sea , and a path in the mighty water ;
which bringeth forth the chariot and horse , the army and the power ; they shall lie down together , they shall not rise : they be extinct , they be quench as tow .
remember ye not the former thing , neither consider the thing of old .
behold , i will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ?
i will even make a way in the wilderness , and river in the desert .
the beast of the field shall honour i , the dragon and the owl : because i give water in the wilderness , and river in the desert , to give drink to my people , my choose .
this people have i form for myself ; they shall shew forth my praise .
but thou hast not call upon i , o jacob ; but thou hast be weary of i , o israel .
thou hast not bring i the small cattle of thy burnt offering ; neither hast thou honour i with thy sacrifice .
i have not cause thee to serve with a offering , nor wearied thee with incense .
thou hast buy i no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou fill i with the fat of thy sacrifice : but thou hast make i to serve with thy sin , thou hast weary i with thine iniquity .
i , even i , be he that blotteth out thy transgression for mine own sake , and will not remember thy sin .
put i in remembrance : let we plead together : declare thou , that thou mayest be justify .
thy first father have sin , and thy teacher have transgress against i .
therefore i have profane the prince of the sanctuary , and have give jacob to the curse , and israel to reproach .
yet now hear , o jacob my servant ; and israel , whom i have choose :
thus saith the lord that make thee , and form thee from the womb , which will help thee ; fear not , o jacob , my servant ; and thou , jesurun , whom i have choose .
for i will pour water upon he that be thirsty , and flood upon the dry ground : i will pour my spirit upon thy seed , and my blessing upon thine offspring :
and they shall spring up as among the grass , as willow by the water course .
one shall say , i be the lord 's ; and another shall call himself by the name of jacob ; and another shall subscribe with he hand unto the lord , and surname himself by the name of israel .
thus saith the lord the king of israel , and he redeemer the lord of host ; i be the first , and i be the last ; and beside i there be no god .
and who , as i , shall call , and shall declare it , and set it in order for i , since i appoint the ancient people ? and the thing that be come , and shall come , let they shew unto they .
fear ye not , neither be afraid : have not i tell thee from that time , and have declare it ? ye be even my witness .
be there a god beside i ? yea , there be no god ; i know not any .
they that make a graven image be all of they vanity ; and they delectable thing shall not profit ; and they be they own witness ; they see not , nor know ; that they may be ashamed .
who have form a god , or melt a graven image that be profitable for nothing ?
behold , all he fellow shall be ashamed : and the workman , they be of man : let they all be gather together , let they stand up ; yet they shall fear , and they shall be ashamed together .
the smith with the tong both worketh in the coal , and fashioneth it with hammer , and worketh it with the strength of he arm : yea , he be hungry , and he strength faileth : he drinketh no water , and be faint .
the carpenter stretcheth out he rule ; he marketh it out with a line ; he fitteth it with plane , and he marketh it out with the compass , and maketh it after the figure of a man , accord to the beauty of a man ; that it may remain in the house .
he heweth he down cedar , and taketh the cypress and the oak , which he strengtheneth for himself among the tree of the forest : he planteth a ash , and the rain doth nourish it .
then shall it be for a man to burn : for he will take thereof , and warm himself ; yea , he kindleth it , and baketh bread ; yea , he maketh a god , and worshippeth it ; he maketh it a graven image , and falleth down thereto .
he burneth part thereof in the fire ; with part thereof he eateth flesh ; he roasteth roast , and be satisfied : yea , he warmeth himself , and saith , aha , i be warm , i have see the fire :
and the residue thereof he maketh a god , even he graven image : he falleth down unto it , and worshippeth it , and prayeth unto it , and saith , deliver i ; for thou art my god .
they have not know nor understand : for he have shut they eye , that they can not see ; and they heart , that they can not understand .
and none considereth in he heart , neither be there knowledge nor understand to say , i have burn part of it in the fire ; yea , also i have baked bread upon the coal thereof ; i have roasted flesh , and eat it : and shall i make the residue thereof a abomination ? shall i fall down to the stock of a tree ?
he feedeth on ash : a deceive heart have turn he aside , that he can not deliver he soul , nor say , be there not a lie in my right hand ?
remember these , o jacob and israel ; for thou art my servant : i have form thee ; thou art my servant : o israel , thou shalt not be forget of i .
i have blot out , as a thick cloud , thy transgression , and , as a cloud , thy sin : return unto i ; for i have redeem thee .
sing , o ye heaven ; for the lord have do it : shout , ye lower part of the earth : break forth into singing , ye mountain , o forest , and every tree therein : for the lord have redeem jacob , and glorified himself in israel .
thus saith the lord , thy redeemer , and he that form thee from the womb , i be the lord that maketh all thing ; that stretcheth forth the heaven alone ; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself ;
that frustrateth the token of the liar , and maketh diviner mad ; that turneth wise man backward , and maketh they knowledge foolish ;
that confirmeth the word of he servant , and performeth the counsel of he messenger ; that saith to jerusalem , thou shalt be inhabit ; and to the city of judah , ye shall be build , and i will raise up the decayed place thereof :
that saith to the deep , be dry , and i will dry up thy river :
that saith of cyrus , he be my shepherd , and shall perform all my pleasure : even say to jerusalem , thou shalt be build ; and to the temple , thy foundation shall be lay .
thus saith the lord to he anointed , to cyrus , whose right hand i have holden , to subdue nation before he ; and i will loose the loin of king , to open before he the two leaved gate ; and the gate shall not be shut ;
i will go before thee , and make the crooked place straight : i will break in piece the gate of brass , and cut in sunder the bar of iron :
and i will give thee the treasure of darkness , and hidden riches of secret place , that thou mayest know that i , the lord , which call thee by thy name , be the god of israel .
for jacob my servant 's sake , and israel mine elect , i have even call thee by thy name : i have surname thee , though thou hast not know i .
i be the lord , and there be none else , there be no god beside i : i gird thee , though thou hast not know i :
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there be none beside i .
i be the lord , and there be none else .
i form the light , and create darkness : i make peace , and create evil : i the lord do all these thing .
drop down , ye heaven , from above , and let the sky pour down righteousness : let the earth open , and let they bring forth salvation , and let righteousness spring up together ; i the lord have create it .
woe unto he that striveth with he maker !
let the potsherd strive with the potsherd of the earth .
shall the clay say to he that fashioneth it , what makest thou ? or thy work , he have no hand ?
woe unto he that saith unto he father , what begettest thou ? or to the woman , what hast thou bring forth ?
thus saith the lord , the holy one of israel , and he maker , ask i of thing to come concern my son , and concern the work of my hand command ye i .
i have make the earth , and create man upon it : i , even my hand , have stretch out the heaven , and all they host have i command .
i have raise he up in righteousness , and i will direct all he way : he shall build my city , and he shall let go my captive , not for price nor reward , saith the lord of host .
thus saith the lord , the labour of egypt , and merchandise of ethiopia and of the sabeans , man of stature , shall come over unto thee , and they shall be thine : they shall come after thee ; in chain they shall come over , and they shall fall down unto thee , they shall make supplication unto thee , say , surely god be in thee ; and there be none else , there be no god .
verily thou art a god that hidest thyself , o god of israel , the saviour .
they shall be ashamed , and also confound , all of they : they shall go to confusion together that be maker of idol .
but israel shall be save in the lord with a everlasting salvation : ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end .
for thus saith the lord that create the heaven ; god himself that form the earth and make it ; he have establish it , he create it not in vain , he form it to be inhabit : i be the lord ; and there be none else .
i have not speak in secret , in a dark place of the earth : i say not unto the seed of jacob , seek ye i in vain : i the lord speak righteousness , i declare thing that be right .
assemble yourselve and come ; draw near together , ye that be escape of the nation : they have no knowledge that set up the wood of they graven image , and pray unto a god that can not save .
tell ye , and bring they near ; yea , let they take counsel together : who have declare this from ancient time ? who have tell it from that time ? have not i the lord ? and there be no god else beside i ; a just god and a saviour ; there be none beside i .
look unto i , and be ye save , all the end of the earth : for i be god , and there be none else .
i have swear by myself , the word be go out of my mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , that unto i every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
surely , shall one say , in the lord have i righteousness and strength : even to he shall man come ; and all that be incense against he shall be ashamed .
in the lord shall all the seed of israel be justified , and shall glory .
bel boweth down , nebo stoopeth , they idol be upon the beast , and upon the cattle : you carriage be heavy loaden ; they be a burden to the weary beast .
they stoop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves be go into captivity .
hearken unto i , o house of jacob , and all the remnant of the house of israel , which be bear by i from the belly , which be carry from the womb :
and even to you old age i be he ; and even to hoar hair will i carry you : i have make , and i will bear ; even i will carry , and will deliver you .
to whom will ye liken i , and make i equal , and compare i , that we may be like ?
they lavish gold out of the bag , and weigh silver in the balance , and hire a goldsmith ; and he maketh it a god : they fall down , yea , they worship .
they bear he upon the shoulder , they carry he , and set he in he place , and he standeth ; from he place shall he not remove : yea , one shall cry unto he , yet can he not answer , nor save he out of he trouble .
remember this , and shew yourselve man : bring it again to mind , o ye transgressor .
remember the former thing of old : for i be god , and there be none else ; i be god , and there be none like i ,
declare the end from the beginning , and from ancient time the thing that be not yet do , say , my counsel shall stand , and i will do all my pleasure :
call a ravenous bird from the east , the man that executeth my counsel from a far country : yea , i have speak it , i will also bring it to pass ; i have purpose it , i will also do it .
hearken unto i , ye stouthearted , that be far from righteousness :
i bring near my righteousness ; it shall not be far off , and my salvation shall not tarry : and i will place salvation in zion for israel my glory .
come down , and sit in the dust , o virgin daughter of babylon , sit on the ground : there be no throne , o daughter of the chaldeans : for thou shalt no more be call tender and delicate .
take the millstone , and grind meal : uncover thy lock , make bare the leg , uncover the thigh , pass over the river .
thy nakedness shall be uncover , yea , thy shame shall be see : i will take vengeance , and i will not meet thee as a man .
as for we redeemer , the lord of host be he name , the holy one of israel .
sit thou silent , and get thee into darkness , o daughter of the chaldeans : for thou shalt no more be call , the lady of kingdom .
i be wroth with my people , i have polluted mine inheritance , and give they into thine hand : thou didst shew they no mercy ; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily lay thy yoke .
and thou saidst , i shall be a lady for ever : so that thou didst not lay these thing to thy heart , neither didst remember the latter end of it .
therefore hear now this , thou that art give to pleasure , that dwellest carelessly , that sayest in thine heart , i be , and none else beside i ; i shall not sit as a widow , neither shall i know the loss of child :
but these two thing shall come to thee in a moment in one day , the loss of child , and widowhood : they shall come upon thee in they perfection for the multitude of thy sorcery , and for the great abundance of thine enchantment .
for thou hast trust in thy wickedness : thou hast say , none seeth i .
thy wisdom and thy knowledge , it have perverted thee ; and thou hast say in thine heart , i be , and none else beside i .
therefore shall evil come upon thee ; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth : and mischief shall fall upon thee ; thou shalt not be able to put it off : and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly , which thou shalt not know .
stand now with thine enchantment , and with the multitude of thy sorcery , wherein thou hast labour from thy youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to profit , if so be thou mayest prevail .
thou art weary in the multitude of thy counsel .
let now the astrologer , the stargazer , the monthly prognosticator , stand up , and save thee from these thing that shall come upon thee .
behold , they shall be as stubble ; the fire shall burn they ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame : there shall not be a coal to warm at , nor fire to sit before it .
thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured , even thy merchant , from thy youth : they shall wander every one to he quarter ; none shall save thee .
hear ye this , o house of jacob , which be call by the name of israel , and be come forth out of the water of judah , which swear by the name of the lord , and make mention of the god of israel , but not in truth , nor in righteousness .
for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves upon the god of israel ; the lord of host be he name .
i have declare the former thing from the beginning ; and they go forth out of my mouth , and i shew they ; i do they suddenly , and they come to pass .
because i know that thou art obstinate , and thy neck be a iron sinew , and thy brow brass ;
i have even from the beginning declare it to thee ; before it come to pass i shew it thee : lest thou shouldest say , mine idol have do they , and my graven image , and my molten image , have command they .
thou hast hear , see all this ; and will not ye declare it ?
i have shew thee new thing from this time , even hide thing , and thou didst not know they .
they be create now , and not from the beginning ; even before the day when thou heardest they not ; lest thou shouldest say , behold , i know they .
yea , thou heardest not ; yea , thou knewest not ; yea , from that time that thine ear be not open : for i know that thou wouldest deal very treacherously , and wast call a transgressor from the womb .
for my name 's sake will i defer mine anger , and for my praise will i refrain for thee , that i cut thee not off .
behold , i have refine thee , but not with silver ; i have choose thee in the furnace of affliction .
for mine own sake , even for mine own sake , will i do it : for how should my name be polluted ? and i will not give my glory unto another .
hearken unto i , o jacob and israel , my call ; i be he ; i be the first , i also be the last .
mine hand also have lay the foundation of the earth , and my right hand have span the heaven : when i call unto they , they stand up together .
all ye , assemble yourselve , and hear ; which among they have declare these thing ?
the lord have love he : he will do he pleasure on babylon , and he arm shall be on the chaldeans .
i , even i , have speak ; yea , i have call he : i have bring he , and he shall make he way prosperous .
come ye near unto i , hear ye this ; i have not speak in secret from the beginning ; from the time that it be , there be i : and now the lord god , and he spirit , have send i .
thus saith the lord , thy redeemer , the holy one of israel ; i be the lord thy god which teacheth thee to profit , which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go .
o that thou hadst hearken to my commandment ! then have thy peace be as a river , and thy righteousness as the wave of the sea :
thy seed also have be as the sand , and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof ; he name should not have be cut off nor destroy from before i .
go ye forth of babylon , flee ye from the chaldeans , with a voice of singing declare ye , tell this , utter it even to the end of the earth ; say ye , the lord have redeem he servant jacob .
and they thirst not when he lead they through the desert : he cause the water to flow out of the rock for they : he cleave the rock also , and the water gush out .
there be no peace , saith the lord , unto the wicked .
listen , o isle , unto i ; and hearken , ye people , from far ; the lord have call i from the womb ; from the bowels of my mother have he make mention of my name .
and he have make my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of he hand have he hide i , and make i a polished shaft ; in he quiver have he hide i ;
and say unto i , thou art my servant , o israel , in whom i will be glorified .
then i say , i have labour in vain , i have spend my strength for nought , and in vain : yet surely my judgment be with the lord , and my work with my god .
and now , saith the lord that form i from the womb to be he servant , to bring jacob again to he , though israel be not gather , yet shall i be glorious in the eye of the lord , and my god shall be my strength .
and he say , it be a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribe of jacob , and to restore the preserved of israel : i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles , that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth .
thus saith the lord , the redeemer of israel , and he holy one , to he whom man despiseth , to he whom the nation abhorreth , to a servant of ruler , king shall see and arise , prince also shall worship , because of the lord that be faithful , and the holy one of israel , and he shall choose thee .
thus saith the lord , in a acceptable time have i hear thee , and in a day of salvation have i help thee : and i will preserve thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , to establish the earth , to cause to inherit the desolate heritage ;
that thou mayest say to the prisoner , go forth ; to they that be in darkness , shew yourselve .
they shall feed in the way , and they pasture shall be in all high place .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun smite they : for he that have mercy on they shall lead they , even by the spring of water shall he guide they .
and i will make all my mountain a way , and my highway shall be exalt .
behold , these shall come from far : and , lo , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of sinim .
sing , o heaven ; and be joyful , o earth ; and break forth into singing , o mountain : for the lord have comfort he people , and will have mercy upon he afflict .
but zion say , the lord have forsake i , and my lord have forget i .
can a woman forget she sucking child , that she should not have compassion on the son of she womb ? yea , they may forget , yet will i not forget thee .
behold , i have grave thee upon the palm of my hand ; thy wall be continually before i .
thy child shall make haste ; thy destroyer and they that make thee waste shall go forth of thee .
lift up thine eye round about , and behold : all these gather themselves together , and come to thee .
as i live , saith the lord , thou shalt surely clothe thee with they all , as with a ornament , and bind they on thee , as a bride doeth .
for thy waste and thy desolate place , and the land of thy destruction , shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitant , and they that swallow thee up shall be far away .
the child which thou shalt have , after thou hast lose the other , shall say again in thine ear , the place be too strait for i : give place to i that i may dwell .
then shalt thou say in thine heart , who have begotten i these , see i have lose my child , and be desolate , a captive , and remove to and fro ? and who have bring up these ?
behold , i be leave alone ; these , where have they be ?
thus saith the lord god , behold , i will lift up mine hand to the gentiles , and set up my standard to the people : and they shall bring thy son in they arm , and thy daughter shall be carry upon they shoulder .
and king shall be thy nursing father , and they queen thy nursing mother : they shall bow down to thee with they face toward the earth , and lick up the dust of thy foot ; and thou shalt know that i be the lord : for they shall not be ashamed that wait for i .
shall the prey be take from the mighty , or the lawful captive deliver ?
but thus saith the lord , even the captive of the mighty shall be take away , and the prey of the terrible shall be deliver : for i will contend with he that contendeth with thee , and i will save thy child .
and i will feed they that oppress thee with they own flesh ; and they shall be drunken with they own blood , as with sweet wine : and all flesh shall know that i the lord be thy saviour and thy redeemer , the mighty one of jacob .
thus saith the lord , where be the bill of you mother 's divorcement , whom i have put away ? or which of my creditor be it to whom i have sell you ?
behold , for you iniquity have ye sell yourselve , and for you transgression be you mother put away .
wherefore , when i come , be there no man ? when i call , be there none to answer ?
be my hand shorten at all , that it can not redeem ? or have i no power to deliver ? behold , at my rebuke i dry up the sea , i make the river a wilderness : they fish stinketh , because there be no water , and dieth for thirst .
i clothe the heaven with blackness , and i make sackcloth they covering .
the lord god have give i the tongue of the learn , that i should know how to speak a word in season to he that be weary : he wakeneth morning by morning , he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learn .
the lord god have open mine ear , and i be not rebellious , neither turn away back .
i give my back to the smiter , and my cheek to they that pluck off the hair : i hide not my face from shame and spitting .
for the lord god will help i ; therefore shall i not be confound : therefore have i set my face like a flint , and i know that i shall not be ashamed .
he be near that justifieth i ; who will contend with i ? let we stand together : who be mine adversary ? let he come near to i .
behold , the lord god will help i ; who be he that shall condemn i ? lo , they all shall wax old as a garment ; the moth shall eat they up .
who be among you that feareth the lord , that obeyeth the voice of he servant , that walketh in darkness , and have no light ? let he trust in the name of the lord , and stay upon he god .
behold , all ye that kindle a fire , that compass yourselve about with spark : walk in the light of you fire , and in the spark that ye have kindle .
this shall ye have of mine hand ; ye shall lie down in sorrow .
hearken to i , ye that follow after righteousness , ye that seek the lord : look unto the rock whence ye be hew , and to the hole of the pit whence ye be dig .
look unto abraham you father , and unto sarah that bare you : for i call he alone , and bless he , and increase he .
for the lord shall comfort zion : he will comfort all she waste place ; and he will make she wilderness like eden , and she desert like the garden of the lord ; joy and gladness shall be find therein , thanksgiving , and the voice of melody .
hearken unto i , my people ; and give ear unto i , o my nation : for a law shall proceed from i , and i will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people .
my righteousness be near ; my salvation be go forth , and mine arm shall judge the people ; the isle shall wait upon i , and on mine arm shall they trust .
lift up you eye to the heaven , and look upon the earth beneath : for the heaven shall vanish away like smoke , and the earth shall wax old like a garment , and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner : but my salvation shall be for ever , and my righteousness shall not be abolish .
hearken unto i , ye that know righteousness , the people in whose heart be my law ; fear ye not the reproach of man , neither be ye afraid of they reviling .
for the moth shall eat they up like a garment , and the worm shall eat they like wool : but my righteousness shall be for ever , and my salvation from generation to generation .
awake , awake , put on strength , o arm of the lord ; awake , as in the ancient day , in the generation of old .
art thou not it that have cut rahab , and wound the dragon ?
art thou not it which have dry the sea , the water of the great deep ; that have make the depths of the sea a way for the ransom to pass over ?
therefore the redeem of the lord shall return , and come with singing unto zion ; and everlasting joy shall be upon they head : they shall obtain gladness and joy ; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away .
i , even i , be he that comforteth you : who art thou , that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die , and of the son of man which shall be make as grass ;
and forgettest the lord thy maker , that have stretch forth the heaven , and lay the foundation of the earth ; and hast fear continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor , as if he be ready to destroy ? and where be the fury of the oppressor ?
the captive exile hasteneth that he may be loose , and that he should not die in the pit , nor that he bread should fail .
but i be the lord thy god , that divide the sea , whose wave roar : the lord of host be he name .
and i have put my word in thy mouth , and i have cover thee in the shadow of mine hand , that i may plant the heaven , and lay the foundation of the earth , and say unto zion , thou art my people .
awake , awake , stand up , o jerusalem , which hast drunk at the hand of the lord the cup of he fury ; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of tremble , and wring they out .
there be none to guide she among all the son whom she have bring forth ; neither be there any that taketh she by the hand of all the son that she have bring up .
these two thing be come unto thee ; who shall be sorry for thee ? desolation , and destruction , and the famine , and the sword : by whom shall i comfort thee ?
thy son have faint , they lie at the head of all the street , as a wild bull in a net : they be full of the fury of the lord , the rebuke of thy god .
therefore hear now this , thou afflict , and drunken , but not with wine :
thus saith thy lord the lord , and thy god that pleadeth the cause of he people , behold , i have take out of thine hand the cup of tremble , even the dregs of the cup of my fury ; thou shalt no more drink it again :
but i will put it into the hand of they that afflict thee ; which have say to thy soul , bow down , that we may go over : and thou hast lay thy body as the ground , and as the street , to they that go over .
awake , awake ; put on thy strength , o zion ; put on thy beautiful garment , o jerusalem , the holy city : for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean .
shake thyself from the dust ; arise , and sit down , o jerusalem : loose thyself from the band of thy neck , o captive daughter of zion .
for thus saith the lord , ye have sell yourselve for nought ; and ye shall be redeem without money .
for thus saith the lord god , my people go down aforetime into egypt to sojourn there ; and the assyrian oppressed they without cause .
now therefore , what have i here , saith the lord , that my people be take away for nought ? they that rule over they make they to howl , saith the lord ; and my name continually every day be blaspheme .
therefore my people shall know my name : therefore they shall know in that day that i be he that doth speak : behold , it be i.
how beautiful upon the mountain be the foot of he that bringeth good tiding , that publisheth peace ; that bringeth good tiding of good , that publisheth salvation ; that saith unto zion , thy god reigneth !
thy watchman shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they sing : for they shall see eye to eye , when the lord shall bring again zion .
break forth into joy , sing together , ye waste place of jerusalem : for the lord have comfort he people , he have redeem jerusalem .
the lord have make bare he holy arm in the eye of all the nation ; and all the end of the earth shall see the salvation of we god .
depart ye , depart ye , go ye out from thence , touch no unclean thing ; go ye out of the midst of she ; be ye clean , that bear the vessel of the lord .
for ye shall not go out with haste , nor go by flight : for the lord will go before you ; and the god of israel will be you rereward .
behold , my servant shall deal prudently , he shall be exalt and extol , and be very high .
as many be astony at thee ; he visage be so mar more than any man , and he form more than the son of man :
so shall he sprinkle many nation ; the king shall shut they mouth at he : for that which have not be tell they shall they see ; and that which they have not hear shall they consider .
who have believe we report ? and to whom be the arm of the lord reveal ?
for he shall grow up before he as a tender plant , and as a root out of a dry ground : he have no form nor comeliness ; and when we shall see he , there be no beauty that we should desire he .
he be despise and reject of man ; a man of sorrow , and acquaint with grief : and we hide as it be we face from he ; he be despise , and we esteem he not .
surely he have bear we grief , and carry we sorrow : yet we do esteem he stricken , smitten of god , and afflict .
but he be wound for we transgression , he be bruise for we iniquity : the chastisement of we peace be upon he ; and with he stripe we be heal .
all we like sheep have go astray ; we have turn every one to he own way ; and the lord have lay on he the iniquity of we all .
he be oppress , and he be afflict , yet he open not he mouth : he be bring as a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before she shearer be dumb , so he openeth not he mouth .
he be take from prison and from judgment : and who shall declare he generation ? for he be cut off out of the land of the living : for the transgression of my people be he stricken .
and he make he grave with the wicked , and with the rich in he death ; because he have do no violence , neither be any deceit in he mouth .
yet it please the lord to bruise he ; he have put he to grief : when thou shalt make he soul a offering for sin , he shall see he seed , he shall prolong he day , and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in he hand .
he shall see of the travail of he soul , and shall be satisfy : by he knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many ; for he shall bear they iniquity .
therefore will i divide he a portion with the great , and he shall divide the spoil with the strong ; because he have pour out he soul unto death : and he be number with the transgressor ; and he bare the sin of many , and make intercession for the transgressor .
sing , o barren , thou that didst not bear ; break forth into singing , and cry aloud , thou that didst not travail with child : for more be the child of the desolate than the child of the married wife , saith the lord .
enlarge the place of thy tent , and let they stretch forth the curtain of thine habitation : spare not , lengthen thy cord , and strengthen thy stake ;
for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the leave ; and thy seed shall inherit the gentiles , and make the desolate city to be inhabit .
fear not ; for thou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thou confound ; for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth , and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more .
for thy maker be thine husband ; the lord of host be he name ; and thy redeemer the holy one of israel ; the god of the whole earth shall he be call .
for the lord have call thee as a woman forsake and grieve in spirit , and a wife of youth , when thou wast refuse , saith thy god .
for a small moment have i forsake thee ; but with great mercy will i gather thee .
in a little wrath i hide my face from thee for a moment ; but with everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee , saith the lord thy redeemer .
for this be as the water of noah unto i : for as i have swear that the water of noah should no more go over the earth ; so have i swear that i would not be wroth with thee , nor rebuke thee .
for the mountain shall depart , and the hill be remove ; but my kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the covenant of my peace be remove , saith the lord that have mercy on thee .
o thou afflict , toss with tempest , and not comfort , behold , i will lay thy stone with fair colour , and lay thy foundation with sapphire .
and i will make thy window of agate , and thy gate of carbuncle , and all thy border of pleasant stone .
and all thy child shall be teach of the lord ; and great shall be the peace of thy child .
in righteousness shalt thou be establish : thou shalt be far from oppression ; for thou shalt not fear : and from terror ; for it shall not come near thee .
behold , they shall surely gather together , but not by i : whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake .
behold , i have create the smith that bloweth the coal in the fire , and that bringeth forth a instrument for he work ; and i have create the waster to destroy .
no weapon that be form against thee shall prosper ; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn .
this be the heritage of the servant of the lord , and they righteousness be of i , saith the lord .
ho , every one that thirsteth , come ye to the water , and he that have no money ; come ye , buy , and eat ; yea , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
wherefore do ye spend money for that which be not bread ? and you labour for that which satisfieth not ? hearken diligently unto i , and eat ye that which be good , and let you soul delight itself in fatness .
incline you ear , and come unto i : hear , and you soul shall live ; and i will make a everlasting covenant with you , even the sure mercy of david .
behold , i have give he for a witness to the people , a leader and commander to the people .
behold , thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not , and nation that know not thee shall run unto thee because of the lord thy god , and for the holy one of israel ; for he have glorified thee .
seek ye the lord while he may be find , call ye upon he while he be near :
let the wicked forsake he way , and the unrighteous man he thought : and let he return unto the lord , and he will have mercy upon he ; and to we god , for he will abundantly pardon .
for my thought be not you thought , neither be you way my way , saith the lord .
for as the heaven be higher than the earth , so be my way higher than you way , and my thought than you thought .
for as the rain cometh down , and the snow from heaven , and returneth not thither , but watereth the earth , and maketh it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the sower , and bread to the eater :
so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it shall not return unto i void , but it shall accomplish that which i please , and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i send it .
for ye shall go out with joy , and be lead forth with peace : the mountain and the hill shall break forth before you into singing , and all the tree of the field shall clap they hand .
instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree , and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree : and it shall be to the lord for a name , for a everlasting sign that shall not be cut off .
thus saith the lord , keep ye judgment , and do justice : for my salvation be near to come , and my righteousness to be reveal .
bless be the man that doeth this , and the son of man that layeth hold on it ; that keepeth the sabbath from pollute it , and keepeth he hand from do any evil .
neither let the son of the stranger , that have join himself to the lord , speak , say , the lord have utterly separate i from he people : neither let the eunuch say , behold , i be a dry tree .
for thus saith the lord unto the eunuch that keep my sabbath , and choose the thing that please i , and take hold of my covenant ;
even unto they will i give in mine house and within my wall a place and a name better than of son and of daughter : i will give they a everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the son of the stranger , that join themselves to the lord , to serve he , and to love the name of the lord , to be he servant , every one that keepeth the sabbath from pollute it , and taketh hold of my covenant ;
even they will i bring to my holy mountain , and make they joyful in my house of prayer : they burnt offering and they sacrifice shall be accept upon mine altar ; for mine house shall be call a house of prayer for all people .
the lord god , which gathereth the outcast of israel saith , yet will i gather other to he , beside those that be gather unto he .
all ye beast of the field , come to devour , yea , all ye beast in the forest .
he watchman be blind : they be all ignorant , they be all dumb dog , they can not bark ; sleep , lie down , loving to slumber .
yea , they be greedy dog which can never have enough , and they be shepherd that can not understand : they all look to they own way , every one for he gain , from he quarter .
come ye , say they , i will fetch wine , and we will fill ourselves with strong drink ; and to morrow shall be as this day , and much more abundant .
the righteous perisheth , and no man layeth it to heart : and merciful man be take away , none consider that the righteous be take away from the evil to come .
he shall enter into peace : they shall rest in they bed , each one walk in he uprightness .
but draw near hither , ye son of the sorceress , the seed of the adulterer and the whore .
against whom do ye sport yourselve ? against whom make ye a wide mouth , and draw out the tongue ? be ye not child of transgression , a seed of falsehood ,
enflame yourselve with idol under every green tree , slaying the child in the valley under the clift of the rock ?
among the smooth stone of the stream be thy portion ; they , they be thy lot : even to they hast thou pour a drink offering , thou hast offer a meat offering .
should i receive comfort in these ?
upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed : even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice .
behind the door also and the post hast thou set up thy remembrance : for thou hast discover thyself to another than i , and art go up ; thou hast enlarged thy bed , and make thee a covenant with they ; thou lovedst they bed where thou sawest it .
and thou wentest to the king with ointment , and didst increase thy perfume , and didst send thy messenger far off , and didst debase thyself even unto hell .
thou art weary in the greatness of thy way ; yet saidst thou not , there be no hope : thou hast find the life of thine hand ; therefore thou wast not grieve .
and of whom hast thou be afraid or fear , that thou hast lie , and hast not remember i , nor lay it to thy heart ? have not i hold my peace even of old , and thou fearest i not ?
i will declare thy righteousness , and thy work ; for they shall not profit thee .
when thou criest , let thy company deliver thee ; but the wind shall carry they all away ; vanity shall take they : but he that putteth he trust in i shall possess the land , and shall inherit my holy mountain ;
and shall say , cast ye up , cast ye up , prepare the way , take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people .
for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity , whose name be holy ; i dwell in the high and holy place , with he also that be of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contrite one .
for i will not contend for ever , neither will i be always wroth : for the spirit should fail before i , and the soul which i have make .
for the iniquity of he covetousness be i wroth , and smite he : i hide i , and be wroth , and he go on frowardly in the way of he heart .
i have see he way , and will heal he : i will lead he also , and restore comfort unto he and to he mourner .
i create the fruit of the lip ; peace , peace to he that be far off , and to he that be near , saith the lord ; and i will heal he .
but the wicked be like the troubled sea , when it can not rest , whose water cast up mire and dirt .
there be no peace , saith my god , to the wicked .
cry aloud , spare not , lift up thy voice like a trumpet , and shew my people they transgression , and the house of jacob they sin .
yet they seek i daily , and delight to know my way , as a nation that do righteousness , and forsake not the ordinance of they god : they ask of i the ordinance of justice ; they take delight in approach to god .
wherefore have we fast , say they , and thou seest not ? wherefore have we afflict we soul , and thou takest no knowledge ?
behold , in the day of you fast ye find pleasure , and exact all you labour .
behold , ye fast for strife and debate , and to smite with the fist of wickedness : ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make you voice to be hear on high .
be it such a fast that i have choose ? a day for a man to afflict he soul ? be it to bow down he head as a bulrush , and to spread sackcloth and ash under he ? wilt thou call this a fast , and a acceptable day to the lord ?
be not this the fast that i have choose ? to loose the band of wickedness , to undo the heavy burden , and to let the oppressed go free , and that ye break every yoke ?
be it not to deal thy bread to the hungry , and that thou bring the poor that be cast out to thy house ? when thou seest the naked , that thou cover he ; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh ?
then shall thy light break forth as the morning , and thine health shall spring forth speedily : and thy righteousness shall go before thee ; the glory of the lord shall be thy rereward .
then shalt thou call , and the lord shall answer ; thou shalt cry , and he shall say , here i be .
if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke , the put forth of the finger , and speak vanity ;
and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflict soul ; then shall thy light rise in obscurity , and thy darkness be as the noon day :
and the lord shall guide thee continually , and satisfy thy soul in drought , and make fat thy bone : and thou shalt be like a water garden , and like a spring of water , whose water fail not .
and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste place : thou shalt raise up the foundation of many generation ; and thou shalt be call , the repairer of the breach , the restorer of path to dwell in .
if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath , from do thy pleasure on my holy day ; and call the sabbath a delight , the holy of the lord , honourable ; and shalt honour he , not do thine own way , nor find thine own pleasure , nor speak thine own word :
then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord ; and i will cause thee to ride upon the high place of the earth , and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father : for the mouth of the lord have speak it .
behold , the lord 's hand be not shorten , that it can not save ; neither he ear heavy , that it can not hear :
but you iniquity have separate between you and you god , and you sin have hide he face from you , that he will not hear .
for you hand be defile with blood , and you finger with iniquity ; you lip have speak lie , you tongue have muttered perverseness .
none calleth for justice , nor any pleadeth for truth : they trust in vanity , and speak lie ; they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity .
they hatch cockatrice ' egg , and weave the spider 's web : he that eateth of they egg dieth , and that which be crushed breaketh out into a viper .
they web shall not become garment , neither shall they cover themselves with they work : they work be work of iniquity , and the act of violence be in they hand .
they foot run to evil , and they make haste to shed innocent blood : they thought be thought of iniquity ; waste and destruction be in they path .
the way of peace they know not ; and there be no judgment in they going : they have make they crooked path : whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace .
therefore be judgment far from we , neither doth justice overtake we : we wait for light , but behold obscurity ; for brightness , but we walk in darkness .
we grope for the wall like the blind , and we grope as if we have no eye : we stumble at noon day as in the night ; we be in desolate place as dead man .
we roar all like bear , and mourn sore like dove : we look for judgment , but there be none ; for salvation , but it be far off from we .
for we transgression be multiply before thee , and we sin testify against we : for we transgression be with we ; and as for we iniquity , we know they ;
in transgress and lie against the lord , and depart away from we god , speak oppression and revolt , conceive and utter from the heart word of falsehood .
and judgment be turn away backward , and justice standeth afar off : for truth be fall in the street , and equity can not enter .
yea , truth faileth ; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey : and the lord see it , and it displeased he that there be no judgment .
and he see that there be no man , and wonder that there be no intercessor : therefore he arm bring salvation unto he ; and he righteousness , it sustain he .
for he put on righteousness as a breastplate , and a helmet of salvation upon he head ; and he put on the garment of vengeance for clothing , and be clothe with zeal as a cloak .
accord to they deed , accordingly he will repay , fury to he adversary , recompence to he enemy ; to the island he will repay recompence .
so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west , and he glory from the rising of the sun .
when the enemy shall come in like a flood , the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against he .
and the redeemer shall come to zion , and unto they that turn from transgression in jacob , saith the lord .
as for i , this be my covenant with they , saith the lord ; my spirit that be upon thee , and my word which i have put in thy mouth , shall not depart out of thy mouth , nor out of the mouth of thy seed , nor out of the mouth of thy seed 's seed , saith the lord , from henceforth and for ever .
arise , shine ; for thy light be come , and the glory of the lord be rise upon thee .
for , behold , the darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the people : but the lord shall arise upon thee , and he glory shall be see upon thee .
and the gentiles shall come to thy light , and king to the brightness of thy rise .
lift up thine eye round about , and see : all they gather themselves together , they come to thee : thy son shall come from far , and thy daughter shall be nurse at thy side .
then thou shalt see , and flow together , and thine heart shall fear , and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be convert unto thee , the force of the gentiles shall come unto thee .
the multitude of camel shall cover thee , the dromedary of midian and ephah ; all they from sheba shall come : they shall bring gold and incense ; and they shall shew forth the praise of the lord .
all the flock of kedar shall be gather together unto thee , the ram of nebaioth shall minister unto thee : they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar , and i will glorify the house of my glory .
who be these that fly as a cloud , and as the dove to they window ?
surely the isle shall wait for i , and the ship of tarshish first , to bring thy son from far , they silver and they gold with they , unto the name of the lord thy god , and to the holy one of israel , because he have glorified thee .
and the son of stranger shall build up thy wall , and they king shall minister unto thee : for in my wrath i smite thee , but in my favour have i have mercy on thee .
therefore thy gate shall be open continually ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that man may bring unto thee the force of the gentiles , and that they king may be bring .
for the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish ; yea , those nation shall be utterly waste .
the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee , the fir tree , the pine tree , and the box together , to beautify the place of my sanctuary ; and i will make the place of my foot glorious .
the son also of they that afflict thee shall come bend unto thee ; and all they that despise thee shall bow themselves down at the sole of thy foot ; and they shall call thee , the city of the lord , the zion of the holy one of israel .
whereas thou hast be forsake and hate , so that no man go through thee , i will make thee a eternal excellency , a joy of many generation .
thou shalt also suck the milk of the gentiles , and shalt suck the breast of king : and thou shalt know that i the lord be thy saviour and thy redeemer , the mighty one of jacob .
for brass i will bring gold , and for iron i will bring silver , and for wood brass , and for stone iron : i will also make thy officer peace , and thine exactor righteousness .
violence shall no more be hear in thy land , waste nor destruction within thy border ; but thou shalt call thy wall salvation , and thy gate praise .
the sun shall be no more thy light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee : but the lord shall be unto thee a everlasting light , and thy god thy glory .
thy sun shall no more go down ; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself : for the lord shall be thine everlasting light , and the day of thy mourning shall be end .
thy people also shall be all righteous : they shall inherit the land for ever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hand , that i may be glorified .
a little one shall become a thousand , and a small one a strong nation : i the lord will hasten it in he time .
the spirit of the lord god be upon i ; because the lord have anointed i to preach good tiding unto the meek ; he have send i to bind up the brokenhearted , to proclaim liberty to the captive , and the opening of the prison to they that be bind ;
to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord , and the day of vengeance of we god ; to comfort all that mourn ;
to appoint unto they that mourn in zion , to give unto they beauty for ash , the oil of joy for mourning , the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness ; that they might be call tree of righteousness , the planting of the lord , that he might be glorified .
and they shall build the old waste , they shall raise up the former desolation , and they shall repair the waste city , the desolation of many generation .
and stranger shall stand and feed you flock , and the son of the alien shall be you plowman and you vinedresser .
but ye shall be name the priests of the lord : man shall call you the ministers of we god : ye shall eat the riches of the gentiles , and in they glory shall ye boast yourselve .
for you shame ye shall have double ; and for confusion they shall rejoice in they portion : therefore in they land they shall possess the double : everlasting joy shall be unto they .
for i the lord love judgment , i hate robbery for burnt offering ; and i will direct they work in truth , and i will make a everlasting covenant with they .
and they seed shall be know among the gentiles , and they offspring among the people : all that see they shall acknowledge they , that they be the seed which the lord have bless .
i will greatly rejoice in the lord , my soul shall be joyful in my god ; for he have clothe i with the garment of salvation , he have cover i with the robe of righteousness , as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornament , and as a bride adorneth herself with she jewel .
for as the earth bringeth forth she bud , and as the garden causeth the thing that be sow in it to spring forth ; so the lord god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nation .
for zion 's sake will i not hold my peace , and for jerusalem 's sake i will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth .
and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness , and all king thy glory : and thou shalt be call by a new name , which the mouth of the lord shall name .
thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord , and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god .
thou shalt no more be term forsaken ; neither shall thy land any more be term desolate : but thou shalt be call hephzibah , and thy land beulah : for the lord delighteth in thee , and thy land shall be marry .
for as a young man marrieth a virgin , so shall thy son marry thee : and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride , so shall thy god rejoice over thee .
i have set watchman upon thy wall , o jerusalem , which shall never hold they peace day nor night : ye that make mention of the lord , keep not silence ,
and give he no rest , till he establish , and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth .
the lord have swear by he right hand , and by the arm of he strength , surely i will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemy ; and the son of the stranger shall not drink thy wine , for the which thou hast labour :
but they that have gather it shall eat it , and praise the lord ; and they that have bring it together shall drink it in the court of my holiness .
go through , go through the gate ; prepare ye the way of the people ; cast up , cast up the highway ; gather out the stone ; lift up a standard for the people .
behold , the lord have proclaimed unto the end of the world , say ye to the daughter of zion , behold , thy salvation cometh ; behold , he reward be with he , and he work before he .
and they shall call they , the holy people , the redeem of the lord : and thou shalt be call , sought out , a city not forsake .
who be this that cometh from edom , with dye garment from bozrah ? this that be glorious in he apparel , travel in the greatness of he strength ?
i that speak in righteousness , mighty to save .
wherefore art thou red in thine apparel , and thy garment like he that treadeth in the winefat ?
i have trodden the winepress alone ; and of the people there be none with i : for i will tread they in mine anger , and trample they in my fury ; and they blood shall be sprinkle upon my garment , and i will stain all my raiment .
for the day of vengeance be in mine heart , and the year of my redeem be come .
and i look , and there be none to help ; and i wonder that there be none to uphold : therefore mine own arm bring salvation unto i ; and my fury , it uphold i .
and i will tread down the people in mine anger , and make they drunk in my fury , and i will bring down they strength to the earth .
i will mention the lovingkindness of the lord , and the praise of the lord , accord to all that the lord have bestow on we , and the great goodness toward the house of israel , which he have bestow on they accord to he mercy , and accord to the multitude of he lovingkindness .
for he say , surely they be my people , child that will not lie : so he be they saviour .
in all they affliction he be afflict , and the angel of he presence save they : in he love and in he pity he redeem they ; and he bare they , and carry they all the day of old .
but they rebel , and vex he holy spirit : therefore he be turn to be they enemy , and he fight against they .
then he remember the day of old , moses , and he people , say , where be he that bring they up out of the sea with the shepherd of he flock ? where be he that put he holy spirit within he ?
that lead they by the right hand of mose with he glorious arm , divide the water before they , to make himself a everlasting name ?
that lead they through the deep , as a horse in the wilderness , that they should not stumble ?
as a beast goeth down into the valley , the spirit of the lord cause he to rest : so didst thou lead thy people , to make thyself a glorious name .
look down from heaven , and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory : where be thy zeal and thy strength , the sound of thy bowels and of thy mercy toward i ? be they restrain ?
doubtless thou art we father , though abraham be ignorant of we , and israel acknowledge we not : thou , o lord , art we father , we redeemer ; thy name be from everlasting .
o lord , why hast thou make we to err from thy way , and harden we heart from thy fear ?
return for thy servant ' sake , the tribe of thine inheritance .
the people of thy holiness have possess it but a little while : we adversary have trodden down thy sanctuary .
we be thine : thou never barest rule over they ; they be not call by thy name .
oh that thou wouldest rend the heaven , that thou wouldest come down , that the mountain might flow down at thy presence ,
as when the melting fire burneth , the fire causeth the water to boil , to make thy name know to thine adversary , that the nation may tremble at thy presence !
when thou didst terrible thing which we look not for , thou camest down , the mountain flow down at thy presence .
for since the beginning of the world man have not hear , nor perceive by the ear , neither have the eye see , o god , beside thee , what he have prepare for he that waiteth for he .
thou meetest he that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness , those that remember thee in thy way : behold , thou art wroth ; for we have sin : in those be continuance , and we shall be save .
but we be all as a unclean thing , and all we righteousness be as filthy rag ; and we all do fade as a leaf ; and we iniquity , like the wind , have take we away .
and there be none that calleth upon thy name , that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee : for thou hast hide thy face from we , and hast consume we , because of we iniquity .
but now , o lord , thou art we father ; we be the clay , and thou we potter ; and we all be the work of thy hand .
be not wroth very sore , o lord , neither remember iniquity for ever : behold , see , we beseech thee , we be all thy people .
thy holy city be a wilderness , zion be a wilderness , jerusalem a desolation .
we holy and we beautiful house , where we father praise thee , be burn up with fire : and all we pleasant thing be lay waste .
wilt thou refrain thyself for these thing , o lord ? wilt thou hold thy peace , and afflict we very sore ?
i be seek of they that ask not for i ; i be find of they that seek i not : i say , behold i , behold i , unto a nation that be not call by my name .
i have spread out my hand all the day unto a rebellious people , which walketh in a way that be not good , after they own thought ;
a people that provoketh i to anger continually to my face ; that sacrificeth in garden , and burneth incense upon altar of brick ;
which remain among the grave , and lodge in the monument , which eat swine 's flesh , and broth of abominable thing be in they vessel ;
which say , stand by thyself , come not near to i ; for i be holier than thou .
these be a smoke in my nose , a fire that burneth all the day .
behold , it be write before i : i will not keep silence , but will recompense , even recompense into they bosom ,
you iniquity , and the iniquity of you father together , saith the lord , which have burn incense upon the mountain , and blaspheme i upon the hill : therefore will i measure they former work into they bosom .
thus saith the lord , as the new wine be find in the cluster , and one saith , destroy it not ; for a blessing be in it : so will i do for my servant ' sake , that i may not destroy they all .
and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob , and out of judah a inheritor of my mountain : and mine elect shall inherit it , and my servant shall dwell there .
and sharon shall be a fold of flock , and the valley of achor a place for the herd to lie down in , for my people that have seek i .
but ye be they that forsake the lord , that forget my holy mountain , that prepare a table for that troop , and that furnish the drink offering unto that number .
therefore will i number you to the sword , and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter : because when i call , ye do not answer ; when i speak , ye do not hear ; but do evil before mine eye , and do choose that wherein i delight not .
therefore thus saith the lord god , behold , my servant shall eat , but ye shall be hungry : behold , my servant shall drink , but ye shall be thirsty : behold , my servant shall rejoice , but ye shall be ashamed :
behold , my servant shall sing for joy of heart , but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart , and shall howl for vexation of spirit .
and ye shall leave you name for a curse unto my choose : for the lord god shall slay thee , and call he servant by another name :
that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth ; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth ; because the former trouble be forget , and because they be hide from mine eye .
for , behold , i create new heaven and a new earth : and the former shall not be remember , nor come into mind .
but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create : for , behold , i create jerusalem a rejoicing , and she people a joy .
and i will rejoice in jerusalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of weep shall be no more hear in she , nor the voice of cry .
there shall be no more thence a infant of day , nor a old man that have not fill he day : for the child shall die a hundred year old ; but the sinner be a hundred year old shall be accurse .
and they shall build house , and inhabit they ; and they shall plant vineyard , and eat the fruit of they .
they shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the day of a tree be the day of my people , and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of they hand .
they shall not labour in vain , nor bring forth for trouble ; for they be the seed of the bless of the lord , and they offspring with they .
and it shall come to pass , that before they call , i will answer ; and while they be yet speak , i will hear .
the wolf and the lamb shall feed together , and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock : and dust shall be the serpent 's meat .
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord , the heaven be my throne , and the earth be my footstool : where be the house that ye build unto i ? and where be the place of my rest ?
for all those thing have mine hand make , and all those thing have be , saith the lord : but to this man will i look , even to he that be poor and of a contrite spirit , and trembleth at my word .
he that killeth a ox be as if he slew a man ; he that sacrificeth a lamb , as if he cut off a dog 's neck ; he that offereth a oblation , as if he offer swine 's blood ; he that burneth incense , as if he bless a idol .
yea , they have choose they own way , and they soul delighteth in they abomination .
i also will choose they delusion , and will bring they fear upon they ; because when i call , none do answer ; when i speak , they do not hear : but they do evil before mine eye , and choose that in which i delight not .
hear the word of the lord , ye that tremble at he word ; you brethren that hate you , that cast you out for my name 's sake , say , let the lord be glorified : but he shall appear to you joy , and they shall be ashamed .
a voice of noise from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of the lord that rendereth recompence to he enemy .
before she travail , she bring forth ; before she pain come , she be deliver of a man child .
who have hear such a thing ? who have see such thing ?
shall the earth be make to bring forth in one day ? or shall a nation be bear at once ? for as soon as zion travail , she bring forth she child .
shall i bring to the birth , and not cause to bring forth ? saith the lord : shall i cause to bring forth , and shut the womb ? saith thy god .
rejoice ye with jerusalem , and be glad with she , all ye that love she : rejoice for joy with she , all ye that mourn for she :
that ye may suck , and be satisfy with the breast of she consolation ; that ye may milk out , and be delight with the abundance of she glory .
for thus saith the lord , behold , i will extend peace to she like a river , and the glory of the gentiles like a flow stream : then shall ye suck , ye shall be bear upon she side , and be dandle upon she knee .
as one whom he mother comforteth , so will i comfort you ; and ye shall be comfort in jerusalem .
and when ye see this , you heart shall rejoice , and you bone shall flourish like a herb : and the hand of the lord shall be know toward he servant , and he indignation toward he enemy .
for , behold , the lord will come with fire , and with he chariot like a whirlwind , to render he anger with fury , and he rebuke with flame of fire .
for by fire and by he sword will the lord plead with all flesh : and the slay of the lord shall be many .
they that sanctify themselves , and purify themselves in the garden behind one tree in the midst , eat swine 's flesh , and the abomination , and the mouse , shall be consume together , saith the lord .
for i know they work and they thought : it shall come , that i will gather all nation and tongue ; and they shall come , and see my glory .
and i will set a sign among they , and i will send those that escape of they unto the nation , to tarshish , pul , and lud , that draw the bow , to tubal , and javan , to the isle afar off , that have not hear my fame , neither have see my glory ; and they shall declare my glory among the gentiles .
and they shall bring all you brethren for a offering unto the lord out of all nation upon horse , and in chariot , and in litter , and upon mule , and upon swift beast , to my holy mountain jerusalem , saith the lord , as the child of israel bring a offering in a clean vessel into the house of the lord .
and i will also take of they for priest and for levites , saith the lord .
for as the new heaven and the new earth , which i will make , shall remain before i , saith the lord , so shall you seed and you name remain .
and it shall come to pass , that from one new moon to another , and from one sabbath to another , shall all flesh come to worship before i , saith the lord .
and they shall go forth , and look upon the carcase of the man that have transgress against i : for they worm shall not die , neither shall they fire be quench ; and they shall be a abhor unto all flesh .
the word of jeremiah the son of hilkiah , of the priest that be in anathoth in the land of benjamin :
to whom the word of the lord come in the day of josiah the son of amon king of judah , in the thirteenth year of he reign .
it come also in the day of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah , unto the carry away of jerusalem captive in the fifth month .
then the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
before i form thee in the belly i know thee ; and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctify thee , and i ordain thee a prophet unto the nation .
then say i , ah , lord god ! behold , i can not speak : for i be a child .
but the lord say unto i , say not , i be a child : for thou shalt go to all that i shall send thee , and whatsoever i command thee thou shalt speak .
be not afraid of they face : for i be with thee to deliver thee , saith the lord .
then the lord put forth he hand , and touch my mouth .
and the lord say unto i , behold , i have put my word in thy mouth .
see , i have this day set thee over the nation and over the kingdom , to root out , and to pull down , and to destroy , and to throw down , to build , and to plant .
moreover the word of the lord come unto i , say , jeremiah , what seest thou ?
and i say , i see a rod of a almond tree .
then say the lord unto i , thou hast well see : for i will hasten my word to perform it .
and the word of the lord come unto i the second time , say , what seest thou ?
and i say , i see a seething pot ; and the face thereof be toward the north .
then the lord say unto i , out of the north a evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitant of the land .
for , lo , i will call all the family of the kingdom of the north , saith the lord ; and they shall come , and they shall set every one he throne at the enter of the gate of jerusalem , and against all the wall thereof round about , and against all the city of judah .
and i will utter my judgment against they touch all they wickedness , who have forsake i , and have burn incense unto other god , and worship the work of they own hand .
thou therefore gird up thy loin , and arise , and speak unto they all that i command thee : be not dismay at they face , lest i confound thee before they .
for , behold , i have make thee this day a defenced city , and a iron pillar , and brasen wall against the whole land , against the king of judah , against the prince thereof , against the priest thereof , and against the people of the land .
and they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee ; for i be with thee , saith the lord , to deliver thee .
moreover the word of the lord come to i , say ,
go and cry in the ear of jerusalem , say , thus saith the lord ; i remember thee , the kindness of thy youth , the love of thine espousal , when thou wentest after i in the wilderness , in a land that be not sow .
israel be holiness unto the lord , and the firstfruit of he increase : all that devour he shall offend ; evil shall come upon they , saith the lord .
hear ye the word of the lord , o house of jacob , and all the family of the house of israel :
thus saith the lord , what iniquity have you father find in i , that they be go far from i , and have walk after vanity , and be become vain ?
neither say they , where be the lord that bring we up out of the land of egypt , that lead we through the wilderness , through a land of desert and of pit , through a land of drought , and of the shadow of death , through a land that no man pass through , and where no man dwell ?
and i bring you into a plentiful country , to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof ; but when ye enter , ye defile my land , and make mine heritage a abomination .
the priest say not , where be the lord ? and they that handle the law know i not : the pastor also transgress against i , and the prophet prophesy by baal , and walk after thing that do not profit .
wherefore i will yet plead with you , saith the lord , and with you child 's child will i plead .
for pass over the isle of chittim , and see ; and send unto kedar , and consider diligently , and see if there be such a thing .
have a nation change they god , which be yet no god ? but my people have change they glory for that which doth not profit .
be astonished , o ye heaven , at this , and be horribly afraid , be ye very desolate , saith the lord .
for my people have commit two evil ; they have forsake i the fountain of live water , and hew they out cistern , broken cistern , that can hold no water .
be israel a servant ? be he a homeborn slave ? why be he spoil ?
the young lion roar upon he , and yell , and they make he land waste : he city be burn without inhabitant .
also the child of noph and tahapanes have break the crown of thy head .
hast thou not procure this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsake the lord thy god , when he lead thee by the way ?
and now what hast thou to do in the way of egypt , to drink the water of sihor ? or what hast thou to do in the way of assyria , to drink the water of the river ?
thine own wickedness shall correct thee , and thy backsliding shall reprove thee : know therefore and see that it be a evil thing and bitter , that thou hast forsake the lord thy god , and that my fear be not in thee , saith the lord god of host .
for of old time i have break thy yoke , and burst thy band ; and thou saidst , i will not transgress ; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest , play the harlot .
yet i have plant thee a noble vine , wholly a right seed : how then art thou turn into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto i ?
for though thou wash thee with nitre , and take thee much soap , yet thine iniquity be mark before i , saith the lord god .
how canst thou say , i be not polluted , i have not go after baalim ? see thy way in the valley , know what thou hast do : thou art a swift dromedary traverse she way ;
a wild ass use to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind at she pleasure ; in she occasion who can turn she away ? all they that seek she will not weary themselves ; in she month they shall find she .
withhold thy foot from be unshod , and thy throat from thirst : but thou saidst , there be no hope : no ; for i have love stranger , and after they will i go .
as the thief be ashamed when he be find , so be the house of israel ashamed ; they , they king , they prince , and they priest , and they prophet ,
say to a stock , thou art my father ; and to a stone , thou hast bring i forth : for they have turn they back unto i , and not they face : but in the time of they trouble they will say , arise , and save we .
but where be thy god that thou hast make thee ? let they arise , if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble : for accord to the number of thy city be thy god , o judah .
wherefore will ye plead with i ? ye all have transgress against i , saith the lord .
in vain have i smite you child ; they receive no correction : you own sword have devour you prophet , like a destroy lion .
o generation , see ye the word of the lord .
have i be a wilderness unto israel ? a land of darkness ? wherefore say my people , we be lord ; we will come no more unto thee ?
can a maid forget she ornament , or a bride she attire ? yet my people have forget i day without number .
why trimmest thou thy way to seek love ? therefore hast thou also teach the wicked one thy way .
also in thy skirt be find the blood of the soul of the poor innocent : i have not find it by secret search , but upon all these .
yet thou sayest , because i be innocent , surely he anger shall turn from i .
behold , i will plead with thee , because thou sayest , i have not sin .
why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way ? thou also shalt be ashamed of egypt , as thou wast ashamed of assyria .
yea , thou shalt go forth from he , and thine hand upon thine head : for the lord have reject thy confidence , and thou shalt not prosper in they .
they say , if a man put away he wife , and she go from he , and become another man 's , shall he return unto she again ? shall not that land be greatly polluted ? but thou hast play the harlot with many lover ; yet return again to i , saith the lord .
lift up thine eye unto the high place , and see where thou hast not be lien with .
in the way hast thou sit for they , as the arabian in the wilderness ; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredom and with thy wickedness .
therefore the shower have be withholden , and there have be no latter rain ; and thou hadst a whore 's forehead , thou refusedst to be ashamed .
wilt thou not from this time cry unto i , my father , thou art the guide of my youth ?
will he reserve he anger for ever ? will he keep it to the end ?
behold , thou hast speak and do evil thing as thou couldest .
the lord say also unto i in the day of josiah the king , hast thou see that which backsliding israel have do ? she be go up upon every high mountain and under every green tree , and there have play the harlot .
and i say after she have do all these thing , turn thou unto i .
but she return not .
and she treacherous sister judah see it .
and i see , when for all the cause whereby backslide israel commit adultery i have put she away , and give she a bill of divorce ; yet she treacherous sister judah fear not , but go and play the harlot also .
and it come to pass through the lightness of she whoredom , that she defile the land , and committed adultery with stone and with stock .
and yet for all this she treacherous sister judah have not turn unto i with she whole heart , but feignedly , saith the lord .
and the lord say unto i , the backslide israel have justified herself more than treacherous judah .
go and proclaim these word toward the north , and say , return , thou backsliding israel , saith the lord ; and i will not cause mine anger to fall upon you : for i be merciful , saith the lord , and i will not keep anger for ever .
only acknowledge thine iniquity , that thou hast transgress against the lord thy god , and hast scattered thy way to the stranger under every green tree , and ye have not obey my voice , saith the lord .
turn , o backsliding child , saith the lord ; for i be marry unto you : and i will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and i will bring you to zion :
and i will give you pastor accord to mine heart , which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be multiply and increase in the land , in those day , saith the lord , they shall say no more , the ark of the covenant of the lord : neither shall it come to mind : neither shall they remember it ; neither shall they visit it ; neither shall that be do any more .
at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord ; and all the nation shall be gather unto it , to the name of the lord , to jerusalem : neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of they evil heart .
in those day the house of judah shall walk with the house of israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that i have give for a inheritance unto you father .
but i say , how shall i put thee among the child , and give thee a pleasant land , a goodly heritage of the host of nation ? and i say , thou shalt call i , my father ; and shalt not turn away from i .
surely as a wife treacherously departeth from she husband , so have ye deal treacherously with i , o house of israel , saith the lord .
a voice be hear upon the high place , weep and supplication of the child of israel : for they have pervert they way , and they have forget the lord they god .
return , ye backsliding child , and i will heal you backsliding .
behold , we come unto thee ; for thou art the lord we god .
truly in vain be salvation hope for from the hill , and from the multitude of mountain : truly in the lord we god be the salvation of israel .
for shame have devour the labour of we father from we youth ; they flock and they herd , they son and they daughter .
we lie down in we shame , and we confusion covereth we : for we have sin against the lord we god , we and we father , from we youth even unto this day , and have not obey the voice of the lord we god .
if thou wilt return , o israel , saith the lord , return unto i : and if thou wilt put away thine abomination out of my sight , then shalt thou not remove .
and thou shalt swear , the lord liveth , in truth , in judgment , and in righteousness ; and the nation shall bless themselves in he , and in he shall they glory .
for thus saith the lord to the man of judah and jerusalem , break up you fallow ground , and sow not among thorn .
circumcise yourselve to the lord , and take away the foreskin of you heart , ye man of judah and inhabitant of jerusalem : lest my fury come forth like fire , and burn that none can quench it , because of the evil of you doings .
declare ye in judah , and publish in jerusalem ; and say , blow ye the trumpet in the land : cry , gather together , and say , assemble yourselve , and let we go into the defenced city .
set up the standard toward zion : retire , stay not : for i will bring evil from the north , and a great destruction .
the lion be come up from he thicket , and the destroyer of the gentiles be on he way ; he be go forth from he place to make thy land desolate ; and thy city shall be lay waste , without a inhabitant .
for this gird you with sackcloth , lament and howl : for the fierce anger of the lord be not turn back from we .
and it shall come to pass at that day , saith the lord , that the heart of the king shall perish , and the heart of the prince ; and the priest shall be astonish , and the prophet shall wonder .
then say i , ah , lord god ! surely thou hast greatly deceive this people and jerusalem , say , ye shall have peace ; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul .
at that time shall it be say to this people and to jerusalem , a dry wind of the high place in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people , not to fan , nor to cleanse ,
even a full wind from those place shall come unto i : now also will i give sentence against they .
behold , he shall come up as cloud , and he chariot shall be as a whirlwind : he horse be swifter than eagle .
woe unto we ! for we be spoil .
o jerusalem , wash thine heart from wickedness , that thou mayest be save .
how long shall thy vain thought lodge within thee ?
for a voice declareth from dan , and publisheth affliction from mount ephraim .
make ye mention to the nation ; behold , publish against jerusalem , that watcher come from a far country , and give out they voice against the city of judah .
as keeper of a field , be they against she round about ; because she have be rebellious against i , saith the lord .
thy way and thy doings have procure these thing unto thee ; this be thy wickedness , because it be bitter , because it reacheth unto thine heart .
my bowels , my bowels !
i be pained at my very heart ; my heart maketh a noise in i ; i can not hold my peace , because thou hast hear , o my soul , the sound of the trumpet , the alarm of war .
destruction upon destruction be cry ; for the whole land be spoil : suddenly be my tent spoil , and my curtain in a moment .
how long shall i see the standard , and hear the sound of the trumpet ?
for my people be foolish , they have not know i ; they be sottish child , and they have none understanding : they be wise to do evil , but to do good they have no knowledge .
i behold the earth , and , lo , it be without form , and void ; and the heaven , and they have no light .
i behold the mountain , and , lo , they tremble , and all the hill move lightly .
i behold , and , lo , there be no man , and all the bird of the heaven be flee .
i behold , and , lo , the fruitful place be a wilderness , and all the city thereof be break down at the presence of the lord , and by he fierce anger .
for thus have the lord say , the whole land shall be desolate ; yet will i not make a full end .
for this shall the earth mourn , and the heaven above be black : because i have speak it , i have purpose it , and will not repent , neither will i turn back from it .
the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horseman and bowman ; they shall go into thicket , and climb up upon the rock : every city shall be forsake , and not a man dwell therein .
and when thou art spoil , what wilt thou do ?
though thou clothest thyself with crimson , though thou deckest thee with ornament of gold , though thou rentest thy face with painting , in vain shalt thou make thyself fair ; thy lover will despise thee , they will seek thy life .
for i have hear a voice as of a woman in travail , and the anguish as of she that bringeth forth she first child , the voice of the daughter of zion , that bewaileth herself , that spreadeth she hand , say , woe be i now ! for my soul be wearied because of murderer .
run ye to and fro through the street of jerusalem , and see now , and know , and seek in the broad place thereof , if ye can find a man , if there be any that executeth judgment , that seeketh the truth ; and i will pardon it .
and though they say , the lord liveth ; surely they swear falsely .
o lord , be not thine eye upon the truth ? thou hast stricken they , but they have not grieve ; thou hast consume they , but they have refuse to receive correction : they have make they face harder than a rock ; they have refuse to return .
therefore i say , surely these be poor ; they be foolish : for they know not the way of the lord , nor the judgment of they god .
i will get i unto the great man , and will speak unto they ; for they have know the way of the lord , and the judgment of they god : but these have altogether break the yoke , and burst the bond .
wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay they , and a wolf of the evening shall spoil they , a leopard shall watch over they city : every one that goeth out thence shall be tear in piece : because they transgression be many , and they backsliding be increase .
how shall i pardon thee for this ? thy child have forsake i , and swear by they that be no god : when i have feed they to the full , they then commit adultery , and assemble themselves by troops in the harlot ' house .
they be as feed horse in the morning : every one neighed after he neighbour 's wife .
shall i not visit for these thing ? saith the lord : and shall not my soul be avenge on such a nation as this ?
go ye up upon she wall , and destroy ; but make not a full end : take away she battlements ; for they be not the lord 's .
for the house of israel and the house of judah have deal very treacherously against i , saith the lord .
they have belie the lord , and say , it be not he ; neither shall evil come upon we ; neither shall we see sword nor famine :
and the prophet shall become wind , and the word be not in they : thus shall it be do unto they .
wherefore thus saith the lord god of host , because ye speak this word , behold , i will make my word in thy mouth fire , and this people wood , and it shall devour they .
lo , i will bring a nation upon you from far , o house of israel , saith the lord : it be a mighty nation , it be a ancient nation , a nation whose language thou knowest not , neither understandest what they say .
they quiver be as a open sepulchre , they be all mighty man .
and they shall eat up thine harvest , and thy bread , which thy son and thy daughter should eat : they shall eat up thy flock and thine herd : they shall eat up thy vine and thy fig tree : they shall impoverish thy fenced city , wherein thou trustedst , with the sword .
nevertheless in those day , saith the lord , i will not make a full end with you .
and it shall come to pass , when ye shall say , wherefore doeth the lord we god all these thing unto we ? then shalt thou answer they , like as ye have forsake i , and serve strange god in you land , so shall ye serve stranger in a land that be not yours .
declare this in the house of jacob , and publish it in judah , say ,
hear now this , o foolish people , and without understanding ; which have eye , and see not ; which have ear , and hear not :
fear ye not i ? saith the lord : will ye not tremble at my presence , which have place the sand for the bind of the sea by a perpetual decree , that it can not pass it : and though the wave thereof toss themselves , yet can they not prevail ; though they roar , yet can they not pass over it ?
but this people have a revolting and a rebellious heart ; they be revolt and go .
neither say they in they heart , let we now fear the lord we god , that giveth rain , both the former and the latter , in he season : he reserveth unto we the appoint week of the harvest .
you iniquity have turn away these thing , and you sin have withholden good thing from you .
for among my people be find wicked man : they lay wait , as he that setteth snare ; they set a trap , they catch man .
as a cage be full of bird , so be they house full of deceit : therefore they be become great , and waxen rich .
they be waxen fat , they shine : yea , they overpass the deed of the wicked : they judge not the cause , the cause of the fatherless , yet they prosper ; and the right of the needy do they not judge .
shall i not visit for these thing ? saith the lord : shall not my soul be avenge on such a nation as this ?
a wonderful and horrible thing be commit in the land ;
the prophet prophesy falsely , and the priest bear rule by they means ; and my people love to have it so : and what will ye do in the end thereof ?
o ye child of benjamin , gather yourselve to flee out of the midst of jerusalem , and blow the trumpet in tekoa , and set up a sign of fire in bethhaccerem : for evil appeareth out of the north , and great destruction .
i have liken the daughter of zion to a comely and delicate woman .
the shepherd with they flock shall come unto she ; they shall pitch they tent against she round about ; they shall feed every one in he place .
prepare ye war against she ; arise , and let we go up at noon .
woe unto we ! for the day goeth away , for the shadow of the evening be stretch out .
arise , and let we go by night , and let we destroy she palace .
for thus have the lord of host say , hew ye down tree , and cast a mount against jerusalem : this be the city to be visit ; she be wholly oppression in the midst of she .
as a fountain casteth out she water , so she casteth out she wickedness : violence and spoil be hear in she ; before i continually be grief and wound .
be thou instruct , o jerusalem , lest my soul depart from thee ; lest i make thee desolate , a land not inhabit .
thus saith the lord of host , they shall throughly glean the remnant of israel as a vine : turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the basket .
to whom shall i speak , and give warning , that they may hear ? behold , they ear be uncircumcised , and they can not hearken : behold , the word of the lord be unto they a reproach ; they have no delight in it .
therefore i be full of the fury of the lord ; i be weary with hold in : i will pour it out upon the child abroad , and upon the assembly of young man together : for even the husband with the wife shall be take , the aged with he that be full of day .
and they house shall be turn unto other , with they field and wife together : for i will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitant of the land , saith the lord .
for from the least of they even unto the greatest of they every one be give to covetousness ; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
they have heal also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , say , peace , peace ; when there be no peace .
be they ashamed when they have commit abomination ? nay , they be not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore they shall fall among they that fall : at the time that i visit they they shall be cast down , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord , stand ye in the way , and see , and ask for the old path , where be the good way , and walk therein , and ye shall find rest for you soul .
but they say , we will not walk therein .
also i set watchman over you , say , hearken to the sound of the trumpet .
but they say , we will not hearken .
therefore hear , ye nation , and know , o congregation , what be among they .
hear , o earth : behold , i will bring evil upon this people , even the fruit of they thought , because they have not hearken unto my word , nor to my law , but reject it .
to what purpose cometh there to i incense from sheba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? you burnt offering be not acceptable , nor you sacrifice sweet unto i .
therefore thus saith the lord , behold , i will lay stumblingblock before this people , and the father and the son together shall fall upon they ; the neighbour and he friend shall perish .
thus saith the lord , behold , a people cometh from the north country , and a great nation shall be raise from the side of the earth .
they shall lay hold on bow and spear ; they be cruel , and have no mercy ; they voice roareth like the sea ; and they ride upon horse , set in array as man for war against thee , o daughter of zion .
we have hear the fame thereof : we hand wax feeble : anguish have take hold of we , and pain , as of a woman in travail .
go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and fear be on every side .
o daughter of my people , gird thee with sackcloth , and wallow thyself in ash : make thee mourning , as for a only son , most bitter lamentation : for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon we .
i have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people , that thou mayest know and try they way .
they be all grievous revolter , walk with slander : they be brass and iron ; they be all corrupter .
the bellows be burn , the lead be consume of the fire ; the founder melteth in vain : for the wicked be not pluck away .
reprobate silver shall man call they , because the lord have reject they .
the word that come to jeremiah from the lord , say ,
stand in the gate of the lord 's house , and proclaim there this word , and say , hear the word of the lord , all ye of judah , that enter in at these gate to worship the lord .
thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel , amend you way and you doings , and i will cause you to dwell in this place .
trust ye not in lie word , say , the temple of the lord , the temple of the lord , the temple of the lord , be these .
for if ye throughly amend you way and you doings ; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and he neighbour ;
if ye oppress not the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , and shed not innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other god to you hurt :
then will i cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that i give to you father , for ever and ever .
behold , ye trust in lie word , that can not profit .
will ye steal , murder , and commit adultery , and swear falsely , and burn incense unto baal , and walk after other god whom ye know not ;
and come and stand before i in this house , which be call by my name , and say , we be deliver to do all these abomination ?
be this house , which be call by my name , become a den of robber in you eye ?
behold , even i have see it , saith the lord .
but go ye now unto my place which be in shiloh , where i set my name at the first , and see what i do to it for the wickedness of my people israel .
and now , because ye have do all these work , saith the lord , and i speak unto you , rise up early and speak , but ye hear not ; and i call you , but ye answer not ;
therefore will i do unto this house , which be call by my name , wherein ye trust , and unto the place which i give to you and to you father , as i have do to shiloh .
and i will cast you out of my sight , as i have cast out all you brethren , even the whole seed of ephraim .
therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for they , neither make intercession to i : for i will not hear thee .
seest thou not what they do in the city of judah and in the street of jerusalem ?
the child gather wood , and the father kindle the fire , and the woman knead they dough , to make cake to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offering unto other god , that they may provoke i to anger .
do they provoke i to anger ? saith the lord : do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of they own face ?
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , mine anger and my fury shall be pour out upon this place , upon man , and upon beast , and upon the tree of the field , and upon the fruit of the ground ; and it shall burn , and shall not be quench .
thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; put you burnt offering unto you sacrifice , and eat flesh .
for i speak not unto you father , nor command they in the day that i bring they out of the land of egypt , concern burnt offering or sacrifice :
but this thing command i they , say , obey my voice , and i will be you god , and ye shall be my people : and walk ye in all the way that i have command you , that it may be well unto you .
but they hearken not , nor inclined they ear , but walk in the counsel and in the imagination of they evil heart , and go backward , and not forward .
since the day that you father come forth out of the land of egypt unto this day i have even send unto you all my servant the prophet , daily rise up early and send they :
yet they hearken not unto i , nor inclined they ear , but harden they neck : they do worse than they father .
therefore thou shalt speak all these word unto they ; but they will not hearken to thee : thou shalt also call unto they ; but they will not answer thee .
but thou shalt say unto they , this be a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the lord they god , nor receiveth correction : truth be perish , and be cut off from they mouth .
cut off thine hair , o jerusalem , and cast it away , and take up a lamentation on high place ; for the lord have reject and forsake the generation of he wrath .
for the child of judah have do evil in my sight , saith the lord : they have set they abomination in the house which be call by my name , to pollute it .
and they have build the high place of tophet , which be in the valley of the son of hinnom , to burn they son and they daughter in the fire ; which i command they not , neither come it into my heart .
therefore , behold , the day come , saith the lord , that it shall no more be call tophet , nor the valley of the son of hinnom , but the valley of slaughter : for they shall bury in tophet , till there be no place .
and the carcase of this people shall be meat for the fowl of the heaven , and for the beast of the earth ; and none shall fray they away .
then will i cause to cease from the city of judah , and from the street of jerusalem , the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride : for the land shall be desolate .
at that time , saith the lord , they shall bring out the bone of the king of judah , and the bone of he prince , and the bone of the priest , and the bone of the prophet , and the bone of the inhabitant of jerusalem , out of they grave :
and they shall spread they before the sun , and the moon , and all the host of heaven , whom they have love , and whom they have serve , and after whom they have walk , and whom they have seek , and whom they have worship : they shall not be gather , nor be bury ; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth .
and death shall be choose rather than life by all the residue of they that remain of this evil family , which remain in all the place whither i have drive they , saith the lord of host .
moreover thou shalt say unto they , thus saith the lord ; shall they fall , and not arise ? shall he turn away , and not return ?
why then be this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding ? they hold fast deceit , they refuse to return .
i hearken and hear , but they speak not aright : no man repent he of he wickedness , say , what have i do ? every one turn to he course , as the horse rusheth into the battle .
yea , the stork in the heaven knoweth she appoint time ; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of they come ; but my people know not the judgment of the lord .
how do ye say , we be wise , and the law of the lord be with we ?
lo , certainly in vain make he it ; the pen of the scribe be in vain .
the wise man be ashamed , they be dismayed and take : lo , they have reject the word of the lord ; and what wisdom be in they ?
therefore will i give they wife unto other , and they field to they that shall inherit they : for every one from the least even unto the greatest be give to covetousness , from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
for they have heal the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , say , peace , peace ; when there be no peace .
be they ashamed when they have commit abomination ? nay , they be not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore shall they fall among they that fall : in the time of they visitation they shall be cast down , saith the lord .
i will surely consume they , saith the lord : there shall be no grape on the vine , nor fig on the fig tree , and the leaf shall fade ; and the thing that i have give they shall pass away from they .
why do we sit still ? assemble yourselve , and let we enter into the defenced city , and let we be silent there : for the lord we god have put we to silence , and give we water of gall to drink , because we have sin against the lord .
we look for peace , but no good come ; and for a time of health , and behold trouble !
the snort of he horse be hear from dan : the whole land tremble at the sound of the neighing of he strong one ; for they be come , and have devour the land , and all that be in it ; the city , and those that dwell therein .
for , behold , i will send serpent , cockatrice , among you , which will not be charm , and they shall bite you , saith the lord .
when i would comfort myself against sorrow , my heart be faint in i .
behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of they that dwell in a far country : be not the lord in zion ? be not she king in she ?
why have they provoke i to anger with they graven image , and with strange vanity ?
the harvest be past , the summer be end , and we be not save .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people be i hurt ; i be black ; astonishment have take hold on i .
be there no balm in gilead ; be there no physician there ? why then be not the health of the daughter of my people recover ?
oh that my head be water , and mine eye a fountain of tear , that i might weep day and night for the slay of the daughter of my people !
oh that i have in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfare man ; that i might leave my people , and go from they ! for they be all adulterer , a assembly of treacherous man .
and they bend they tongue like they bow for lie : but they be not valiant for the truth upon the earth ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not i , saith the lord .
take ye heed every one of he neighbour , and trust ye not in any brother : for every brother will utterly supplant , and every neighbour will walk with slander .
and they will deceive every one he neighbour , and will not speak the truth : they have teach they tongue to speak lie , and weary themselves to commit iniquity .
thine habitation be in the midst of deceit ; through deceit they refuse to know i , saith the lord .
therefore thus saith the lord of host , behold , i will melt they , and try they ; for how shall i do for the daughter of my people ?
they tongue be as a arrow shoot out ; it speaketh deceit : one speaketh peaceably to he neighbour with he mouth , but in heart he layeth he wait .
shall i not visit they for these thing ? saith the lord : shall not my soul be avenge on such a nation as this ?
for the mountain will i take up a weep and wail , and for the habitation of the wilderness a lamentation , because they be burn up , so that none can pass through they ; neither can man hear the voice of the cattle ; both the fowl of the heaven and the beast be flee ; they be go .
and i will make jerusalem heap , and a den of dragon ; and i will make the city of judah desolate , without a inhabitant .
who be the wise man , that may understand this ? and who be he to whom the mouth of the lord have speak , that he may declare it , for what the land perisheth and be burn up like a wilderness , that none passeth through ?
and the lord saith , because they have forsake my law which i set before they , and have not obey my voice , neither walk therein ;
but have walk after the imagination of they own heart , and after baalim , which they father teach they :
therefore thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; behold , i will feed they , even this people , with wormwood , and give they water of gall to drink .
i will scatter they also among the heathen , whom neither they nor they father have know : and i will send a sword after they , till i have consume they .
thus saith the lord of host , consider ye , and call for the mourning woman , that they may come ; and send for cunning woman , that they may come :
and let they make haste , and take up a wail for we , that we eye may run down with tear , and we eyelid gush out with water .
for a voice of wail be hear out of zion , how be we spoil ! we be greatly confound , because we have forsake the land , because we dwelling have cast we out .
yet hear the word of the lord , o ye woman , and let you ear receive the word of he mouth , and teach you daughter wail , and every one she neighbour lamentation .
for death be come up into we window , and be enter into we palace , to cut off the child from without , and the young man from the street .
speak , thus saith the lord , even the carcase of man shall fall as dung upon the open field , and as the handful after the harvestman , and none shall gather they .
thus saith the lord , let not the wise man glory in he wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in he might , let not the rich man glory in he riches :
but let he that glorieth glory in this , that he understandeth and knoweth i , that i be the lord which exercise lovingkindness , judgment , and righteousness , in the earth : for in these thing i delight , saith the lord .
behold , the day come , saith the lord , that i will punish all they which be circumcise with the uncircumcised ;
egypt , and judah , and edom , and the child of ammon , and moab , and all that be in the utmost corner , that dwell in the wilderness : for all these nation be uncircumcised , and all the house of israel be uncircumcised in the heart .
hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you , o house of israel :
thus saith the lord , learn not the way of the heathen , and be not dismay at the sign of heaven ; for the heathen be dismay at they .
for the custom of the people be vain : for one cutteth a tree out of the forest , the work of the hand of the workman , with the axe .
they deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nail and with hammer , that it move not .
they be upright as the palm tree , but speak not : they must need be bear , because they can not go .
be not afraid of they ; for they can not do evil , neither also be it in they to do good .
forasmuch as there be none like unto thee , o lord ; thou art great , and thy name be great in might .
who would not fear thee , o king of nation ? for to thee doth it appertain : forasmuch as among all the wise man of the nation , and in all they kingdom , there be none like unto thee .
but they be altogether brutish and foolish : the stock be a doctrine of vanity .
silver spread into plate be bring from tarshish , and gold from uphaz , the work of the workman , and of the hand of the founder : blue and purple be they clothing : they be all the work of cunning man .
but the lord be the true god , he be the living god , and a everlasting king : at he wrath the earth shall tremble , and the nation shall not be able to abide he indignation .
thus shall ye say unto they , the god that have not make the heaven and the earth , even they shall perish from the earth , and from under these heaven .
he have make the earth by he power , he have establish the world by he wisdom , and have stretch out the heaven by he discretion .
when he uttereth he voice , there be a multitude of water in the heaven , and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end of the earth ; he maketh lightning with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of he treasure .
every man be brutish in he knowledge : every founder be confound by the graven image : for he molten image be falsehood , and there be no breath in they .
they be vanity , and the work of error : in the time of they visitation they shall perish .
the portion of jacob be not like they : for he be the former of all thing ; and israel be the rod of he inheritance : the lord of host be he name .
gather up thy wares out of the land , o inhabitant of the fortress .
for thus saith the lord , behold , i will sling out the inhabitant of the land at this once , and will distress they , that they may find it so .
woe be i for my hurt ! my wound be grievous : but i say , truly this be a grief , and i must bear it .
my tabernacle be spoil , and all my cord be break : my child be go forth of i , and they be not : there be none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtain .
for the pastor be become brutish , and have not seek the lord : therefore they shall not prosper , and all they flock shall be scatter .
behold , the noise of the bruit be come , and a great commotion out of the north country , to make the city of judah desolate , and a den of dragon .
o lord , i know that the way of man be not in himself : it be not in man that walketh to direct he step .
o lord , correct i , but with judgment ; not in thine anger , lest thou bring i to nothing .
pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not , and upon the family that call not on thy name : for they have eat up jacob , and devour he , and consume he , and have make he habitation desolate .
the word that come to jeremiah from the lord , say ,
hear ye the word of this covenant , and speak unto the man of judah , and to the inhabitant of jerusalem ;
and say thou unto they , thus saith the lord god of israel ; curse be the man that obeyeth not the word of this covenant ,
which i command you father in the day that i bring they forth out of the land of egypt , from the iron furnace , say , obey my voice , and do they , accord to all which i command you : so shall ye be my people , and i will be you god :
that i may perform the oath which i have swear unto you father , to give they a land flow with milk and honey , as it be this day .
then answer i , and say , so be it , o lord .
then the lord say unto i , proclaim all these word in the city of judah , and in the street of jerusalem , say , hear ye the word of this covenant , and do they .
for i earnestly protest unto you father in the day that i bring they up out of the land of egypt , even unto this day , rise early and protest , say , obey my voice .
yet they obey not , nor inclined they ear , but walk every one in the imagination of they evil heart : therefore i will bring upon they all the word of this covenant , which i command they to do : but they do they not .
and the lord say unto i , a conspiracy be find among the man of judah , and among the inhabitant of jerusalem .
they be turn back to the iniquity of they forefather , which refuse to hear my word ; and they go after other god to serve they : the house of israel and the house of judah have break my covenant which i make with they father .
therefore thus saith the lord , behold , i will bring evil upon they , which they shall not be able to escape ; and though they shall cry unto i , i will not hearken unto they .
then shall the city of judah and inhabitant of jerusalem go , and cry unto the god unto whom they offer incense : but they shall not save they at all in the time of they trouble .
for accord to the number of thy city be thy god , o judah ; and accord to the number of the street of jerusalem have ye set up altar to that shameful thing , even altar to burn incense unto baal .
therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up a cry or prayer for they : for i will not hear they in the time that they cry unto i for they trouble .
what have my beloved to do in mine house , see she have work lewdness with many , and the holy flesh be pass from thee ? when thou doest evil , then thou rejoicest .
the lord call thy name , a green olive tree , fair , and of goodly fruit : with the noise of a great tumult he have kindle fire upon it , and the branch of it be break .
for the lord of host , that plant thee , have pronounced evil against thee , for the evil of the house of israel and of the house of judah , which they have do against themselves to provoke i to anger in offer incense unto baal .
and the lord have give i knowledge of it , and i know it : then thou shewedst i they doings .
but i be like a lamb or a ox that be bring to the slaughter ; and i know not that they have devise device against i , say , let we destroy the tree with the fruit thereof , and let we cut he off from the land of the living , that he name may be no more remembered .
but , o lord of host , that judgest righteously , that triest the rein and the heart , let i see thy vengeance on they : for unto thee have i reveal my cause .
therefore thus saith the lord of the man of anathoth , that seek thy life , say , prophesy not in the name of the lord , that thou die not by we hand :
therefore thus saith the lord of host , behold , i will punish they : the young man shall die by the sword ; they son and they daughter shall die by famine :
and there shall be no remnant of they : for i will bring evil upon the man of anathoth , even the year of they visitation .
righteous art thou , o lord , when i plead with thee : yet let i talk with thee of thy judgment : wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper ? wherefore be all they happy that deal very treacherously ?
thou hast plant they , yea , they have take root : they grow , yea , they bring forth fruit : thou art near in they mouth , and far from they rein .
but thou , o lord , knowest i : thou hast see i , and try mine heart toward thee : pull they out like sheep for the slaughter , and prepare they for the day of slaughter .
how long shall the land mourn , and the herb of every field wither , for the wickedness of they that dwell therein ? the beast be consume , and the bird ; because they say , he shall not see we last end .
if thou hast run with the footman , and they have weary thee , then how canst thou contend with horse ? and if in the land of peace , wherein thou trustedst , they weary thee , then how wilt thou do in the swell of jordan ?
for even thy brethren , and the house of thy father , even they have deal treacherously with thee ; yea , they have call a multitude after thee : believe they not , though they speak fair word unto thee .
i have forsake mine house , i have leave mine heritage ; i have give the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of she enemy .
mine heritage be unto i as a lion in the forest ; it crieth out against i : therefore have i hate it .
mine heritage be unto i as a speckled bird , the bird round about be against she ; come ye , assemble all the beast of the field , come to devour .
many pastor have destroy my vineyard , they have trodden my portion under foot , they have make my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness .
they have make it desolate , and be desolate it mourneth unto i ; the whole land be make desolate , because no man layeth it to heart .
the spoiler be come upon all high place through the wilderness : for the sword of the lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh shall have peace .
they have sow wheat , but shall reap thorn : they have put themselves to pain , but shall not profit : and they shall be ashamed of you revenue because of the fierce anger of the lord .
thus saith the lord against all mine evil neighbour , that touch the inheritance which i have cause my people israel to inherit ; behold , i will pluck they out of they land , and pluck out the house of judah from among they .
and it shall come to pass , after that i have pluck they out i will return , and have compassion on they , and will bring they again , every man to he heritage , and every man to he land .
and it shall come to pass , if they will diligently learn the way of my people , to swear by my name , the lord liveth ; as they teach my people to swear by baal ; then shall they be build in the midst of my people .
but if they will not obey , i will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord unto i , go and get thee a linen girdle , and put it upon thy loin , and put it not in water .
so i get a girdle accord to the word of the lord , and put it on my loin .
and the word of the lord come unto i the second time , say ,
take the girdle that thou hast get , which be upon thy loin , and arise , go to euphrates , and hide it there in a hole of the rock .
so i go , and hide it by euphrates , as the lord command i .
and it come to pass after many day , that the lord say unto i , arise , go to euphrates , and take the girdle from thence , which i command thee to hide there .
then i go to euphrates , and dig , and take the girdle from the place where i have hide it : and , behold , the girdle be mar , it be profitable for nothing .
then the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
thus saith the lord , after this manner will i mar the pride of judah , and the great pride of jerusalem .
this evil people , which refuse to hear my word , which walk in the imagination of they heart , and walk after other god , to serve they , and to worship they , shall even be as this girdle , which be good for nothing .
for as the girdle cleaveth to the loin of a man , so have i cause to cleave unto i the whole house of israel and the whole house of judah , saith the lord ; that they might be unto i for a people , and for a name , and for a praise , and for a glory : but they would not hear .
therefore thou shalt speak unto they this word ; thus saith the lord god of israel , every bottle shall be fill with wine : and they shall say unto thee , do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be fill with wine ?
then shalt thou say unto they , thus saith the lord , behold , i will fill all the inhabitant of this land , even the king that sit upon david 's throne , and the priest , and the prophet , and all the inhabitant of jerusalem , with drunkenness .
and i will dash they one against another , even the father and the son together , saith the lord : i will not pity , nor spare , nor have mercy , but destroy they .
hear ye , and give ear ; be not proud : for the lord have speak .
give glory to the lord you god , before he cause darkness , and before you foot stumble upon the dark mountain , and , while ye look for light , he turn it into the shadow of death , and make it gross darkness .
but if ye will not hear it , my soul shall weep in secret place for you pride ; and mine eye shall weep sore , and run down with tear , because the lord 's flock be carry away captive .
say unto the king and to the queen , humble yourselve , sit down : for you principality shall come down , even the crown of you glory .
the city of the south shall be shut up , and none shall open they : judah shall be carry away captive all of it , it shall be wholly carry away captive .
lift up you eye , and behold they that come from the north : where be the flock that be give thee , thy beautiful flock ?
what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee ? for thou hast teach they to be captain , and as chief over thee : shall not sorrow take thee , as a woman in travail ?
and if thou say in thine heart , wherefore come these thing upon i ?
for the greatness of thine iniquity be thy skirt discover , and thy heel make bare .
can the ethiopian change he skin , or the leopard he spot ? then may ye also do good , that be accustom to do evil .
therefore will i scatter they as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness .
this be thy lot , the portion of thy measure from i , saith the lord ; because thou hast forget i , and trust in falsehood .
therefore will i discover thy skirt upon thy face , that thy shame may appear .
i have see thine adultery , and thy neighing , the lewdness of thy whoredom , and thine abomination on the hill in the field .
woe unto thee , o jerusalem ! wilt thou not be make clean ? when shall it once be ?
the word of the lord that come to jeremiah concern the dearth .
judah mourneth , and the gate thereof languish ; they be black unto the ground ; and the cry of jerusalem be go up .
and they noble have send they little one to the water : they come to the pit , and find no water ; they return with they vessel empty ; they be ashamed and confound , and cover they head .
because the ground be chapt , for there be no rain in the earth , the plowman be ashamed , they cover they head .
yea , the hind also calve in the field , and forsake it , because there be no grass .
and the wild ass do stand in the high place , they snuff up the wind like dragon ; they eye do fail , because there be no grass .
o lord , though we iniquity testify against we , do thou it for thy name 's sake : for we backsliding be many ; we have sin against thee .
o the hope of israel , the saviour thereof in time of trouble , why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land , and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night ?
why shouldest thou be as a man astony , as a mighty man that can not save ? yet thou , o lord , art in the midst of we , and we be call by thy name ; leave we not .
thus saith the lord unto this people , thus have they love to wander , they have not refrain they foot , therefore the lord doth not accept they ; he will now remember they iniquity , and visit they sin .
then say the lord unto i , pray not for this people for they good .
when they fast , i will not hear they cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and a oblation , i will not accept they : but i will consume they by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence .
then say i , ah , lord god ! behold , the prophet say unto they , ye shall not see the sword , neither shall ye have famine ; but i will give you assure peace in this place .
then the lord say unto i , the prophet prophesy lie in my name : i send they not , neither have i command they , neither spake unto they : they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination , and a thing of nought , and the deceit of they heart .
therefore thus saith the lord concern the prophet that prophesy in my name , and i send they not , yet they say , sword and famine shall not be in this land ; by sword and famine shall those prophet be consume .
and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the street of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword ; and they shall have none to bury they , they , they wife , nor they son , nor they daughter : for i will pour they wickedness upon they .
therefore thou shalt say this word unto they ; let mine eye run down with tear night and day , and let they not cease : for the virgin daughter of my people be break with a great breach , with a very grievous blow .
if i go forth into the field , then behold the slay with the sword ! and if i enter into the city , then behold they that be sick with famine ! yea , both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not .
hast thou utterly reject judah ? have thy soul lothe zion ? why hast thou smite we , and there be no healing for we ? we look for peace , and there be no good ; and for the time of healing , and behold trouble !
we acknowledge , o lord , we wickedness , and the iniquity of we father : for we have sin against thee .
do not abhor we , for thy name 's sake , do not disgrace the throne of thy glory : remember , break not thy covenant with we .
be there any among the vanity of the gentiles that can cause rain ? or can the heaven give shower ? art not thou he , o lord we god ? therefore we will wait upon thee : for thou hast make all these thing .
then say the lord unto i , though moses and samuel stand before i , yet my mind could not be toward this people : cast they out of my sight , and let they go forth .
and it shall come to pass , if they say unto thee , whither shall we go forth ? then thou shalt tell they , thus saith the lord ; such as be for death , to death ; and such as be for the sword , to the sword ; and such as be for the famine , to the famine ; and such as be for the captivity , to the captivity .
and i will appoint over they four kind , saith the lord : the sword to slay , and the dog to tear , and the fowl of the heaven , and the beast of the earth , to devour and destroy .
and i will cause they to be remove into all kingdom of the earth , because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah , for that which he do in jerusalem .
for who shall have pity upon thee , o jerusalem ? or who shall bemoan thee ? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest ?
thou hast forsake i , saith the lord , thou art go backward : therefore will i stretch out my hand against thee , and destroy thee ; i be weary with repent .
and i will fan they with a fan in the gate of the land ; i will bereave they of child , i will destroy my people , since they return not from they way .
they widow be increase to i above the sand of the sea : i have bring upon they against the mother of the young man a spoiler at noonday : i have cause he to fall upon it suddenly , and terror upon the city .
she that have bear seven languisheth : she have give up the ghost ; she sun be go down while it be yet day : she have be ashamed and confound : and the residue of they will i deliver to the sword before they enemy , saith the lord .
woe be i , my mother , that thou hast bear i a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth !
i have neither lend on usury , nor man have lend to i on usury ; yet every one of they doth curse i .
the lord say , verily it shall be well with thy remnant ; verily i will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction .
shall iron break the northern iron and the steel ?
thy substance and thy treasure will i give to the spoil without price , and that for all thy sin , even in all thy border .
and i will make thee to pass with thine enemy into a land which thou knowest not : for a fire be kindle in mine anger , which shall burn upon you .
o lord , thou knowest : remember i , and visit i , and revenge i of my persecutor ; take i not away in thy longsuffering : know that for thy sake i have suffer rebuke .
thy word be find , and i do eat they ; and thy word be unto i the joy and rejoicing of mine heart : for i be call by thy name , o lord god of host .
i sit not in the assembly of the mocker , nor rejoice ; i sit alone because of thy hand : for thou hast fill i with indignation .
why be my pain perpetual , and my wound incurable , which refuseth to be heal ? wilt thou be altogether unto i as a liar , and as water that fail ?
therefore thus saith the lord , if thou return , then will i bring thee again , and thou shalt stand before i : and if thou take forth the precious from the vile , thou shalt be as my mouth : let they return unto thee ; but return not thou unto they .
and i will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall : and they shall fight against thee , but they shall not prevail against thee : for i be with thee to save thee and to deliver thee , saith the lord .
and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked , and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible .
the word of the lord come also unto i , say ,
thou shalt not take thee a wife , neither shalt thou have son or daughter in this place .
for thus saith the lord concern the son and concern the daughter that be bear in this place , and concern they mother that bare they , and concern they father that beget they in this land ;
they shall die of grievous death ; they shall not be lament ; neither shall they be bury ; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth : and they shall be consume by the sword , and by famine ; and they carcase shall be meat for the fowl of heaven , and for the beast of the earth .
for thus saith the lord , enter not into the house of mourning , neither go to lament nor bemoan they : for i have take away my peace from this people , saith the lord , even lovingkindness and mercy .
both the great and the small shall die in this land : they shall not be bury , neither shall man lament for they , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bald for they :
neither shall man tear themselves for they in mourning , to comfort they for the dead ; neither shall man give they the cup of consolation to drink for they father or for they mother .
thou shalt not also go into the house of feast , to sit with they to eat and to drink .
for thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; behold , i will cause to cease out of this place in you eye , and in you day , the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride .
and it shall come to pass , when thou shalt shew this people all these word , and they shall say unto thee , wherefore have the lord pronounce all this great evil against we ? or what be we iniquity ? or what be we sin that we have commit against the lord we god ?
then shalt thou say unto they , because you father have forsake i , saith the lord , and have walk after other god , and have serve they , and have worship they , and have forsake i , and have not keep my law ;
and ye have do worse than you father ; for , behold , ye walk every one after the imagination of he evil heart , that they may not hearken unto i :
therefore will i cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not , neither ye nor you father ; and there shall ye serve other god day and night ; where i will not shew you favour .
therefore , behold , the day come , saith the lord , that it shall no more be say , the lord liveth , that bring up the child of israel out of the land of egypt ;
but , the lord liveth , that bring up the child of israel from the land of the north , and from all the land whither he have drive they : and i will bring they again into they land that i give unto they father .
behold , i will send for many fisher , saith the lord , and they shall fish they ; and after will i send for many hunter , and they shall hunt they from every mountain , and from every hill , and out of the hole of the rock .
for mine eye be upon all they way : they be not hide from my face , neither be they iniquity hide from mine eye .
and first i will recompense they iniquity and they sin double ; because they have defile my land , they have fill mine inheritance with the carcase of they detestable and abominable thing .
o lord , my strength , and my fortress , and my refuge in the day of affliction , the gentiles shall come unto thee from the end of the earth , and shall say , surely we father have inherit lie , vanity , and thing wherein there be no profit .
shall a man make god unto himself , and they be no god ?
therefore , behold , i will this once cause they to know , i will cause they to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name be the lord .
the sin of judah be write with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond : it be grave upon the table of they heart , and upon the horn of you altar ;
whilst they child remember they altar and they grove by the green tree upon the high hill .
o my mountain in the field , i will give thy substance and all thy treasure to the spoil , and thy high place for sin , throughout all thy border .
and thou , even thyself , shalt discontinue from thine heritage that i give thee ; and i will cause thee to serve thine enemy in the land which thou knowest not : for ye have kindle a fire in mine anger , which shall burn for ever .
thus saith the lord ; curse be the man that trusteth in man , and maketh flesh he arm , and whose heart departeth from the lord .
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good cometh ; but shall inhabit the parched place in the wilderness , in a salt land and not inhabit .
bless be the man that trusteth in the lord , and whose hope the lord be .
for he shall be as a tree plant by the water , and that spreadeth out she root by the river , and shall not see when heat cometh , but she leaf shall be green ; and shall not be careful in the year of drought , neither shall cease from yield fruit .
the heart be deceitful above all thing , and desperately wicked : who can know it ?
i the lord search the heart , i try the rein , even to give every man accord to he way , and accord to the fruit of he doings .
as the partridge sitteth on egg , and hatcheth they not ; so he that getteth riches , and not by right , shall leave they in the midst of he day , and at he end shall be a fool .
a glorious high throne from the beginning be the place of we sanctuary .
o lord , the hope of israel , all that forsake thee shall be ashamed , and they that depart from i shall be write in the earth , because they have forsake the lord , the fountain of live water .
heal i , o lord , and i shall be heal ; save i , and i shall be save : for thou art my praise .
behold , they say unto i , where be the word of the lord ? let it come now .
as for i , i have not hasten from be a pastor to follow thee : neither have i desire the woeful day ; thou knowest : that which come out of my lip be right before thee .
be not a terror unto i : thou art my hope in the day of evil .
let they be confound that persecute i , but let not i be confound : let they be dismayed , but let not i be dismay : bring upon they the day of evil , and destroy they with double destruction .
thus say the lord unto i ; go and stand in the gate of the child of the people , whereby the king of judah come in , and by the which they go out , and in all the gate of jerusalem ;
and say unto they , hear ye the word of the lord , ye king of judah , and all judah , and all the inhabitant of jerusalem , that enter in by these gate :
thus saith the lord ; take heed to yourselve , and bear no burden on the sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gate of jerusalem ;
neither carry forth a burden out of you house on the sabbath day , neither do ye any work , but hallow ye the sabbath day , as i command you father .
but they obey not , neither incline they ear , but make they neck stiff , that they might not hear , nor receive instruction .
and it shall come to pass , if ye diligently hearken unto i , saith the lord , to bring in no burden through the gate of this city on the sabbath day , but hallow the sabbath day , to do no work therein ;
then shall there enter into the gate of this city king and prince sit upon the throne of david , ride in chariot and on horse , they , and they prince , the man of judah , and the inhabitant of jerusalem : and this city shall remain for ever .
and they shall come from the city of judah , and from the place about jerusalem , and from the land of benjamin , and from the plain , and from the mountain , and from the south , bring burnt offering , and sacrifice , and meat offering , and incense , and bring sacrifice of praise , unto the house of the lord .
but if ye will not hearken unto i to hallow the sabbath day , and not to bear a burden , even enter in at the gate of jerusalem on the sabbath day ; then will i kindle a fire in the gate thereof , and it shall devour the palace of jerusalem , and it shall not be quench .
the word which come to jeremiah from the lord , say ,
arise , and go down to the potter 's house , and there i will cause thee to hear my word .
then i go down to the potter 's house , and , behold , he work a work on the wheel .
and the vessel that he make of clay be mar in the hand of the potter : so he make it again another vessel , as seem good to the potter to make it .
then the word of the lord come to i , say ,
o house of israel , can not i do with you as this potter ? saith the lord .
behold , as the clay be in the potter 's hand , so be ye in mine hand , o house of israel .
at what instant i shall speak concern a nation , and concern a kingdom , to pluck up , and to pull down , and to destroy it ;
if that nation , against whom i have pronounce , turn from they evil , i will repent of the evil that i think to do unto they .
and at what instant i shall speak concern a nation , and concern a kingdom , to build and to plant it ;
if it do evil in my sight , that it obey not my voice , then i will repent of the good , wherewith i say i would benefit they .
now therefore go to , speak to the man of judah , and to the inhabitant of jerusalem , say , thus saith the lord ; behold , i frame evil against you , and devise a device against you : return ye now every one from he evil way , and make you way and you doings good .
and they say , there be no hope : but we will walk after we own device , and we will every one do the imagination of he evil heart .
therefore thus saith the lord ; ask ye now among the heathen , who have hear such thing : the virgin of israel have do a very horrible thing .
will a man leave the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field ? or shall the cold flow water that come from another place be forsake ?
because my people have forget i , they have burn incense to vanity , and they have cause they to stumble in they way from the ancient path , to walk in path , in a way not cast up ;
to make they land desolate , and a perpetual hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonish , and wag he head .
i will scatter they as with a east wind before the enemy ; i will shew they the back , and not the face , in the day of they calamity .
then say they , come , and let we devise device against jeremiah ; for the law shall not perish from the priest , nor counsel from the wise , nor the word from the prophet .
come , and let we smite he with the tongue , and let we not give heed to any of he word .
give heed to i , o lord , and hearken to the voice of they that contend with i .
shall evil be recompense for good ? for they have dig a pit for my soul .
remember that i stand before thee to speak good for they , and to turn away thy wrath from they .
therefore deliver up they child to the famine , and pour out they blood by the force of the sword ; and let they wife be bereave of they child , and be widow ; and let they man be put to death ; let they young man be slay by the sword in battle .
let a cry be hear from they house , when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon they : for they have dig a pit to take i , and hide snare for my foot .
yet , lord , thou knowest all they counsel against i to slay i : forgive not they iniquity , neither blot out they sin from thy sight , but let they be overthrow before thee ; deal thus with they in the time of thine anger .
thus saith the lord , go and get a potter 's earthen bottle , and take of the ancient of the people , and of the ancient of the priest ;
and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom , which be by the entry of the east gate , and proclaim there the word that i shall tell thee ,
and say , hear ye the word of the lord , o king of judah , and inhabitant of jerusalem ; thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; behold , i will bring evil upon this place , the which whosoever heareth , he ear shall tingle .
because they have forsake i , and have estrange this place , and have burn incense in it unto other god , whom neither they nor they father have know , nor the king of judah , and have fill this place with the blood of innocent ;
they have build also the high place of baal , to burn they son with fire for burnt offering unto baal , which i command not , nor speak it , neither come it into my mind :
therefore , behold , the day come , saith the lord , that this place shall no more be call tophet , nor the valley of the son of hinnom , but the valley of slaughter .
and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this place ; and i will cause they to fall by the sword before they enemy , and by the hand of they that seek they life : and they carcase will i give to be meat for the fowl of the heaven , and for the beast of the earth .
and i will make this city desolate , and a hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plague thereof .
and i will cause they to eat the flesh of they son and the flesh of they daughter , and they shall eat every one the flesh of he friend in the siege and straitness , wherewith they enemy , and they that seek they life , shall straiten they .
then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the man that go with thee ,
and shalt say unto they , thus saith the lord of host ; even so will i break this people and this city , as one breaketh a potter 's vessel , that can not be make whole again : and they shall bury they in tophet , till there be no place to bury .
thus will i do unto this place , saith the lord , and to the inhabitant thereof , and even make this city as tophet :
and the house of jerusalem , and the house of the king of judah , shall be defile as the place of tophet , because of all the house upon whose roof they have burn incense unto all the host of heaven , and have pour out drink offering unto other god .
then come jeremiah from tophet , whither the lord have send he to prophesy ; and he stand in the court of the lord 's house ; and say to all the people ,
thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; behold , i will bring upon this city and upon all she town all the evil that i have pronounce against it , because they have harden they neck , that they might not hear my word .
now pashur the son of immer the priest , who be also chief governor in the house of the lord , hear that jeremiah prophesy these thing .
then pashur smite jeremiah the prophet , and put he in the stock that be in the high gate of benjamin , which be by the house of the lord .
and it come to pass on the morrow , that pashur bring forth jeremiah out of the stock .
then say jeremiah unto he , the lord have not call thy name pashur , but magormissabib .
for thus saith the lord , behold , i will make thee a terror to thyself , and to all thy friend : and they shall fall by the sword of they enemy , and thine eye shall behold it : and i will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon , and he shall carry they captive into babylon , and shall slay they with the sword .
moreover i will deliver all the strength of this city , and all the labour thereof , and all the precious thing thereof , and all the treasure of the king of judah will i give into the hand of they enemy , which shall spoil they , and take they , and carry they to babylon .
and thou , pashur , and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity : and thou shalt come to babylon , and there thou shalt die , and shalt be bury there , thou , and all thy friend , to whom thou hast prophesy lie .
o lord , thou hast deceive i , and i be deceive : thou art stronger than i , and hast prevail : i be in derision daily , every one mocketh i .
for since i speak , i cry out , i cry violence and spoil ; because the word of the lord be make a reproach unto i , and a derision , daily .
then i say , i will not make mention of he , nor speak any more in he name .
but he word be in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bone , and i be weary with forbearing , and i could not stay .
for i hear the defaming of many , fear on every side .
report , say they , and we will report it .
all my familiar watch for my halting , say , peradventure he will be entice , and we shall prevail against he , and we shall take we revenge on he .
but the lord be with i as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persecutor shall stumble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : they everlasting confusion shall never be forget .
but , o lord of host , that triest the righteous , and seest the rein and the heart , let i see thy vengeance on they : for unto thee have i open my cause .
sing unto the lord , praise ye the lord : for he have deliver the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoer .
curse be the day wherein i be bear : let not the day wherein my mother bare i be bless .
curse be the man who bring tiding to my father , say , a man child be bear unto thee ; make he very glad .
and let that man be as the city which the lord overthrow , and repent not : and let he hear the cry in the morning , and the shout at noontide ;
because he slew i not from the womb ; or that my mother might have be my grave , and she womb to be always great with i .
wherefore come i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow , that my day should be consume with shame ?
the word which come unto jeremiah from the lord , when king zedekiah send unto he pashur the son of melchiah , and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest , say ,
enquire , i pray thee , of the lord for we ; for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against we ; if so be that the lord will deal with we accord to all he wondrous work , that he may go up from we .
then say jeremiah unto they , thus shall ye say to zedekiah :
thus saith the lord god of israel ; behold , i will turn back the weapon of war that be in you hand , wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon , and against the chaldeans , which besiege you without the wall , and i will assemble they into the midst of this city .
and i myself will fight against you with a outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in fury , and in great wrath .
and i will smite the inhabitant of this city , both man and beast : they shall die of a great pestilence .
and afterward , saith the lord , i will deliver zedekiah king of judah , and he servant , and the people , and such as be leave in this city from the pestilence , from the sword , and from the famine , into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , and into the hand of they enemy , and into the hand of those that seek they life : and he shall smite they with the edge of the sword ; he shall not spare they , neither have pity , nor have mercy .
and unto this people thou shalt say , thus saith the lord ; behold , i set before you the way of life , and the way of death .
he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth out , and falleth to the chaldeans that besiege you , he shall live , and he life shall be unto he for a prey .
for i have set my face against this city for evil , and not for good , saith the lord : it shall be give into the hand of the king of babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
and touch the house of the king of judah , say , hear ye the word of the lord ;
o house of david , thus saith the lord ; execute judgment in the morning , and deliver he that be spoil out of the hand of the oppressor , lest my fury go out like fire , and burn that none can quench it , because of the evil of you doings .
behold , i be against thee , o inhabitant of the valley , and rock of the plain , saith the lord ; which say , who shall come down against we ? or who shall enter into we habitation ?
but i will punish you accord to the fruit of you doings , saith the lord : and i will kindle a fire in the forest thereof , and it shall devour all thing round about it .
thus saith the lord ; go down to the house of the king of judah , and speak there this word ,
and say , hear the word of the lord , o king of judah , that sittest upon the throne of david , thou , and thy servant , and thy people that enter in by these gate :
thus saith the lord ; execute ye judgment and righteousness , and deliver the spoil out of the hand of the oppressor : and do no wrong , do no violence to the stranger , the fatherless , nor the widow , neither shed innocent blood in this place .
for if ye do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gate of this house king sit upon the throne of david , ride in chariot and on horse , he , and he servant , and he people .
but if ye will not hear these word , i swear by myself , saith the lord , that this house shall become a desolation .
for thus saith the lord unto the king 's house of judah ; thou art gilead unto i , and the head of lebanon : yet surely i will make thee a wilderness , and city which be not inhabit .
and i will prepare destroyer against thee , every one with he weapon : and they shall cut down thy choice cedar , and cast they into the fire .
and many nation shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to he neighbour , wherefore have the lord do thus unto this great city ?
then they shall answer , because they have forsake the covenant of the lord they god , and worship other god , and serve they .
weep ye not for the dead , neither bemoan he : but weep sore for he that goeth away : for he shall return no more , nor see he native country .
for thus saith the lord touch shallum the son of josiah king of judah , which reign instead of josiah he father , which go forth out of this place ; he shall not return thither any more :
but he shall die in the place whither they have lead he captive , and shall see this land no more .
woe unto he that buildeth he house by unrighteousness , and he chamber by wrong ; that useth he neighbour 's service without wages , and giveth he not for he work ;
that saith , i will build i a wide house and large chamber , and cutteth he out window ; and it be ciel with cedar , and paint with vermilion .
shalt thou reign , because thou closest thyself in cedar ? do not thy father eat and drink , and do judgment and justice , and then it be well with he ?
he judge the cause of the poor and needy ; then it be well with he : be not this to know i ? saith the lord .
but thine eye and thine heart be not but for thy covetousness , and for to shed innocent blood , and for oppression , and for violence , to do it .
therefore thus saith the lord concern jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah ; they shall not lament for he , say , ah my brother ! or , ah sister ! they shall not lament for he , say , ah lord ! or , ah he glory !
he shall be bury with the burial of a ass , draw and cast forth beyond the gate of jerusalem .
go up to lebanon , and cry ; and lift up thy voice in bashan , and cry from the passage : for all thy lover be destroy .
i speak unto thee in thy prosperity ; but thou saidst , i will not hear .
this have be thy manner from thy youth , that thou obeyedst not my voice .
the wind shall eat up all thy pastor , and thy lover shall go into captivity : surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confound for all thy wickedness .
o inhabitant of lebanon , that makest thy nest in the cedar , how gracious shalt thou be when pang come upon thee , the pain as of a woman in travail !
as i live , saith the lord , though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah be the signet upon my right hand , yet would i pluck thee thence ;
and i will give thee into the hand of they that seek thy life , and into the hand of they whose face thou fearest , even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , and into the hand of the chaldeans .
and i will cast thee out , and thy mother that bare thee , into another country , where ye be not bear ; and there shall ye die .
but to the land whereunto they desire to return , thither shall they not return .
be this man coniah a despise broken idol ? be he a vessel wherein be no pleasure ? wherefore be they cast out , he and he seed , and be cast into a land which they know not ?
o earth , earth , earth , hear the word of the lord .
thus saith the lord , write ye this man childless , a man that shall not prosper in he day : for no man of he seed shall prosper , sit upon the throne of david , and rule any more in judah .
woe be unto the pastor that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture ! saith the lord .
therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastor that feed my people ; ye have scatter my flock , and drive they away , and have not visit they : behold , i will visit upon you the evil of you doings , saith the lord .
and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all country whither i have drive they , and will bring they again to they fold ; and they shall be fruitful and increase .
and i will set up shepherd over they which shall feed they : and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall they be lack , saith the lord .
behold , the day come , saith the lord , that i will raise unto david a righteous branch , and a king shall reign and prosper , and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth .
in he day judah shall be save , and israel shall dwell safely : and this be he name whereby he shall be call , the lord our righteousness .
therefore , behold , the day come , saith the lord , that they shall no more say , the lord liveth , which bring up the child of israel out of the land of egypt ;
but , the lord liveth , which bring up and which lead the seed of the house of israel out of the north country , and from all country whither i have drive they ; and they shall dwell in they own land .
mine heart within i be break because of the prophet ; all my bone shake ; i be like a drunken man , and like a man whom wine have overcome , because of the lord , and because of the word of he holiness .
for the land be full of adulterer ; for because of swearing the land mourneth ; the pleasant place of the wilderness be dry up , and they course be evil , and they force be not right .
for both prophet and priest be profane ; yea , in my house have i find they wickedness , saith the lord .
wherefore they way shall be unto they as slippery way in the darkness : they shall be drive on , and fall therein : for i will bring evil upon they , even the year of they visitation , saith the lord .
and i have see folly in the prophet of samaria ; they prophesy in baal , and cause my people israel to err .
i have see also in the prophet of jerusalem a horrible thing : they commit adultery , and walk in lie : they strengthen also the hand of evildoer , that none doth return from he wickedness : they be all of they unto i as sodom , and the inhabitant thereof as gomorrah .
therefore thus saith the lord of host concern the prophet ; behold , i will feed they with wormwood , and make they drink the water of gall : for from the prophet of jerusalem be profaneness go forth into all the land .
thus saith the lord of host , hearken not unto the word of the prophet that prophesy unto you : they make you vain : they speak a vision of they own heart , and not out of the mouth of the lord .
they say still unto they that despise i , the lord have say , ye shall have peace ; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of he own heart , no evil shall come upon you .
for who have stand in the counsel of the lord , and have perceive and hear he word ? who have marked he word , and hear it ?
behold , a whirlwind of the lord be go forth in fury , even a grievous whirlwind : it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked .
the anger of the lord shall not return , until he have execute , and till he have perform the thought of he heart : in the latter day ye shall consider it perfectly .
i have not send these prophet , yet they run : i have not speak to they , yet they prophesy .
but if they have stand in my counsel , and have cause my people to hear my word , then they should have turn they from they evil way , and from the evil of they doings .
be i a god at hand , saith the lord , and not a god afar off ?
can any hide himself in secret place that i shall not see he ? saith the lord .
do not i fill heaven and earth ? saith the lord .
i have hear what the prophet say , that prophesy lie in my name , say , i have dream , i have dream .
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophet that prophesy lie ? yea , they be prophet of the deceit of they own heart ;
which think to cause my people to forget my name by they dream which they tell every man to he neighbour , as they father have forget my name for baal .
the prophet that have a dream , let he tell a dream ; and he that have my word , let he speak my word faithfully .
what be the chaff to the wheat ? saith the lord .
be not my word like as a fire ? saith the lord ; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in piece ?
therefore , behold , i be against the prophet , saith the lord , that steal my word every one from he neighbour .
behold , i be against the prophet , saith the lord , that use they tongue , and say , he saith .
behold , i be against they that prophesy false dream , saith the lord , and do tell they , and cause my people to err by they lie , and by they lightness ; yet i send they not , nor command they : therefore they shall not profit this people at all , saith the lord .
and when this people , or the prophet , or a priest , shall ask thee , say , what be the burden of the lord ? thou shalt then say unto they , what burden ?
i will even forsake you , saith the lord .
and as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , that shall say , the burden of the lord , i will even punish that man and he house .
thus shall ye say every one to he neighbour , and every one to he brother , what have the lord answer ? and , what have the lord speak ?
and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more : for every man 's word shall be he burden ; for ye have pervert the word of the living god , of the lord of host we god .
thus shalt thou say to the prophet , what have the lord answer thee ? and , what have the lord speak ?
but since ye say , the burden of the lord ; therefore thus saith the lord ; because ye say this word , the burden of the lord , and i have send unto you , say , ye shall not say , the burden of the lord ;
therefore , behold , i , even i , will utterly forget you , and i will forsake you , and the city that i give you and you father , and cast you out of my presence :
and i will bring a everlasting reproach upon you , and a perpetual shame , which shall not be forget .
the lord shew i , and , behold , two basket of fig be set before the temple of the lord , after that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon have carry away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah , and the prince of judah , with the carpenter and smith , from jerusalem , and have bring they to babylon .
one basket have very good fig , even like the fig that be first ripe : and the other basket have very naughty fig , which could not be eat , they be so bad .
then say the lord unto i , what seest thou , jeremiah ?
and i say , fig ; the good fig , very good ; and the evil , very evil , that can not be eat , they be so evil .
again the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
thus saith the lord , the god of israel ; like these good fig , so will i acknowledge they that be carry away captive of judah , whom i have send out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for they good .
for i will set mine eye upon they for good , and i will bring they again to this land : and i will build they , and not pull they down ; and i will plant they , and not pluck they up .
and i will give they a heart to know i , that i be the lord : and they shall be my people , and i will be they god : for they shall return unto i with they whole heart .
and as the evil fig , which can not be eat , they be so evil ; surely thus saith the lord , so will i give zedekiah the king of judah , and he prince , and the residue of jerusalem , that remain in this land , and they that dwell in the land of egypt :
and i will deliver they to be remove into all the kingdom of the earth for they hurt , to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse , in all place whither i shall drive they .
and i will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , among they , till they be consume from off the land that i give unto they and to they father .
the word that come to jeremiah concern all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , that be the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon ;
the which jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah , and to all the inhabitant of jerusalem , say ,
from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah , even unto this day , that be the three and twentieth year , the word of the lord have come unto i , and i have speak unto you , rise early and speaking ; but ye have not hearken .
and the lord have send unto you all he servant the prophet , rise early and send they ; but ye have not hearken , nor inclined you ear to hear .
they say , turn ye again now every one from he evil way , and from the evil of you doings , and dwell in the land that the lord have give unto you and to you father for ever and ever :
and go not after other god to serve they , and to worship they , and provoke i not to anger with the work of you hand ; and i will do you no hurt .
yet ye have not hearken unto i , saith the lord ; that ye might provoke i to anger with the work of you hand to you own hurt .
therefore thus saith the lord of host ; because ye have not hear my word ,
behold , i will send and take all the family of the north , saith the lord , and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon , my servant , and will bring they against this land , and against the inhabitant thereof , and against all these nation round about , and will utterly destroy they , and make they a astonishment , and a hissing , and perpetual desolation .
moreover i will take from they the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstone , and the light of the candle .
and this whole land shall be a desolation , and a astonishment ; and these nation shall serve the king of babylon seventy year .
and it shall come to pass , when seventy year be accomplish , that i will punish the king of babylon , and that nation , saith the lord , for they iniquity , and the land of the chaldeans , and will make it perpetual desolation .
and i will bring upon that land all my word which i have pronounce against it , even all that be write in this book , which jeremiah have prophesy against all the nation .
for many nation and great king shall serve themselves of they also : and i will recompense they accord to they deed , and accord to the work of they own hand .
for thus saith the lord god of israel unto i ; take the wine cup of this fury at my hand , and cause all the nation , to whom i send thee , to drink it .
and they shall drink , and be move , and be mad , because of the sword that i will send among they .
then take i the cup at the lord 's hand , and make all the nation to drink , unto whom the lord have send i :
to wit , jerusalem , and the city of judah , and the king thereof , and the prince thereof , to make they a desolation , a astonishment , a hissing , and a curse ; as it be this day ;
pharaoh king of egypt , and he servant , and he prince , and all he people ;
and all the mingled people , and all the king of the land of uz , and all the king of the land of the philistines , and ashkelon , and azzah , and ekron , and the remnant of ashdod ,
edom , and moab , and the child of ammon ,
and all the king of tyrus , and all the king of zidon , and the king of the isle which be beyond the sea ,
dedan , and tema , and buz , and all that be in the utmost corner ,
and all the king of arabia , and all the king of the mingled people that dwell in the desert ,
and all the king of zimri , and all the king of elam , and all the king of the medes ,
and all the king of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the kingdom of the world , which be upon the face of the earth : and the king of sheshach shall drink after they .
therefore thou shalt say unto they , thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; drink ye , and be drunken , and spue , and fall , and rise no more , because of the sword which i will send among you .
and it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink , then shalt thou say unto they , thus saith the lord of host ; ye shall certainly drink .
for , lo , i begin to bring evil on the city which be call by my name , and should ye be utterly unpunished ?
ye shall not be unpunished : for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitant of the earth , saith the lord of host .
therefore prophesy thou against they all these word , and say unto they , the lord shall roar from on high , and utter he voice from he holy habitation ; he shall mightily roar upon he habitation ; he shall give a shout , as they that tread the grape , against all the inhabitant of the earth .
a noise shall come even to the end of the earth ; for the lord have a controversy with the nation , he will plead with all flesh ; he will give they that be wicked to the sword , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord of host , behold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great whirlwind shall be raise up from the coast of the earth .
and the slay of the lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth : they shall not be lament , neither gather , nor bury ; they shall be dung upon the ground .
howl , ye shepherd , and cry ; and wallow yourselve in the ash , ye principal of the flock : for the day of you slaughter and of you dispersion be accomplish ; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel .
and the shepherd shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the shepherd , and a howling of the principal of the flock , shall be hear : for the lord have spoil they pasture .
and the peaceable habitation be cut down because of the fierce anger of the lord .
he have forsake he covert , as the lion : for they land be desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor , and because of he fierce anger .
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah come this word from the lord , say ,
thus saith the lord ; stand in the court of the lord 's house , and speak unto all the city of judah , which come to worship in the lord 's house , all the word that i command thee to speak unto they ; diminish not a word :
if so be they will hearken , and turn every man from he evil way , that i may repent i of the evil , which i purpose to do unto they because of the evil of they doings .
and thou shalt say unto they , thus saith the lord ; if ye will not hearken to i , to walk in my law , which i have set before you ,
to hearken to the word of my servant the prophet , whom i send unto you , both rise up early , and send they , but ye have not hearken ;
then will i make this house like shiloh , and will make this city a curse to all the nation of the earth .
so the priest and the prophet and all the people hear jeremiah speak these word in the house of the lord .
now it come to pass , when jeremiah have make a end of speak all that the lord have command he to speak unto all the people , that the priest and the prophet and all the people take he , say , thou shalt surely die .
why hast thou prophesy in the name of the lord , say , this house shall be like shiloh , and this city shall be desolate without a inhabitant ?
and all the people be gather against jeremiah in the house of the lord .
when the prince of judah hear these thing , then they come up from the king 's house unto the house of the lord , and sit down in the entry of the new gate of the lord 's house .
then speak the priest and the prophet unto the prince and to all the people , say , this man be worthy to die ; for he have prophesy against this city , as ye have hear with you ear .
then spake jeremiah unto all the prince and to all the people , say , the lord send i to prophesy against this house and against this city all the word that ye have hear .
therefore now amend you way and you doings , and obey the voice of the lord you god ; and the lord will repent he of the evil that he have pronounced against you .
as for i , behold , i be in you hand : do with i as seemeth good and meet unto you .
but know ye for certain , that if ye put i to death , ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselve , and upon this city , and upon the inhabitant thereof : for of a truth the lord have send i unto you to speak all these word in you ear .
then say the prince and all the people unto the priest and to the prophet ; this man be not worthy to die : for he have speak to we in the name of the lord we god .
then rise up certain of the elder of the land , and spake to all the assembly of the people , say ,
micah the morasthite prophesy in the day of hezekiah king of judah , and spake to all the people of judah , say , thus saith the lord of host ; zion shall be plow like a field , and jerusalem shall become heap , and the mountain of the house as the high place of a forest .
do hezekiah king of judah and all judah put he at all to death ? do he not fear the lord , and beseech the lord , and the lord repent he of the evil which he have pronounce against they ?
thus might we procure great evil against we soul .
and there be also a man that prophesy in the name of the lord , urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim , who prophesy against this city and against this land accord to all the word of jeremiah :
and when jehoiakim the king , with all he mighty man , and all the prince , hear he word , the king seek to put he to death : but when urijah hear it , he be afraid , and flee , and go into egypt ;
and jehoiakim the king send man into egypt , namely , elnathan the son of achbor , and certain man with he into egypt .
and they fetch forth urijah out of egypt , and bring he unto jehoiakim the king ; who slew he with the sword , and cast he dead body into the grave of the common people .
nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan be with jeremiah , that they should not give he into the hand of the people to put he to death .
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah come this word unto jeremiah from the lord , say ,
thus saith the lord to i ; make thee bond and yoke , and put they upon thy neck ,
and send they to the king of edom , and to the king of moab , and to the king of the ammonites , and to the king of tyrus , and to the king of zidon , by the hand of the messenger which come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah ;
and command they to say unto they master , thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; thus shall ye say unto you master ;
i have make the earth , the man and the beast that be upon the ground , by my great power and by my outstretched arm , and have give it unto whom it seem meet unto i .
and now have i give all these land into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon , my servant ; and the beast of the field have i give he also to serve he .
and all nation shall serve he , and he son , and he son 's son , until the very time of he land come : and then many nation and great king shall serve themselves of he .
and it shall come to pass , that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon , and that will not put they neck under the yoke of the king of babylon , that nation will i punish , saith the lord , with the sword , and with the famine , and with the pestilence , until i have consume they by he hand .
therefore hearken not ye to you prophet , nor to you diviner , nor to you dreamer , nor to you enchanter , nor to you sorcerer , which speak unto you , say , ye shall not serve the king of babylon :
for they prophesy a lie unto you , to remove you far from you land ; and that i should drive you out , and ye should perish .
but the nation that bring they neck under the yoke of the king of babylon , and serve he , those will i let remain still in they own land , saith the lord ; and they shall till it , and dwell therein .
i speak also to zedekiah king of judah accord to all these word , say , bring you neck under the yoke of the king of babylon , and serve he and he people , and live .
why will ye die , thou and thy people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , as the lord have speak against the nation that will not serve the king of babylon ?
therefore hearken not unto the word of the prophet that speak unto you , say , ye shall not serve the king of babylon : for they prophesy a lie unto you .
for i have not send they , saith the lord , yet they prophesy a lie in my name ; that i might drive you out , and that ye might perish , ye , and the prophet that prophesy unto you .
also i speak to the priest and to all this people , say , thus saith the lord ; hearken not to the word of you prophet that prophesy unto you , say , behold , the vessel of the lord 's house shall now shortly be bring again from babylon : for they prophesy a lie unto you .
hearken not unto they ; serve the king of babylon , and live : wherefore should this city be lay waste ?
but if they be prophet , and if the word of the lord be with they , let they now make intercession to the lord of host , that the vessel which be leave in the house of the lord , and in the house of the king of judah , and at jerusalem , go not to babylon .
for thus saith the lord of host concern the pillar , and concern the sea , and concern the basis , and concern the residue of the vessel that remain in this city ,
which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon take not , when he carry away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from jerusalem to babylon , and all the noble of judah and jerusalem ;
yea , thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel , concern the vessel that remain in the house of the lord , and in the house of the king of judah and of jerusalem ;
they shall be carry to babylon , and there shall they be until the day that i visit they , saith the lord ; then will i bring they up , and restore they to this place .
and it come to pass the same year , in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah , in the fourth year , and in the fifth month , that hananiah the son of azur the prophet , which be of gibeon , speak unto i in the house of the lord , in the presence of the priest and of all the people , say ,
thus speaketh the lord of host , the god of israel , say , i have break the yoke of the king of babylon .
within two full year will i bring again into this place all the vessel of the lord 's house , that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon take away from this place , and carry they to babylon :
and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah , with all the captive of judah , that go into babylon , saith the lord : for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon .
then the prophet jeremiah say unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priest , and in the presence of all the people that stand in the house of the lord ,
even the prophet jeremiah say , amen : the lord do so : the lord perform thy word which thou hast prophesy , to bring again the vessel of the lord 's house , and all that be carry away captive , from babylon into this place .
nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ear , and in the ear of all the people ;
the prophet that have be before i and before thee of old prophesy both against many country , and against great kingdom , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence .
the prophet which prophesieth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to pass , then shall the prophet be know , that the lord have truly send he .
then hananiah the prophet take the yoke from off the prophet jeremiah 's neck , and brake it .
and hananiah spake in the presence of all the people , say , thus saith the lord ; even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all nation within the space of two full year .
and the prophet jeremiah go he way .
then the word of the lord come unto jeremiah the prophet , after that hananiah the prophet have break the yoke from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah , say ,
go and tell hananiah , say , thus saith the lord ; thou hast break the yoke of wood ; but thou shalt make for they yoke of iron .
for thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nation , that they may serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon ; and they shall serve he : and i have give he the beast of the field also .
then say the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet , hear now , hananiah ; the lord have not send thee ; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie .
therefore thus saith the lord ; behold , i will cast thee from off the face of the earth : this year thou shalt die , because thou hast teach rebellion against the lord .
so hananiah the prophet die the same year in the seventh month .
now these be the word of the letter that jeremiah the prophet send from jerusalem unto the residue of the elder which be carry away captive , and to the priest , and to the prophet , and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar have carry away captive from jerusalem to babylon ;
( after that jeconiah the king , and the queen , and the eunuch , the prince of judah and jerusalem , and the carpenter , and the smith , be depart from jerusalem ; )
by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan , and gemariah the son of hilkiah , ( whom zedekiah king of judah send unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon ) say ,
thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel , unto all that be carry away captive , whom i have cause to be carry away from jerusalem unto babylon ;
build ye house , and dwell in they ; and plant garden , and eat the fruit of they ;
take ye wife , and beget son and daughter ; and take wife for you son , and give you daughter to husband , that they may bear son and daughter ; that ye may be increase there , and not diminish .
and seek the peace of the city whither i have cause you to be carry away captive , and pray unto the lord for it : for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace .
for thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; let not you prophet and you diviner , that be in the midst of you , deceive you , neither hearken to you dream which ye cause to be dream .
for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name : i have not send they , saith the lord .
for thus saith the lord , that after seventy year be accomplish at babylon i will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in cause you to return to this place .
for i know the thought that i think toward you , saith the lord , thought of peace , and not of evil , to give you a expect end .
then shall ye call upon i , and ye shall go and pray unto i , and i will hearken unto you .
and ye shall seek i , and find i , when ye shall search for i with all you heart .
and i will be find of you , saith the lord : and i will turn away you captivity , and i will gather you from all the nation , and from all the place whither i have drive you , saith the lord ; and i will bring you again into the place whence i cause you to be carry away captive .
because ye have say , the lord have raise we up prophet in babylon ;
know that thus saith the lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of david , and of all the people that dwelleth in this city , and of you brethren that be not go forth with you into captivity ;
thus saith the lord of host ; behold , i will send upon they the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make they like vile fig , that can not be eat , they be so evil .
and i will persecute they with the sword , with the famine , and with the pestilence , and will deliver they to be remove to all the kingdom of the earth , to be a curse , and a astonishment , and a hissing , and a reproach , among all the nation whither i have drive they :
because they have not hearken to my word , saith the lord , which i send unto they by my servant the prophet , rise up early and send they ; but ye would not hear , saith the lord .
hear ye therefore the word of the lord , all ye of the captivity , whom i have send from jerusalem to babylon :
thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel , of ahab the son of kolaiah , and of zedekiah the son of maaseiah , which prophesy a lie unto you in my name ; behold , i will deliver they into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon ; and he shall slay they before you eye ;
and of they shall be take up a curse by all the captivity of judah which be in babylon , say , the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab , whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire ;
because they have commit villany in israel , and have commit adultery with they neighbour ' wife , and have speak lie word in my name , which i have not command they ; even i know , and be a witness , saith the lord .
thus shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamite , say ,
thus speaketh the lord of host , the god of israel , say , because thou hast send letter in thy name unto all the people that be at jerusalem , and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest , and to all the priest , say ,
the lord have make thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the priest , that ye should be officer in the house of the lord , for every man that be mad , and maketh himself a prophet , that thou shouldest put he in prison , and in the stock .
now therefore why hast thou not reprove jeremiah of anathoth , which maketh himself a prophet to you ?
for therefore he send unto we in babylon , say , this captivity be long : build ye house , and dwell in they ; and plant garden , and eat the fruit of they .
and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ear of jeremiah the prophet .
then come the word of the lord unto jeremiah , say ,
send to all they of the captivity , say , thus saith the lord concern shemaiah the nehelamite ; because that shemaiah have prophesy unto you , and i send he not , and he cause you to trust in a lie :
therefore thus saith the lord ; behold , i will punish shemaiah the nehelamite , and he seed : he shall not have a man to dwell among this people ; neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my people , saith the lord ; because he have teach rebellion against the lord .
the word that come to jeremiah from the lord , say ,
thus speaketh the lord god of israel , say , write thee all the word that i have speak unto thee in a book .
for , lo , the day come , saith the lord , that i will bring again the captivity of my people israel and judah , saith the lord : and i will cause they to return to the land that i give to they father , and they shall possess it .
and these be the word that the lord spake concern israel and concern judah .
for thus saith the lord ; we have hear a voice of tremble , of fear , and not of peace .
ask ye now , and see whether a man doth travail with child ? wherefore do i see every man with he hand on he loin , as a woman in travail , and all face be turn into paleness ?
alas ! for that day be great , so that none be like it : it be even the time of jacob 's trouble , but he shall be save out of it .
for it shall come to pass in that day , saith the lord of host , that i will break he yoke from off thy neck , and will burst thy bond , and stranger shall no more serve themselves of he :
but they shall serve the lord they god , and david they king , whom i will raise up unto they .
therefore fear thou not , o my servant jacob , saith the lord ; neither be dismayed , o israel : for , lo , i will save thee from afar , and thy seed from the land of they captivity ; and jacob shall return , and shall be in rest , and be quiet , and none shall make he afraid .
for i be with thee , saith the lord , to save thee : though i make a full end of all nation whither i have scatter thee , yet will i not make a full end of thee : but i will correct thee in measure , and will not leave thee altogether unpunished .
for thus saith the lord , thy bruise be incurable , and thy wound be grievous .
there be none to plead thy cause , that thou mayest be bind up : thou hast no healing medicine .
all thy lover have forget thee ; they seek thee not ; for i have wound thee with the wound of a enemy , with the chastisement of a cruel one , for the multitude of thine iniquity ; because thy sin be increase .
why criest thou for thine affliction ? thy sorrow be incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity : because thy sin be increase , i have do these thing unto thee .
therefore all they that devour thee shall be devour ; and all thine adversary , every one of they , shall go into captivity ; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil , and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey .
for i will restore health unto thee , and i will heal thee of thy wound , saith the lord ; because they call thee a outcast , say , this be zion , whom no man seeketh after .
thus saith the lord ; behold , i will bring again the captivity of jacob 's tent , and have mercy on he dwellingplace ; and the city shall be build upon she own heap , and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof .
and out of they shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of they that make merry : and i will multiply they , and they shall not be few ; i will also glorify they , and they shall not be small .
they child also shall be as aforetime , and they congregation shall be establish before i , and i will punish all that oppress they .
and they noble shall be of themselves , and they governor shall proceed from the midst of they ; and i will cause he to draw near , and he shall approach unto i : for who be this that engage he heart to approach unto i ? saith the lord .
and ye shall be my people , and i will be you god .
behold , the whirlwind of the lord goeth forth with fury , a continue whirlwind : it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked .
the fierce anger of the lord shall not return , until he have do it , and until he have perform the intent of he heart : in the latter day ye shall consider it .
at the same time , saith the lord , will i be the god of all the family of israel , and they shall be my people .
thus saith the lord , the people which be leave of the sword find grace in the wilderness ; even israel , when i go to cause he to rest .
the lord have appear of old unto i , say , yea , i have love thee with a everlasting love : therefore with lovingkindness have i draw thee .
again i will build thee , and thou shalt be build , o virgin of israel : thou shalt again be adorn with thy tabret , and shalt go forth in the dance of they that make merry .
thou shalt yet plant vine upon the mountain of samaria : the planter shall plant , and shall eat they as common thing .
for there shall be a day , that the watchman upon the mount ephraim shall cry , arise ye , and let we go up to zion unto the lord we god .
for thus saith the lord ; sing with gladness for jacob , and shout among the chief of the nation : publish ye , praise ye , and say , o lord , save thy people , the remnant of israel .
behold , i will bring they from the north country , and gather they from the coast of the earth , and with they the blind and the lame , the woman with child and she that travaileth with child together : a great company shall return thither .
they shall come with weep , and with supplication will i lead they : i will cause they to walk by the river of water in a straight way , wherein they shall not stumble : for i be a father to israel , and ephraim be my firstborn .
hear the word of the lord , o ye nation , and declare it in the isle afar off , and say , he that scatter israel will gather he , and keep he , as a shepherd doth he flock .
for the lord have redeem jacob , and ransom he from the hand of he that be stronger than he .
therefore they shall come and sing in the height of zion , and shall flow together to the goodness of the lord , for wheat , and for wine , and for oil , and for the young of the flock and of the herd : and they soul shall be as a water garden ; and they shall not sorrow any more at all .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , both young man and old together : for i will turn they mourning into joy , and will comfort they , and make they rejoice from they sorrow .
and i will satiate the soul of the priest with fatness , and my people shall be satisfy with my goodness , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord ; a voice be hear in ramah , lamentation , and bitter weep ; rahel weep for she child refuse to be comfort for she child , because they be not .
thus saith the lord ; refrain thy voice from weep , and thine eye from tear : for thy work shall be reward , saith the lord ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
and there be hope in thine end , saith the lord , that thy child shall come again to they own border .
i have surely hear ephraim bemoan himself thus ; thou hast chastise i , and i be chastise , as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke : turn thou i , and i shall be turn ; for thou art the lord my god .
surely after that i be turn , i repent ; and after that i be instruct , i smite upon my thigh : i be ashamed , yea , even confound , because i do bear the reproach of my youth .
be ephraim my dear son ? be he a pleasant child ? for since i speak against he , i do earnestly remember he still : therefore my bowels be trouble for he ; i will surely have mercy upon he , saith the lord .
set thee up waymark , make thee high heap : set thine heart toward the highway , even the way which thou wentest : turn again , o virgin of israel , turn again to these thy city .
how long wilt thou go about , o thou backslide daughter ? for the lord have create a new thing in the earth , a woman shall compass a man .
thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; as yet they shall use this speech in the land of judah and in the city thereof , when i shall bring again they captivity ; the lord bless thee , o habitation of justice , and mountain of holiness .
and there shall dwell in judah itself , and in all the city thereof together , husbandman , and they that go forth with flock .
for i have satiate the weary soul , and i have replenish every sorrowful soul .
upon this i awake , and beheld ; and my sleep be sweet unto i .
behold , the day come , saith the lord , that i will sow the house of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of beast .
and it shall come to pass , that like as i have watch over they , to pluck up , and to break down , and to throw down , and to destroy , and to afflict ; so will i watch over they , to build , and to plant , saith the lord .
in those day they shall say no more , the father have eat a sour grape , and the child 's tooth be set on edge .
but every one shall die for he own iniquity : every man that eateth the sour grape , he tooth shall be set on edge .
behold , the day come , saith the lord , that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel , and with the house of judah :
not accord to the covenant that i make with they father in the day that i take they by the hand to bring they out of the land of egypt ; which my covenant they brake , although i be a husband unto they , saith the lord :
but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel ; after those day , saith the lord , i will put my law in they inward part , and write it in they heart ; and will be they god , and they shall be my people .
and they shall teach no more every man he neighbour , and every man he brother , say , know the lord : for they shall all know i , from the least of they unto the greatest of they , saith the lord : for i will forgive they iniquity , and i will remember they sin no more .
thus saith the lord , which giveth the sun for a light by day , and the ordinance of the moon and of the star for a light by night , which divideth the sea when the wave thereof roar ; the lord of host be he name :
if those ordinance depart from before i , saith the lord , then the seed of israel also shall cease from be a nation before i for ever .
thus saith the lord ; if heaven above can be measure , and the foundation of the earth search out beneath , i will also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have do , saith the lord .
behold , the day come , saith the lord , that the city shall be build to the lord from the tower of hananeel unto the gate of the corner .
and the measure line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill gareb , and shall compass about to goath .
and the whole valley of the dead body , and of the ash , and all the field unto the brook of kidron , unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east , shall be holy unto the lord ; it shall not be pluck up , nor throw down any more for ever .
the word that come to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah , which be the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar .
for then the king of babylon 's army besiege jerusalem : and jeremiah the prophet be shut up in the court of the prison , which be in the king of judah 's house .
for zedekiah king of judah have shut he up , say , wherefore dost thou prophesy , and say , thus saith the lord , behold , i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon , and he shall take it ;
and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand of the chaldeans , but shall surely be deliver into the hand of the king of babylon , and shall speak with he mouth to mouth , and he eye shall behold he eye ;
and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon , and there shall he be until i visit he , saith the lord : though ye fight with the chaldeans , ye shall not prosper .
and jeremiah say , the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
behold , hanameel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee , say , buy thee my field that be in anathoth : for the right of redemption be thine to buy it .
so hanameel mine uncle 's son come to i in the court of the prison accord to the word of the lord , and say unto i , buy my field , i pray thee , that be in anathoth , which be in the country of benjamin : for the right of inheritance be thine , and the redemption be thine ; buy it for thyself .
then i know that this be the word of the lord .
and i buy the field of hanameel my uncle 's son , that be in anathoth , and weigh he the money , even seventeen shekel of silver .
and i subscribe the evidence , and seal it , and take witness , and weigh he the money in the balance .
so i take the evidence of the purchase , both that which be seal accord to the law and custom , and that which be open :
and i give the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah , the son of maaseiah , in the sight of hanameel mine uncle 's son , and in the presence of the witness that subscribe the book of the purchase , before all the jews that sit in the court of the prison .
and i charge baruch before they , say ,
thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; take these evidence , this evidence of the purchase , both which be seal , and this evidence which be open ; and put they in a earthen vessel , that they may continue many day .
for thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; house and field and vineyard shall be possess again in this land .
now when i have deliver the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah , i pray unto the lord , say ,
ah lord god ! behold , thou hast make the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretch out arm , and there be nothing too hard for thee :
thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousand , and recompensest the iniquity of the father into the bosom of they child after they : the great , the mighty god , the lord of host , be he name ,
great in counsel , and mighty in work : for thine eye be open upon all the way of the son of man : to give every one accord to he way , and accord to the fruit of he doings :
which hast set sign and wonder in the land of egypt , even unto this day , and in israel , and among other man ; and hast make thee a name , as at this day ;
and hast bring forth thy people israel out of the land of egypt with sign , and with wonder , and with a strong hand , and with a stretch out arm , and with great terror ;
and hast give they this land , which thou didst swear to they father to give they , a land flow with milk and honey ;
and they come in , and possess it ; but they obey not thy voice , neither walk in thy law ; they have do nothing of all that thou commandedst they to do : therefore thou hast cause all this evil to come upon they :
behold the mount , they be come unto the city to take it ; and the city be give into the hand of the chaldeans , that fight against it , because of the sword , and of the famine , and of the pestilence : and what thou hast speak be come to pass ; and , behold , thou seest it .
and thou hast say unto i , o lord god , buy thee the field for money , and take witness ; for the city be give into the hand of the chaldeans .
then come the word of the lord unto jeremiah , say ,
behold , i be the lord , the god of all flesh : be there any thing too hard for i ?
therefore thus saith the lord ; behold , i will give this city into the hand of the chaldeans , and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , and he shall take it :
and the chaldeans , that fight against this city , shall come and set fire on this city , and burn it with the house , upon whose roof they have offer incense unto baal , and pour out drink offering unto other god , to provoke i to anger .
for the child of israel and the child of judah have only do evil before i from they youth : for the child of israel have only provoke i to anger with the work of they hand , saith the lord .
for this city have be to i as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they build it even unto this day ; that i should remove it from before my face ,
because of all the evil of the child of israel and of the child of judah , which they have do to provoke i to anger , they , they king , they prince , they priest , and they prophet , and the man of judah , and the inhabitant of jerusalem .
and they have turn unto i the back , and not the face : though i teach they , rise up early and teach they , yet they have not hearken to receive instruction .
but they set they abomination in the house , which be call by my name , to defile it .
and they build the high place of baal , which be in the valley of the son of hinnom , to cause they son and they daughter to pass through the fire unto molech ; which i command they not , neither come it into my mind , that they should do this abomination , to cause judah to sin .
and now therefore thus saith the lord , the god of israel , concern this city , whereof ye say , it shall be deliver into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
behold , i will gather they out of all country , whither i have drive they in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and i will bring they again unto this place , and i will cause they to dwell safely :
and they shall be my people , and i will be they god :
and i will give they one heart , and one way , that they may fear i for ever , for the good of they , and of they child after they :
and i will make a everlasting covenant with they , that i will not turn away from they , to do they good ; but i will put my fear in they heart , that they shall not depart from i .
yea , i will rejoice over they to do they good , and i will plant they in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul .
for thus saith the lord ; like as i have bring all this great evil upon this people , so will i bring upon they all the good that i have promise they .
and field shall be buy in this land , whereof ye say , it be desolate without man or beast ; it be give into the hand of the chaldeans .
man shall buy field for money , and subscribe evidence , and seal they , and take witness in the land of benjamin , and in the place about jerusalem , and in the city of judah , and in the city of the mountain , and in the city of the valley , and in the city of the south : for i will cause they captivity to return , saith the lord .
moreover the word of the lord come unto jeremiah the second time , while he be yet shut up in the court of the prison , say ,
thus saith the lord the maker thereof , the lord that form it , to establish it ; the lord be he name ;
call unto i , and i will answer thee , and shew thee great and mighty thing , which thou knowest not .
for thus saith the lord , the god of israel , concern the house of this city , and concern the house of the king of judah , which be throw down by the mount , and by the sword ;
they come to fight with the chaldeans , but it be to fill they with the dead body of man , whom i have slay in mine anger and in my fury , and for all whose wickedness i have hide my face from this city .
behold , i will bring it health and cure , and i will cure they , and will reveal unto they the abundance of peace and truth .
and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return , and will build they , as at the first .
and i will cleanse they from all they iniquity , whereby they have sin against i ; and i will pardon all they iniquity , whereby they have sin , and whereby they have transgress against i .
and it shall be to i a name of joy , a praise and a honour before all the nation of the earth , which shall hear all the good that i do unto they : and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that i procure unto it .
thus saith the lord ; again there shall be hear in this place , which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast , even in the city of judah , and in the street of jerusalem , that be desolate , without man , and without inhabitant , and without beast ,
the voice of joy , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride , the voice of they that shall say , praise the lord of host : for the lord be good ; for he mercy endureth for ever : and of they that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord .
for i will cause to return the captivity of the land , as at the first , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord of host ; again in this place , which be desolate without man and without beast , and in all the city thereof , shall be a habitation of shepherd cause they flock to lie down .
in the city of the mountain , in the city of the vale , and in the city of the south , and in the land of benjamin , and in the place about jerusalem , and in the city of judah , shall the flock pass again under the hand of he that telleth they , saith the lord .
behold , the day come , saith the lord , that i will perform that good thing which i have promise unto the house of israel and to the house of judah .
in those day , and at that time , will i cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david ; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land .
in those day shall judah be save , and jerusalem shall dwell safely : and this be the name wherewith she shall be call , the lord we righteousness .
for thus saith the lord ; david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel ;
neither shall the priest the levites want a man before i to offer burnt offering , and to kindle meat offering , and to do sacrifice continually .
and the word of the lord come unto jeremiah , say ,
thus saith the lord ; if ye can break my covenant of the day , and my covenant of the night , and that there should not be day and night in they season ;
then may also my covenant be break with david my servant , that he should not have a son to reign upon he throne ; and with the levites the priest , my minister .
as the host of heaven can not be number , neither the sand of the sea measure : so will i multiply the seed of david my servant , and the levites that minister unto i .
moreover the word of the lord come to jeremiah , say ,
considerest thou not what this people have speak , say , the two family which the lord have choose , he have even cast they off ? thus they have despise my people , that they should be no more a nation before they .
thus saith the lord ; if my covenant be not with day and night , and if i have not appoint the ordinance of heaven and earth ;
then will i cast away the seed of jacob , and david my servant , so that i will not take any of he seed to be ruler over the seed of abraham , isaac , and jacob : for i will cause they captivity to return , and have mercy on they .
the word which come unto jeremiah from the lord , when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon , and all he army , and all the kingdom of the earth of he dominion , and all the people , fight against jerusalem , and against all the city thereof , say ,
thus saith the lord , the god of israel ; go and speak to zedekiah king of judah , and tell he , thus saith the lord ; behold , i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
and thou shalt not escape out of he hand , but shalt surely be take , and deliver into he hand ; and thine eye shall behold the eye of the king of babylon , and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth , and thou shalt go to babylon .
yet hear the word of the lord , o zedekiah king of judah ; thus saith the lord of thee , thou shalt not die by the sword :
but thou shalt die in peace : and with the burning of thy father , the former king which be before thee , so shall they burn odour for thee ; and they will lament thee , say , ah lord ! for i have pronounce the word , saith the lord .
then jeremiah the prophet speak all these word unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem ,
when the king of babylon 's army fight against jerusalem , and against all the city of judah that be leave , against lachish , and against azekah : for these defenced city remain of the city of judah .
this be the word that come unto jeremiah from the lord , after that the king zedekiah have make a covenant with all the people which be at jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto they ;
that every man should let he manservant , and every man he maidservant , be a hebrew or a hebrewess , go free ; that none should serve himself of they , to wit , of a jew he brother .
now when all the prince , and all the people , which have enter into the covenant , hear that every one should let he manservant , and every one he maidservant , go free , that none should serve themselves of they any more , then they obey , and let they go .
but afterward they turn , and cause the servant and the handmaid , whom they have let go free , to return , and bring they into subjection for servant and for handmaid .
therefore the word of the lord come to jeremiah from the lord , say ,
thus saith the lord , the god of israel ; i make a covenant with you father in the day that i bring they forth out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondmen , say ,
at the end of seven year let ye go every man he brother a hebrew , which have be sell unto thee ; and when he have serve thee six year , thou shalt let he go free from thee : but you father hearken not unto i , neither incline they ear .
and ye be now turn , and have do right in my sight , in proclaim liberty every man to he neighbour ; and ye have make a covenant before i in the house which be call by my name :
but ye turn and polluted my name , and cause every man he servant , and every man he handmaid , whom he have set at liberty at they pleasure , to return , and bring they into subjection , to be unto you for servant and for handmaid .
therefore thus saith the lord ; ye have not hearken unto i , in proclaim liberty , every one to he brother , and every man to he neighbour : behold , i proclaim a liberty for you , saith the lord , to the sword , to the pestilence , and to the famine ; and i will make you to be remove into all the kingdom of the earth .
and i will give the man that have transgress my covenant , which have not perform the word of the covenant which they have make before i , when they cut the calf in twain , and pass between the part thereof ,
the prince of judah , and the prince of jerusalem , the eunuch , and the priest , and all the people of the land , which pass between the part of the calf ;
i will even give they into the hand of they enemy , and into the hand of they that seek they life : and they dead body shall be for meat unto the fowl of the heaven , and to the beast of the earth .
and zedekiah king of judah and he prince will i give into the hand of they enemy , and into the hand of they that seek they life , and into the hand of the king of babylon 's army , which be go up from you .
behold , i will command , saith the lord , and cause they to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire : and i will make the city of judah a desolation without a inhabitant .
the word which come unto jeremiah from the lord in the day of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , say ,
go unto the house of the rechabites , and speak unto they , and bring they into the house of the lord , into one of the chamber , and give they wine to drink .
then i take jaazaniah the son of jeremiah , the son of habaziniah , and he brethren , and all he son , and the whole house of the rechabites ;
and i bring they into the house of the lord , into the chamber of the son of hanan , the son of igdaliah , a man of god , which be by the chamber of the prince , which be above the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum , the keeper of the door :
and i set before the son of the house of the rechabites pot full of wine , and cup , and i say unto they , drink ye wine .
but they say , we will drink no wine : for jonadab the son of rechab we father command we , say , ye shall drink no wine , neither ye , nor you son for ever :
neither shall ye build house , nor sow seed , nor plant vineyard , nor have any : but all you day ye shall dwell in tent ; that ye may live many day in the land where ye be stranger .
thus have we obey the voice of jonadab the son of rechab we father in all that he have charge we , to drink no wine all we day , we , we wife , we son , nor we daughter ;
nor to build house for we to dwell in : neither have we vineyard , nor field , nor seed :
but we have dwell in tent , and have obey , and do accord to all that jonadab we father command we .
but it come to pass , when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon come up into the land , that we say , come , and let we go to jerusalem for fear of the army of the chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the syrians : so we dwell at jerusalem .
then come the word of the lord unto jeremiah , say ,
thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; go and tell the man of judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem , will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my word ? saith the lord .
the word of jonadab the son of rechab , that he command he son not to drink wine , be perform ; for unto this day they drink none , but obey they father 's commandment : notwithstanding i have speak unto you , rise early and speaking ; but ye hearken not unto i .
i have send also unto you all my servant the prophet , rise up early and send they , say , return ye now every man from he evil way , and amend you doings , and go not after other god to serve they , and ye shall dwell in the land which i have give to you and to you father : but ye have not inclined you ear , nor hearken unto i .
because the son of jonadab the son of rechab have perform the commandment of they father , which he command they ; but this people have not hearken unto i :
therefore thus saith the lord god of host , the god of israel ; behold , i will bring upon judah and upon all the inhabitant of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounce against they : because i have speak unto they , but they have not hear ; and i have call unto they , but they have not answer .
and jeremiah say unto the house of the rechabites , thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; because ye have obey the commandment of jonadab you father , and keep all he precept , and do accord unto all that he have command you :
therefore thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before i for ever .
and it come to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , that this word come unto jeremiah from the lord , say ,
take thee a roll of a book , and write therein all the word that i have speak unto thee against israel , and against judah , and against all the nation , from the day i speak unto thee , from the day of josiah , even unto this day .
it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto they ; that they may return every man from he evil way ; that i may forgive they iniquity and they sin .
then jeremiah call baruch the son of neriah : and baruch write from the mouth of jeremiah all the word of the lord , which he have speak unto he , upon a roll of a book .
and jeremiah command baruch , say , i be shut up ; i can not go into the house of the lord :
therefore go thou , and read in the roll , which thou hast write from my mouth , the word of the lord in the ear of the people in the lord 's house upon the fasting day : and also thou shalt read they in the ear of all judah that come out of they city .
it may be they will present they supplication before the lord , and will return every one from he evil way : for great be the anger and the fury that the lord have pronounce against this people .
and baruch the son of neriah do accord to all that jeremiah the prophet command he , read in the book the word of the lord in the lord 's house .
and it come to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , in the ninth month , that they proclaim a fast before the lord to all the people in jerusalem , and to all the people that come from the city of judah unto jerusalem .
then read baruch in the book the word of jeremiah in the house of the lord , in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the lord 's house , in the ear of all the people .
when michaiah the son of gemariah , the son of shaphan , have hear out of the book all the word of the lord ,
then he go down into the king 's house , into the scribe 's chamber : and , lo , all the prince sit there , even elishama the scribe , and delaiah the son of shemaiah , and elnathan the son of achbor , and gemariah the son of shaphan , and zedekiah the son of hananiah , and all the prince .
then michaiah declare unto they all the word that he have hear , when baruch read the book in the ear of the people .
therefore all the prince send jehudi the son of nethaniah , the son of shelemiah , the son of cushi , unto baruch , say , take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ear of the people , and come .
so baruch the son of neriah take the roll in he hand , and come unto they .
and they say unto he , sit down now , and read it in we ear .
so baruch read it in they ear .
now it come to pass , when they have hear all the word , they be afraid both one and other , and say unto baruch , we will surely tell the king of all these word .
and they ask baruch , say , tell we now , how didst thou write all these word at he mouth ?
then baruch answer they , he pronounce all these word unto i with he mouth , and i write they with ink in the book .
then say the prince unto baruch , go , hide thee , thou and jeremiah ; and let no man know where ye be .
and they go in to the king into the court , but they lay up the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe , and tell all the word in the ear of the king .
so the king send jehudi to fetch the roll : and he take it out of elishama the scribe 's chamber .
and jehudi read it in the ear of the king , and in the ear of all the prince which stand beside the king .
now the king sit in the winterhouse in the ninth month : and there be a fire on the hearth burning before he .
and it come to pass , that when jehudi have read three or four leaf , he cut it with the penknife , and cast it into the fire that be on the hearth , until all the roll be consume in the fire that be on the hearth .
yet they be not afraid , nor rent they garment , neither the king , nor any of he servant that hear all these word .
nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah have make intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll : but he would not hear they .
but the king command jerahmeel the son of hammelech , and seraiah the son of azriel , and shelemiah the son of abdeel , to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet : but the lord hide they .
then the word of the lord come to jeremiah , after that the king have burn the roll , and the word which baruch write at the mouth of jeremiah , say ,
take thee again another roll , and write in it all the former word that be in the first roll , which jehoiakim the king of judah have burn .
and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah , thus saith the lord ; thou hast burn this roll , say , why hast thou write therein , say , the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land , and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast ?
therefore thus saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah ; he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david : and he dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the frost .
and i will punish he and he seed and he servant for they iniquity ; and i will bring upon they , and upon the inhabitant of jerusalem , and upon the man of judah , all the evil that i have pronounce against they ; but they hearken not .
then take jeremiah another roll , and give it to baruch the scribe , the son of neriah ; who write therein from the mouth of jeremiah all the word of the book which jehoiakim king of judah have burn in the fire : and there be add besides unto they many like word .
and king zedekiah the son of josiah reign instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim , whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon make king in the land of judah .
but neither he , nor he servant , nor the people of the land , do hearken unto the word of the lord , which he speak by the prophet jeremiah .
and zedekiah the king send jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah , say , pray now unto the lord we god for we .
now jeremiah come in and go out among the people : for they have not put he into prison .
then pharaoh 's army be come forth out of egypt : and when the chaldeans that besiege jerusalem hear tiding of they , they depart from jerusalem .
then come the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah , say ,
thus saith the lord , the god of israel ; thus shall ye say to the king of judah , that send you unto i to enquire of i ; behold , pharaoh 's army , which be come forth to help you , shall return to egypt into they own land .
and the chaldeans shall come again , and fight against this city , and take it , and burn it with fire .
thus saith the lord ; deceive not yourselve , say , the chaldeans shall surely depart from we : for they shall not depart .
for though ye have smite the whole army of the chaldeans that fight against you , and there remain but wound man among they , yet should they rise up every man in he tent , and burn this city with fire .
and it come to pass , that when the army of the chaldeans be break up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh 's army ,
then jeremiah go forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin , to separate himself thence in the midst of the people .
and when he be in the gate of benjamin , a captain of the ward be there , whose name be irijah , the son of shelemiah , the son of hananiah ; and he take jeremiah the prophet , say , thou fallest away to the chaldeans .
then say jeremiah , it be false ; i fall not away to the chaldeans .
but he hearken not to he : so irijah take jeremiah , and bring he to the prince .
wherefore the prince be wroth with jeremiah , and smite he , and put he in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe : for they have make that the prison .
when jeremiah be enter into the dungeon , and into the cabin , and jeremiah have remain there many day ;
then zedekiah the king send , and take he out : and the king ask he secretly in he house , and say , be there any word from the lord ?
and jeremiah say , there be : for , say he , thou shalt be deliver into the hand of the king of babylon .
moreover jeremiah say unto king zedekiah , what have i offend against thee , or against thy servant , or against this people , that ye have put i in prison ?
where be now you prophet which prophesy unto you , say , the king of babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
therefore hear now , i pray thee , o my lord the king : let my supplication , i pray thee , be accept before thee ; that thou cause i not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe , lest i die there .
then zedekiah the king command that they should commit jeremiah into the court of the prison , and that they should give he daily a piece of bread out of the baker ' street , until all the bread in the city be spend .
thus jeremiah remain in the court of the prison .
then shephatiah the son of mattan , and gedaliah the son of pashur , and jucal the son of shelemiah , and pashur the son of malchiah , hear the word that jeremiah have speak unto all the people , say ,
thus saith the lord , he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live ; for he shall have he life for a prey , and shall live .
thus saith the lord , this city shall surely be give into the hand of the king of babylon 's army , which shall take it .
therefore the prince say unto the king , we beseech thee , let this man be put to death : for thus he weakeneth the hand of the man of war that remain in this city , and the hand of all the people , in speak such word unto they : for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people , but the hurt .
then zedekiah the king say , behold , he be in you hand : for the king be not he that can do any thing against you .
then take they jeremiah , and cast he into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech , that be in the court of the prison : and they let down jeremiah with cord .
and in the dungeon there be no water , but mire : so jeremiah sink in the mire .
now when ebedmelech the ethiopian , one of the eunuch which be in the king 's house , hear that they have put jeremiah in the dungeon ; the king then sit in the gate of benjamin ;
ebedmelech go forth out of the king 's house , and spake to the king , say ,
my lord the king , these man have do evil in all that they have do to jeremiah the prophet , whom they have cast into the dungeon ; and he be like to die for hunger in the place where he be : for there be no more bread in the city .
then the king command ebedmelech the ethiopian , say , take from hence thirty man with thee , and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon , before he die .
so ebedmelech take the man with he , and go into the house of the king under the treasury , and take thence old cast clout and old rotten rag , and let they down by cord into the dungeon to jeremiah .
and ebedmelech the ethiopian say unto jeremiah , put now these old cast clout and rotten rag under thine armhole under the cord .
and jeremiah do so .
so they draw up jeremiah with cord , and take he up out of the dungeon : and jeremiah remain in the court of the prison .
then zedekiah the king send , and take jeremiah the prophet unto he into the third entry that be in the house of the lord : and the king say unto jeremiah , i will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from i .
then jeremiah say unto zedekiah , if i declare it unto thee , wilt thou not surely put i to death ? and if i give thee counsel , wilt thou not hearken unto i ?
so zedekiah the king sware secretly unto jeremiah , say , as the lord liveth , that make we this soul , i will not put thee to death , neither will i give thee into the hand of these man that seek thy life .
then say jeremiah unto zedekiah , thus saith the lord , the god of host , the god of israel ; if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of babylon 's prince , then thy soul shall live , and this city shall not be burn with fire ; and thou shalt live , and thine house :
but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylon 's prince , then shall this city be give into the hand of the chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of they hand .
and zedekiah the king say unto jeremiah , i be afraid of the jews that be fall to the chaldeans , lest they deliver i into they hand , and they mock i .
but jeremiah say , they shall not deliver thee .
obey , i beseech thee , the voice of the lord , which i speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and thy soul shall live .
but if thou refuse to go forth , this be the word that the lord have shew i :
and , behold , all the woman that be leave in the king of judah 's house shall be bring forth to the king of babylon 's prince , and those woman shall say , thy friend have set thee on , and have prevail against thee : thy foot be sink in the mire , and they be turn away back .
so they shall bring out all thy wife and thy child to the chaldeans : and thou shalt not escape out of they hand , but shalt be take by the hand of the king of babylon : and thou shalt cause this city to be burn with fire .
then say zedekiah unto jeremiah , let no man know of these word , and thou shalt not die .
but if the prince hear that i have talk with thee , and they come unto thee , and say unto thee , declare unto we now what thou hast say unto the king , hide it not from we , and we will not put thee to death ; also what the king say unto thee :
then thou shalt say unto they , i present my supplication before the king , that he would not cause i to return to jonathan 's house , to die there .
then come all the prince unto jeremiah , and ask he : and he tell they accord to all these word that the king have command .
so they leave off speak with he ; for the matter be not perceive .
so jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that jerusalem be take : and he be there when jerusalem be take .
in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah , in the tenth month , come nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all he army against jerusalem , and they besiege it .
and in the eleventh year of zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , the city be break up .
and all the prince of the king of babylon come in , and sit in the middle gate , even nergalsharezer , samgarnebo , sarsechim , rabsaris , nergalsharezer , rabmag , with all the residue of the prince of the king of babylon .
and it come to pass , that when zedekiah the king of judah see they , and all the man of war , then they flee , and go forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's garden , by the gate betwixt the two wall : and he go out the way of the plain .
but the chaldeans ' army pursue after they , and overtake zedekiah in the plain of jericho : and when they have take he , they bring he up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath , where he give judgment upon he .
then the king of babylon slew the son of zedekiah in riblah before he eye : also the king of babylon slew all the noble of judah .
moreover he put out zedekiah 's eye , and bind he with chain , to carry he to babylon .
and the chaldeans burn the king 's house , and the house of the people , with fire , and brake down the wall of jerusalem .
then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive into babylon the remnant of the people that remain in the city , and those that fall away , that fall to he , with the rest of the people that remain .
but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which have nothing , in the land of judah , and give they vineyard and field at the same time .
now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon give charge concern jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , say ,
take he , and look well to he , and do he no harm ; but do unto he even as he shall say unto thee .
so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard send , and nebushasban , rabsaris , and nergalsharezer , rabmag , and all the king of babylon 's prince ;
even they send , and take jeremiah out of the court of the prison , and commit he unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan , that he should carry he home : so he dwell among the people .
now the word of the lord come unto jeremiah , while he be shut up in the court of the prison , say ,
go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian , say , thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; behold , i will bring my word upon this city for evil , and not for good ; and they shall be accomplish in that day before thee .
but i will deliver thee in that day , saith the lord : and thou shalt not be give into the hand of the man of whom thou art afraid .
for i will surely deliver thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword , but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee : because thou hast put thy trust in i , saith the lord .
the word that come to jeremiah from the lord , after that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard have let he go from ramah , when he have take he be bind in chain among all that be carry away captive of jerusalem and judah , which be carry away captive unto babylon .
and the captain of the guard take jeremiah , and say unto he , the lord thy god have pronounced this evil upon this place .
now the lord have bring it , and do accord as he have say : because ye have sin against the lord , and have not obey he voice , therefore this thing be come upon you .
and now , behold , i loose thee this day from the chain which be upon thine hand .
if it seem good unto thee to come with i into babylon , come ; and i will look well unto thee : but if it seem ill unto thee to come with i into babylon , forbear : behold , all the land be before thee : whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go , thither go .
now while he be not yet go back , he say , go back also to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan , whom the king of babylon have make governor over the city of judah , and dwell with he among the people : or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go .
so the captain of the guard give he victuals and a reward , and let he go .
then go jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah ; and dwell with he among the people that be leave in the land .
now when all the captain of the force which be in the field , even they and they man , hear that the king of babylon have make gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land , and have commit unto he man , and woman , and child , and of the poor of the land , of they that be not carry away captive to babylon ;
then they come to gedaliah to mizpah , even ishmael the son of nethaniah , and johanan and jonathan the son of kareah , and seraiah the son of tanhumeth , and the son of ephai the netophathite , and jezaniah the son of a maachathite , they and they man .
and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto they and to they man , say , fear not to serve the chaldeans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of babylon , and it shall be well with you .
as for i , behold , i will dwell at mizpah , to serve the chaldeans , which will come unto we : but ye , gather ye wine , and summer fruit , and oil , and put they in you vessel , and dwell in you city that ye have take .
likewise when all the jews that be in moab , and among the ammonites , and in edom , and that be in all the country , hear that the king of babylon have leave a remnant of judah , and that he have set over they gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan ;
even all the jews return out of all place whither they be drive , and come to the land of judah , to gedaliah , unto mizpah , and gather wine and summer fruit very much .
moreover johanan the son of kareah , and all the captain of the force that be in the field , come to gedaliah to mizpah ,
and say unto he , dost thou certainly know that baalis the king of the ammonites have send ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee ?
but gedaliah the son of ahikam believe they not .
then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah secretly , say , let i go , i pray thee , and i will slay ishmael the son of nethaniah , and no man shall know it : wherefore should he slay thee , that all the jews which be gather unto thee should be scatter , and the remnant in judah perish ?
but gedaliah the son of ahikam say unto johanan the son of kareah , thou shalt not do this thing : for thou speakest falsely of ishmael .
now it come to pass in the seventh month , that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama , of the seed royal , and the prince of the king , even ten man with he , come unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah ; and there they do eat bread together in mizpah .
then arise ishmael the son of nethaniah , and the ten man that be with he , and smite gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword , and slew he , whom the king of babylon have make governor over the land .
ishmael also slew all the jews that be with he , even with gedaliah , at mizpah , and the chaldeans that be find there , and the man of war .
and it come to pass the second day after he have slay gedaliah , and no man know it ,
that there come certain from shechem , from shiloh , and from samaria , even fourscore man , have they beard shave , and they clothes rent , and have cut themselves , with offering and incense in they hand , to bring they to the house of the lord .
and ishmael the son of nethaniah go forth from mizpah to meet they , weep all along as he go : and it come to pass , as he meet they , he say unto they , come to gedaliah the son of ahikam .
and it be so , when they come into the midst of the city , that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew they , and cast they into the midst of the pit , he , and the man that be with he .
but ten man be find among they that say unto ishmael , slay we not : for we have treasure in the field , of wheat , and of barley , and of oil , and of honey .
so he forbare , and slew they not among they brethren .
now the pit wherein ishmael have cast all the dead body of the man , whom he have slay because of gedaliah , be it which asa the king have make for fear of baasha king of israel : and ishmael the son of nethaniah fill it with they that be slay .
then ishmael carry away captive all the residue of the people that be in mizpah , even the king 's daughter , and all the people that remain in mizpah , whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard have commit to gedaliah the son of ahikam : and ishmael the son of nethaniah carry they away captive , and depart to go over to the ammonites .
but when johanan the son of kareah , and all the captain of the force that be with he , hear of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah have do ,
then they take all the man , and go to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah , and find he by the great water that be in gibeon .
now it come to pass , that when all the people which be with ishmael see johanan the son of kareah , and all the captain of the force that be with he , then they be glad .
so all the people that ishmael have carry away captive from mizpah cast about and return , and go unto johanan the son of kareah .
but ishmael the son of nethaniah escape from johanan with eight man , and go to the ammonites .
then take johanan the son of kareah , and all the captain of the force that be with he , all the remnant of the people whom he have recover from ishmael the son of nethaniah , from mizpah , after that he have slay gedaliah the son of ahikam , even mighty man of war , and the woman , and the child , and the eunuch , whom he have bring again from gibeon :
and they depart , and dwelt in the habitation of chimham , which be by bethlehem , to go to enter into egypt ,
because of the chaldeans : for they be afraid of they , because ishmael the son of nethaniah have slay gedaliah the son of ahikam , whom the king of babylon make governor in the land .
then all the captain of the force , and johanan the son of kareah , and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah , and all the people from the least even unto the greatest , come near ,
and say unto jeremiah the prophet , let , we beseech thee , we supplication be accept before thee , and pray for we unto the lord thy god , even for all this remnant ; ( for we be leave but a few of many , as thine eye do behold we : )
that the lord thy god may shew we the way wherein we may walk , and the thing that we may do .
then jeremiah the prophet say unto they , i have hear you ; behold , i will pray unto the lord you god accord to you word ; and it shall come to pass , that whatsoever thing the lord shall answer you , i will declare it unto you ; i will keep nothing back from you .
then they say to jeremiah , the lord be a true and faithful witness between we , if we do not even accord to all thing for the which the lord thy god shall send thee to we .
whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of the lord we god , to whom we send thee ; that it may be well with we , when we obey the voice of the lord we god .
and it come to pass after ten day , that the word of the lord come unto jeremiah .
then call he johanan the son of kareah , and all the captain of the force which be with he , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
and say unto they , thus saith the lord , the god of israel , unto whom ye send i to present you supplication before he ;
if ye will still abide in this land , then will i build you , and not pull you down , and i will plant you , and not pluck you up : for i repent i of the evil that i have do unto you .
be not afraid of the king of babylon , of whom ye be afraid ; be not afraid of he , saith the lord : for i be with you to save you , and to deliver you from he hand .
and i will shew mercy unto you , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to you own land .
but if ye say , we will not dwell in this land , neither obey the voice of the lord you god ,
say , no ; but we will go into the land of egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
and now therefore hear the word of the lord , ye remnant of judah ; thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; if ye wholly set you face to enter into egypt , and go to sojourn there ;
then it shall come to pass , that the sword , which ye fear , shall overtake you there in the land of egypt , and the famine , whereof ye be afraid , shall follow close after you there in egypt ; and there ye shall die .
so shall it be with all the man that set they face to go into egypt to sojourn there ; they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : and none of they shall remain or escape from the evil that i will bring upon they .
for thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; as mine anger and my fury have be pour forth upon the inhabitant of jerusalem ; so shall my fury be pour forth upon you , when ye shall enter into egypt : and ye shall be a execration , and a astonishment , and a curse , and a reproach ; and ye shall see this place no more .
the lord have say concern you , o ye remnant of judah ; go ye not into egypt : know certainly that i have admonish you this day .
for ye dissemble in you heart , when ye send i unto the lord you god , say , pray for we unto the lord we god ; and accord unto all that the lord we god shall say , so declare unto we , and we will do it .
and now i have this day declare it to you ; but ye have not obey the voice of the lord you god , nor any thing for the which he have send i unto you .
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn .
and it come to pass , that when jeremiah have make a end of speak unto all the people all the word of the lord they god , for which the lord they god have send he to they , even all these word ,
then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah , and johanan the son of kareah , and all the proud man , say unto jeremiah , thou speakest falsely : the lord we god have not send thee to say , go not into egypt to sojourn there :
but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on against we , for to deliver we into the hand of the chaldeans , that they might put we to death , and carry we away captive into babylon .
so johanan the son of kareah , and all the captain of the force , and all the people , obey not the voice of the lord , to dwell in the land of judah .
but johanan the son of kareah , and all the captain of the force , take all the remnant of judah , that be return from all nation , whither they have be drive , to dwell in the land of judah ;
even man , and woman , and child , and the king 's daughter , and every person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard have leave with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan , and jeremiah the prophet , and baruch the son of neriah .
so they come into the land of egypt : for they obey not the voice of the lord : thus come they even to tahpanhes .
then come the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanhes , say ,
take great stone in thine hand , and hide they in the clay in the brickkiln , which be at the entry of pharaoh 's house in tahpanhes , in the sight of the man of judah ;
and say unto they , thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; behold , i will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon , my servant , and will set he throne upon these stone that i have hide ; and he shall spread he royal pavilion over they .
and when he cometh , he shall smite the land of egypt , and deliver such as be for death to death ; and such as be for captivity to captivity ; and such as be for the sword to the sword .
and i will kindle a fire in the house of the god of egypt ; and he shall burn they , and carry they away captive : and he shall array himself with the land of egypt , as a shepherd putteth on he garment ; and he shall go forth from thence in peace .
he shall break also the image of bethshemesh , that be in the land of egypt ; and the house of the god of the egyptians shall he burn with fire .
the word that come to jeremiah concern all the jews which dwell in the land of egypt , which dwell at migdol , and at tahpanhes , and at noph , and in the country of pathros , say ,
thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; ye have see all the evil that i have bring upon jerusalem , and upon all the city of judah ; and , behold , this day they be a desolation , and no man dwelleth therein ,
because of they wickedness which they have commit to provoke i to anger , in that they go to burn incense , and to serve other god , whom they know not , neither they , ye , nor you father .
howbeit i send unto you all my servant the prophet , rise early and send they , say , oh , do not this abominable thing that i hate .
but they hearken not , nor inclined they ear to turn from they wickedness , to burn no incense unto other god .
wherefore my fury and mine anger be pour forth , and be kindle in the city of judah and in the street of jerusalem ; and they be waste and desolate , as at this day .
therefore now thus saith the lord , the god of host , the god of israel ; wherefore commit ye this great evil against you soul , to cut off from you man and woman , child and suckling , out of judah , to leave you none to remain ;
in that ye provoke i unto wrath with the work of you hand , burn incense unto other god in the land of egypt , whither ye be go to dwell , that ye might cut yourselve off , and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nation of the earth ?
have ye forget the wickedness of you father , and the wickedness of the king of judah , and the wickedness of they wife , and you own wickedness , and the wickedness of you wife , which they have commit in the land of judah , and in the street of jerusalem ?
they be not humble even unto this day , neither have they fear , nor walk in my law , nor in my statute , that i set before you and before you father .
therefore thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; behold , i will set my face against you for evil , and to cut off all judah .
and i will take the remnant of judah , that have set they face to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there , and they shall all be consume , and fall in the land of egypt ; they shall even be consume by the sword and by the famine : they shall die , from the least even unto the greatest , by the sword and by the famine : and they shall be a execration , and a astonishment , and a curse , and a reproach .
for i will punish they that dwell in the land of egypt , as i have punish jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence :
so that none of the remnant of judah , which be go into the land of egypt to sojourn there , shall escape or remain , that they should return into the land of judah , to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there : for none shall return but such as shall escape .
then all the man which know that they wife have burn incense unto other god , and all the woman that stand by , a great multitude , even all the people that dwell in the land of egypt , in pathros , answer jeremiah , say ,
as for the word that thou hast speak unto we in the name of the lord , we will not hearken unto thee .
but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of we own mouth , to burn incense unto the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offering unto she , as we have do , we , and we father , we king , and we prince , in the city of judah , and in the street of jerusalem : for then have we plenty of victuals , and be well , and see no evil .
but since we leave off to burn incense to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offering unto she , we have want all thing , and have be consume by the sword and by the famine .
and when we burn incense to the queen of heaven , and pour out drink offering unto she , do we make she cake to worship she , and pour out drink offering unto she , without we man ?
then jeremiah say unto all the people , to the man , and to the woman , and to all the people which have give he that answer , say ,
the incense that ye burn in the city of judah , and in the street of jerusalem , ye , and you father , you king , and you prince , and the people of the land , do not the lord remember they , and come it not into he mind ?
so that the lord could no longer bear , because of the evil of you doings , and because of the abomination which ye have commit ; therefore be you land a desolation , and a astonishment , and a curse , without a inhabitant , as at this day .
because ye have burn incense , and because ye have sin against the lord , and have not obey the voice of the lord , nor walk in he law , nor in he statute , nor in he testimony ; therefore this evil be happen unto you , as at this day .
moreover jeremiah say unto all the people , and to all the woman , hear the word of the lord , all judah that be in the land of egypt :
thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel , say ; ye and you wife have both speak with you mouth , and fulfil with you hand , say , we will surely perform we vow that we have vow , to burn incense to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offering unto she : ye will surely accomplish you vow , and surely perform you vow .
therefore hear ye the word of the lord , all judah that dwell in the land of egypt ; behold , i have swear by my great name , saith the lord , that my name shall no more be name in the mouth of any man of judah in all the land of egypt , say , the lord god liveth .
behold , i will watch over they for evil , and not for good : and all the man of judah that be in the land of egypt shall be consume by the sword and by the famine , until there be a end of they .
yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of egypt into the land of judah , and all the remnant of judah , that be go into the land of egypt to sojourn there , shall know whose word shall stand , mine , or theirs .
and this shall be a sign unto you , saith the lord , that i will punish you in this place , that ye may know that my word shall surely stand against you for evil :
thus saith the lord ; behold , i will give pharaohhophra king of egypt into the hand of he enemy , and into the hand of they that seek he life ; as i give zedekiah king of judah into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , he enemy , and that seek he life .
the word that jeremiah the prophet spake unto baruch the son of neriah , when he have write these word in a book at the mouth of jeremiah , in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , say ,
thus saith the lord , the god of israel , unto thee , o baruch :
thou didst say , woe be i now ! for the lord have add grief to my sorrow ; i faint in my sighing , and i find no rest .
thus shalt thou say unto he , the lord saith thus ; behold , that which i have build will i break down , and that which i have plant i will pluck up , even this whole land .
and seekest thou great thing for thyself ? seek they not : for , behold , i will bring evil upon all flesh , saith the lord : but thy life will i give unto thee for a prey in all place whither thou goest .
the word of the lord which come to jeremiah the prophet against the gentiles ;
against egypt , against the army of pharaohnecho king of egypt , which be by the river euphrates in carchemish , which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah .
order ye the buckler and shield , and draw near to battle .
harness the horse ; and get up , ye horseman , and stand forth with you helmet ; furbish the spear , and put on the brigandine .
wherefore have i see they dismayed and turn away back ? and they mighty one be beat down , and be flee apace , and look not back : for fear be round about , saith the lord .
let not the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; they shall stumble , and fall toward the north by the river euphrates .
who be this that cometh up as a flood , whose water be move as the river ?
egypt riseth up like a flood , and he water be move like the river ; and he saith , i will go up , and will cover the earth ; i will destroy the city and the inhabitant thereof .
come up , ye horse ; and rage , ye chariot ; and let the mighty man come forth ; the ethiopians and the libyans , that handle the shield ; and the lydians , that handle and bend the bow .
for this be the day of the lord god of host , a day of vengeance , that he may avenge he of he adversary : and the sword shall devour , and it shall be satiate and make drunk with they blood : for the lord god of host have a sacrifice in the north country by the river euphrates .
go up into gilead , and take balm , o virgin , the daughter of egypt : in vain shalt thou use many medicine ; for thou shalt not be cure .
the nation have hear of thy shame , and thy cry have fill the land : for the mighty man have stumble against the mighty , and they be fall both together .
the word that the lord spake to jeremiah the prophet , how nebuchadrezzar king of babylon should come and smite the land of egypt .
declare ye in egypt , and publish in migdol , and publish in noph and in tahpanhes : say ye , stand fast , and prepare thee ; for the sword shall devour round about thee .
why be thy valiant man sweep away ? they stand not , because the lord do drive they .
he make many to fall , yea , one fall upon another : and they say , arise , and let we go again to we own people , and to the land of we nativity , from the oppress sword .
they do cry there , pharaoh king of egypt be but a noise ; he have pass the time appoint .
as i live , saith the king , whose name be the lord of host , surely as tabor be among the mountain , and as carmel by the sea , so shall he come .
o thou daughter dwelling in egypt , furnish thyself to go into captivity : for noph shall be waste and desolate without a inhabitant .
egypt be like a very fair heifer , but destruction cometh ; it cometh out of the north .
also she hire man be in the midst of she like fatted bullock ; for they also be turn back , and be flee away together : they do not stand , because the day of they calamity be come upon they , and the time of they visitation .
the voice thereof shall go like a serpent ; for they shall march with a army , and come against she with axis , as hewer of wood .
they shall cut down she forest , saith the lord , though it can not be search ; because they be more than the grasshopper , and be innumerable .
the daughter of egypt shall be confound ; she shall be deliver into the hand of the people of the north .
the lord of host , the god of israel , saith ; behold , i will punish the multitude of no , and pharaoh , and egypt , with they god , and they king ; even pharaoh , and all they that trust in he :
and i will deliver they into the hand of those that seek they life , and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , and into the hand of he servant : and afterward it shall be inhabit , as in the day of old , saith the lord .
but fear not thou , o my servant jacob , and be not dismayed , o israel : for , behold , i will save thee from afar off , and thy seed from the land of they captivity ; and jacob shall return , and be in rest and at ease , and none shall make he afraid .
fear thou not , o jacob my servant , saith the lord : for i be with thee ; for i will make a full end of all the nation whither i have drive thee : but i will not make a full end of thee , but correct thee in measure ; yet will i not leave thee wholly unpunished .
the word of the lord that come to jeremiah the prophet against the philistines , before that pharaoh smite gaza .
thus saith the lord ; behold , water rise up out of the north , and shall be a overflow flood , and shall overflow the land , and all that be therein ; the city , and they that dwell therein : then the man shall cry , and all the inhabitant of the land shall howl .
at the noise of the stamp of the hoof of he strong horse , at the rush of he chariot , and at the rumble of he wheel , the father shall not look back to they child for feebleness of hand ;
because of the day that cometh to spoil all the philistines , and to cut off from tyrus and zidon every helper that remaineth : for the lord will spoil the philistines , the remnant of the country of caphtor .
baldness be come upon gaza ; ashkelon be cut off with the remnant of they valley : how long wilt thou cut thyself ?
o thou sword of the lord , how long will it be ere thou be quiet ? put up thyself into thy scabbard , rest , and be still .
how can it be quiet , see the lord have give it a charge against ashkelon , and against the sea shore ? there have he appoint it .
against moab thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; woe unto nebo ! for it be spoil : kiriathaim be confound and take : misgab be confound and dismay .
there shall be no more praise of moab : in heshbon they have devise evil against it ; come , and let we cut it off from be a nation .
also thou shalt be cut down , o madmen ; the sword shall pursue thee .
a voice of cry shall be from horonaim , spoil and great destruction .
moab be destroy ; she little one have cause a cry to be hear .
for in the go up of luhith continual weep shall go up ; for in the go down of horonaim the enemy have hear a cry of destruction .
flee , save you life , and be like the heath in the wilderness .
for because thou hast trust in thy work and in thy treasure , thou shalt also be take : and chemosh shall go forth into captivity with he priest and he prince together .
and the spoiler shall come upon every city , and no city shall escape : the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroy , as the lord have speak .
give wing unto moab , that it may flee and get away : for the city thereof shall be desolate , without any to dwell therein .
curse be he that doeth the work of the lord deceitfully , and curse be he that keepeth back he sword from blood .
moab have be at ease from he youth , and he have settle on he lees , and have not be empty from vessel to vessel , neither have he go into captivity : therefore he taste remain in he , and he scent be not change .
therefore , behold , the day come , saith the lord , that i will send unto he wanderer , that shall cause he to wander , and shall empty he vessel , and break they bottle .
and moab shall be ashamed of chemosh , as the house of israel be ashamed of bethel they confidence .
how say ye , we be mighty and strong man for the war ?
moab be spoil , and go up out of she city , and he choose young man be go down to the slaughter , saith the king , whose name be the lord of host .
the calamity of moab be near to come , and he affliction hasteth fast .
all ye that be about he , bemoan he ; and all ye that know he name , say , how be the strong staff break , and the beautiful rod !
thou daughter that dost inhabit dibon , come down from thy glory , and sit in thirst ; for the spoiler of moab shall come upon thee , and he shall destroy thy strong hold .
o inhabitant of aroer , stand by the way , and espy ; ask he that fleeth , and she that escapeth , and say , what be do ?
moab be confound ; for it be break down : howl and cry ; tell ye it in arnon , that moab be spoil ,
and judgment be come upon the plain country ; upon holon , and upon jahazah , and upon mephaath ,
and upon dibon , and upon nebo , and upon bethdiblathaim ,
and upon kiriathaim , and upon bethgamul , and upon bethmeon ,
and upon kerioth , and upon bozrah , and upon all the city of the land of moab , far or near .
the horn of moab be cut off , and he arm be break , saith the lord .
make ye he drunken : for he magnify himself against the lord : moab also shall wallow in he vomit , and he also shall be in derision .
for be not israel a derision unto thee ? be he find among thief ? for since thou spakest of he , thou skippedst for joy .
o ye that dwell in moab , leave the city , and dwell in the rock , and be like the dive that maketh she nest in the side of the hole 's mouth .
we have hear the pride of moab , ( he be exceed proud ) he loftiness , and he arrogancy , and he pride , and the haughtiness of he heart .
i know he wrath , saith the lord ; but it shall not be so ; he lie shall not so effect it .
therefore will i howl for moab , and i will cry out for all moab ; mine heart shall mourn for the man of kirheres .
o vine of sibmah , i will weep for thee with the weep of jazer : thy plant be go over the sea , they reach even to the sea of jazer : the spoiler be fall upon thy summer fruit and upon thy vintage .
and joy and gladness be take from the plentiful field , and from the land of moab ; and i have cause wine to fail from the winepress : none shall tread with shout ; they shouting shall be no shouting .
from the cry of heshbon even unto elealeh , and even unto jahaz , have they utter they voice , from zoar even unto horonaim , as a heifer of three year old : for the water also of nimrim shall be desolate .
moreover i will cause to cease in moab , saith the lord , he that offereth in the high place , and he that burneth incense to he god .
therefore mine heart shall sound for moab like pipe , and mine heart shall sound like pipe for the man of kirheres : because the riches that he have get be perish .
for every head shall be bald , and every beard clip : upon all the hand shall be cutting , and upon the loin sackcloth .
there shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of moab , and in the street thereof : for i have break moab like a vessel wherein be no pleasure , saith the lord .
they shall howl , say , how be it break down ! how have moab turn the back with shame ! so shall moab be a derision and a dismaying to all they about he .
for thus saith the lord ; behold , he shall fly as a eagle , and shall spread he wing over moab .
kerioth be take , and the strong hold be surprised , and the mighty man 's heart in moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in she pang .
and moab shall be destroy from be a people , because he have magnify himself against the lord .
fear , and the pit , and the snare , shall be upon thee , o inhabitant of moab , saith the lord .
he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be take in the snare : for i will bring upon it , even upon moab , the year of they visitation , saith the lord .
they that flee stand under the shadow of heshbon because of the force : but a fire shall come forth out of heshbon , and a flame from the midst of sihon , and shall devour the corner of moab , and the crown of the head of the tumultuous one .
woe be unto thee , o moab ! the people of chemosh perisheth : for thy son be take captive , and thy daughter captive .
yet will i bring again the captivity of moab in the latter day , saith the lord .
thus far be the judgment of moab .
concern the ammonites , thus saith the lord ; hath israel no son ? have he no heir ? why then doth they king inherit gad , and he people dwell in he city ?
therefore , behold , the day come , saith the lord , that i will cause a alarm of war to be hear in rabbah of the ammonites ; and it shall be a desolate heap , and she daughter shall be burn with fire : then shall israel be heir unto they that be he heir , saith the lord .
howl , o heshbon , for ai be spoil : cry , ye daughter of rabbah , gird you with sackcloth ; lament , and run to and fro by the hedge ; for they king shall go into captivity , and he priest and he prince together .
wherefore gloriest thou in the valley , thy flow valley , o backsliding daughter ? that trust in she treasure , say , who shall come unto i ?
behold , i will bring a fear upon thee , saith the lord god of host , from all those that be about thee ; and ye shall be drive out every man right forth ; and none shall gather up he that wandereth .
and afterward i will bring again the captivity of the child of ammon , saith the lord .
concern edom , thus saith the lord of host ; be wisdom no more in teman ? be counsel perish from the prudent ? be they wisdom vanish ?
flee ye , turn back , dwell deep , o inhabitant of dedan ; for i will bring the calamity of esau upon he , the time that i will visit he .
if grapegatherer come to thee , would they not leave some glean grape ? if thief by night , they will destroy till they have enough .
but i have make esau bare , i have uncover he secret place , and he shall not be able to hide himself : he seed be spoil , and he brethren , and he neighbour , and he be not .
leave thy fatherless child , i will preserve they alive ; and let thy widow trust in i .
for thus saith the lord ; behold , they whose judgment be not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken ; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished ? thou shalt not go unpunished , but thou shalt surely drink of it .
for i have swear by myself , saith the lord , that bozrah shall become a desolation , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the city thereof shall be perpetual waste .
i have hear a rumour from the lord , and a ambassador be send unto the heathen , say , gather ye together , and come against she , and rise up to the battle .
for , lo , i will make thee small among the heathen , and despise among man .
thy terribleness have deceive thee , and the pride of thine heart , o thou that dwellest in the cleft of the rock , that holdest the height of the hill : though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle , i will bring thee down from thence , saith the lord .
also edom shall be a desolation : every one that goeth by it shall be astonish , and shall hiss at all the plague thereof .
as in the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour city thereof , saith the lord , no man shall abide there , neither shall a son of man dwell in it .
behold , he shall come up like a lion from the swell of jordan against the habitation of the strong : but i will suddenly make he run away from she : and who be a choose man , that i may appoint over she ? for who be like i ? and who will appoint i the time ? and who be that shepherd that will stand before i ?
therefore hear the counsel of the lord , that he have take against edom ; and he purpose , that he have purpose against the inhabitant of teman : surely the least of the flock shall draw they out : surely he shall make they habitation desolate with they .
the earth be move at the noise of they fall , at the cry the noise thereof be hear in the red sea .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread he wing over bozrah : and at that day shall the heart of the mighty man of edom be as the heart of a woman in she pang .
concern damascus .
hamath be confound , and arpad : for they have hear evil tiding : they be faintheart ; there be sorrow on the sea ; it can not be quiet .
damascus be wax feeble , and turneth herself to flee , and fear have seize on she : anguish and sorrow have take she , as a woman in travail .
how be the city of praise not left , the city of my joy !
therefore she young man shall fall in she street , and all the man of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the lord of host .
and i will kindle a fire in the wall of damascus , and it shall consume the palace of benhadad .
concern kedar , and concern the kingdom of hazor , which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon shall smite , thus saith the lord ; arise ye , go up to kedar , and spoil the man of the east .
they tent and they flock shall they take away : they shall take to themselves they curtain , and all they vessel , and they camel ; and they shall cry unto they , fear be on every side .
flee , get you far off , dwell deep , o ye inhabitant of hazor , saith the lord ; for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon have take counsel against you , and have conceive a purpose against you .
arise , get you up unto the wealthy nation , that dwelleth without care , saith the lord , which have neither gate nor bar , which dwell alone .
and they camel shall be a booty , and the multitude of they cattle a spoil : and i will scatter into all wind they that be in the utmost corner ; and i will bring they calamity from all side thereof , saith the lord .
and hazor shall be a dwelling for dragon , and a desolation for ever : there shall no man abide there , nor any son of man dwell in it .
the word of the lord that come to jeremiah the prophet against elam in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah , say ,
thus saith the lord of host ; behold , i will break the bow of elam , the chief of they might .
and upon elam will i bring the four wind from the four quarter of heaven , and will scatter they toward all those wind ; and there shall be no nation whither the outcast of elam shall not come .
for i will cause elam to be dismay before they enemy , and before they that seek they life : and i will bring evil upon they , even my fierce anger , saith the lord ; and i will send the sword after they , till i have consume they :
and i will set my throne in elam , and will destroy from thence the king and the prince , saith the lord .
but it shall come to pass in the latter day , that i will bring again the captivity of elam , saith the lord .
the word that the lord spake against babylon and against the land of the chaldeans by jeremiah the prophet .
declare ye among the nation , and publish , and set up a standard ; publish , and conceal not : say , babylon be take , bel be confound , merodach be break in piece ; she idol be confound , she image be break in piece .
for out of the north there cometh up a nation against she , which shall make she land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they shall remove , they shall depart , both man and beast .
in those day , and in that time , saith the lord , the child of israel shall come , they and the child of judah together , go and weep : they shall go , and seek the lord they god .
they shall ask the way to zion with they face thitherward , say , come , and let we join ourselves to the lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forget .
my people have be lose sheep : they shepherd have cause they to go astray , they have turn they away on the mountain : they have go from mountain to hill , they have forget they restingplace .
all that find they have devour they : and they adversary say , we offend not , because they have sin against the lord , the habitation of justice , even the lord , the hope of they father .
remove out of the midst of babylon , and go forth out of the land of the chaldeans , and be as the he goat before the flock .
for , lo , i will raise and cause to come up against babylon a assembly of great nation from the north country : and they shall set themselves in array against she ; from thence she shall be take : they arrow shall be as of a mighty expert man ; none shall return in vain .
and chaldea shall be a spoil : all that spoil she shall be satisfy , saith the lord .
because ye be glad , because ye rejoice , o ye destroyer of mine heritage , because ye be grow fat as the heifer at grass , and bellow as bull ;
you mother shall be sore confound ; she that bare you shall be ashamed : behold , the hindermost of the nation shall be a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
because of the wrath of the lord it shall not be inhabit , but it shall be wholly desolate : every one that goeth by babylon shall be astonish , and hiss at all she plague .
put yourselve in array against babylon round about : all ye that bend the bow , shoot at she , spare no arrow : for she have sin against the lord .
shout against she round about : she have give she hand : she foundation be fall , she wall be throw down : for it be the vengeance of the lord : take vengeance upon she ; as she have do , do unto she .
cut off the sower from babylon , and he that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppress sword they shall turn every one to he people , and they shall flee every one to he own land .
israel be a scattered sheep ; the lion have drive he away : first the king of assyria have devour he ; and last this nebuchadrezzar king of babylon have break he bone .
therefore thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; behold , i will punish the king of babylon and he land , as i have punish the king of assyria .
and i will bring israel again to he habitation , and he shall feed on carmel and bashan , and he soul shall be satisfy upon mount ephraim and gilead .
in those day , and in that time , saith the lord , the iniquity of israel shall be seek for , and there shall be none ; and the sin of judah , and they shall not be find : for i will pardon they whom i reserve .
go up against the land of merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitant of pekod : waste and utterly destroy after they , saith the lord , and do accord to all that i have command thee .
a sound of battle be in the land , and of great destruction .
how be the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken ! how be babylon become a desolation among the nation !
i have lay a snare for thee , and thou art also take , o babylon , and thou wast not aware : thou art find , and also catch , because thou hast strive against the lord .
the lord have open he armoury , and have bring forth the weapon of he indignation : for this be the work of the lord god of host in the land of the chaldeans .
come against she from the utmost border , open she storehouse : cast she up as heap , and destroy she utterly : let nothing of she be leave .
slay all she bullock ; let they go down to the slaughter : woe unto they ! for they day be come , the time of they visitation .
the voice of they that flee and escape out of the land of babylon , to declare in zion the vengeance of the lord we god , the vengeance of he temple .
call together the archer against babylon : all ye that bend the bow , camp against it round about ; let none thereof escape : recompense she accord to she work ; accord to all that she have do , do unto she : for she have be proud against the lord , against the holy one of israel .
therefore shall she young man fall in the street , and all she man of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the lord .
behold , i be against thee , o thou most proud , saith the lord god of host : for thy day be come , the time that i will visit thee .
and the most proud shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise he up : and i will kindle a fire in he city , and it shall devour all round about he .
thus saith the lord of host ; the child of israel and the child of judah be oppress together : and all that take they captive hold they fast ; they refuse to let they go .
they redeemer be strong ; the lord of host be he name : he shall throughly plead they cause , that he may give rest to the land , and disquiet the inhabitant of babylon .
a sword be upon the chaldeans , saith the lord , and upon the inhabitant of babylon , and upon she prince , and upon she wise man .
a sword be upon the liar ; and they shall dote : a sword be upon she mighty man ; and they shall be dismayed .
a sword be upon they horse , and upon they chariot , and upon all the mingled people that be in the midst of she ; and they shall become as woman : a sword be upon she treasure ; and they shall be rob .
a drought be upon she water ; and they shall be dry up : for it be the land of graven image , and they be mad upon they idol .
therefore the wild beast of the desert with the wild beast of the island shall dwell there , and the owl shall dwell therein : and it shall be no more inhabit for ever ; neither shall it be dwell in from generation to generation .
as god overthrow sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour city thereof , saith the lord ; so shall no man abide there , neither shall any son of man dwell therein .
behold , a people shall come from the north , and a great nation , and many king shall be raise up from the coast of the earth .
they shall hold the bow and the lance : they be cruel , and will not shew mercy : they voice shall roar like the sea , and they shall ride upon horse , every one put in array , like a man to the battle , against thee , o daughter of babylon .
the king of babylon have hear the report of they , and he hand wax feeble : anguish take hold of he , and pang as of a woman in travail .
behold , he shall come up like a lion from the swell of jordan unto the habitation of the strong : but i will make they suddenly run away from she : and who be a choose man , that i may appoint over she ? for who be like i ? and who will appoint i the time ? and who be that shepherd that will stand before i ?
therefore hear ye the counsel of the lord , that he have take against babylon ; and he purpose , that he have purpose against the land of the chaldeans : surely the least of the flock shall draw they out : surely he shall make they habitation desolate with they .
at the noise of the taking of babylon the earth be move , and the cry be hear among the nation .
thus saith the lord ; behold , i will raise up against babylon , and against they that dwell in the midst of they that rise up against i , a destroy wind ;
and will send unto babylon fanner , that shall fan she , and shall empty she land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against she round about .
against he that bendeth let the archer bend he bow , and against he that lifteth himself up in he brigandine : and spare ye not she young man ; destroy ye utterly all she host .
thus the slay shall fall in the land of the chaldeans , and they that be thrust through in she street .
for israel have not be forsake , nor judah of he god , of the lord of host ; though they land be fill with sin against the holy one of israel .
flee out of the midst of babylon , and deliver every man he soul : be not cut off in she iniquity ; for this be the time of the lord 's vengeance ; he will render unto she a recompence .
babylon have be a golden cup in the lord 's hand , that make all the earth drunken : the nation have drunken of she wine ; therefore the nation be mad .
babylon be suddenly fall and destroy : howl for she ; take balm for she pain , if so be she may be heal .
we would have heal babylon , but she be not heal : forsake she , and let we go every one into he own country : for she judgment reacheth unto heaven , and be lift up even to the sky .
the lord have bring forth we righteousness : come , and let we declare in zion the work of the lord we god .
make bright the arrow ; gather the shield : the lord have raise up the spirit of the king of the medes : for he device be against babylon , to destroy it ; because it be the vengeance of the lord , the vengeance of he temple .
set up the standard upon the wall of babylon , make the watch strong , set up the watchman , prepare the ambush : for the lord have both devise and do that which he speak against the inhabitant of babylon .
o thou that dwellest upon many water , abundant in treasure , thine end be come , and the measure of thy covetousness .
the lord of host have swear by himself , say , surely i will fill thee with man , as with caterpiller ; and they shall lift up a shout against thee .
he have make the earth by he power , he have establish the world by he wisdom , and have stretch out the heaven by he understanding .
when he uttereth he voice , there be a multitude of water in the heaven ; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end of the earth : he maketh lightning with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of he treasure .
every man be brutish by he knowledge ; every founder be confound by the graven image : for he molten image be falsehood , and there be no breath in they .
they be vanity , the work of error : in the time of they visitation they shall perish .
the portion of jacob be not like they ; for he be the former of all thing : and israel be the rod of he inheritance : the lord of host be he name .
thou art my battle axe and weapon of war : for with thee will i break in piece the nation , and with thee will i destroy kingdom ;
and with thee will i break in piece the horse and he rider ; and with thee will i break in piece the chariot and he rider ;
with thee also will i break in piece man and woman ; and with thee will i break in piece old and young ; and with thee will i break in piece the young man and the maid ;
i will also break in piece with thee the shepherd and he flock ; and with thee will i break in piece the husbandman and he yoke of ox ; and with thee will i break in piece captain and ruler .
and i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabitant of chaldea all they evil that they have do in zion in you sight , saith the lord .
behold , i be against thee , o destroy mountain , saith the lord , which destroyest all the earth : and i will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rock , and will make thee a burnt mountain .
and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundation ; but thou shalt be desolate for ever , saith the lord .
set ye up a standard in the land , blow the trumpet among the nation , prepare the nation against she , call together against she the kingdom of ararat , minni , and ashchenaz ; appoint a captain against she ; cause the horse to come up as the rough caterpiller .
prepare against she the nation with the king of the medes , the captain thereof , and all the ruler thereof , and all the land of he dominion .
and the land shall tremble and sorrow : for every purpose of the lord shall be perform against babylon , to make the land of babylon a desolation without a inhabitant .
the mighty man of babylon have forborn to fight , they have remain in they hold : they might have fail ; they become as woman : they have burn she dwellingplace ; she bar be break .
one post shall run to meet another , and one messenger to meet another , to shew the king of babylon that he city be take at one end ,
and that the passage be stop , and the reed they have burn with fire , and the man of war be affright .
for thus saith the lord of host , the god of israel ; the daughter of babylon be like a threshingfloor , it be time to thresh she : yet a little while , and the time of she harvest shall come .
nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon have devour i , he have crushed i , he have make i a empty vessel , he have swallow i up like a dragon , he have fill he belly with my delicate , he have cast i out .
the violence do to i and to my flesh be upon babylon , shall the inhabitant of zion say ; and my blood upon the inhabitant of chaldea , shall jerusalem say .
therefore thus saith the lord ; behold , i will plead thy cause , and take vengeance for thee ; and i will dry up she sea , and make she spring dry .
and babylon shall become heap , a dwellingplace for dragon , a astonishment , and a hissing , without a inhabitant .
they shall roar together like lion : they shall yell as lion ' whelp .
in they heat i will make they feast , and i will make they drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the lord .
i will bring they down like lamb to the slaughter , like ram with he goat .
how be sheshach take ! and how be the praise of the whole earth surprise ! how be babylon become a astonishment among the nation !
the sea be come up upon babylon : she be cover with the multitude of the wave thereof .
she city be a desolation , a dry land , and a wilderness , a land wherein no man dwelleth , neither doth any son of man pass thereby .
and i will punish bel in babylon , and i will bring forth out of he mouth that which he have swallow up : and the nation shall not flow together any more unto he : yea , the wall of babylon shall fall .
my people , go ye out of the midst of she , and deliver ye every man he soul from the fierce anger of the lord .
and lest you heart faint , and ye fear for the rumour that shall be hear in the land ; a rumour shall both come one year , and after that in another year shall come a rumour , and violence in the land , ruler against ruler .
therefore , behold , the day come , that i will do judgment upon the graven image of babylon : and she whole land shall be confound , and all she slay shall fall in the midst of she .
then the heaven and the earth , and all that be therein , shall sing for babylon : for the spoiler shall come unto she from the north , saith the lord .
as babylon have cause the slay of israel to fall , so at babylon shall fall the slay of all the earth .
ye that have escape the sword , go away , stand not still : remember the lord afar off , and let jerusalem come into you mind .
we be confound , because we have hear reproach : shame have cover we face : for stranger be come into the sanctuary of the lord 's house .
wherefore , behold , the day come , saith the lord , that i will do judgment upon she graven image : and through all she land the wounded shall groan .
though babylon should mount up to heaven , and though she should fortify the height of she strength , yet from i shall spoiler come unto she , saith the lord .
a sound of a cry cometh from babylon , and great destruction from the land of the chaldeans :
because the lord have spoil babylon , and destroy out of she the great voice ; when she wave do roar like great water , a noise of they voice be utter :
because the spoiler be come upon she , even upon babylon , and she mighty man be take , every one of they bow be break : for the lord god of recompence shall surely requite .
and i will make drunk she prince , and she wise man , she captain , and she ruler , and she mighty man : and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the king , whose name be the lord of host .
thus saith the lord of host ; the broad wall of babylon shall be utterly break , and she high gate shall be burn with fire ; and the people shall labour in vain , and the folk in the fire , and they shall be weary .
the word which jeremiah the prophet command seraiah the son of neriah , the son of maaseiah , when he go with zedekiah the king of judah into babylon in the fourth year of he reign .
and this seraiah be a quiet prince .
so jeremiah write in a book all the evil that should come upon babylon , even all these word that be write against babylon .
and jeremiah say to seraiah , when thou comest to babylon , and shalt see , and shalt read all these word ;
then shalt thou say , o lord , thou hast speak against this place , to cut it off , that none shall remain in it , neither man nor beast , but that it shall be desolate for ever .
and it shall be , when thou hast make a end of read this book , that thou shalt bind a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of euphrates :
and thou shalt say , thus shall babylon sink , and shall not rise from the evil that i will bring upon she : and they shall be weary .
thus far be the word of jeremiah .
zedekiah be one and twenty year old when he begin to reign , and he reign eleven year in jerusalem .
and he mother 's name be hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah .
and he do that which be evil in the eye of the lord , accord to all that jehoiakim have do .
for through the anger of the lord it come to pass in jerusalem and judah , till he have cast they out from he presence , that zedekiah rebel against the king of babylon .
and it come to pass in the ninth year of he reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon come , he and all he army , against jerusalem , and pitch against it , and build fort against it round about .
so the city be besiege unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah .
and in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine be sore in the city , so that there be no bread for the people of the land .
then the city be break up , and all the man of war flee , and go forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two wall , which be by the king 's garden ; ( now the chaldeans be by the city round about : ) and they go by the way of the plain .
but the army of the chaldeans pursue after the king , and overtake zedekiah in the plain of jericho ; and all he army be scatter from he .
then they take the king , and carry he up unto the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath ; where he give judgment upon he .
and the king of babylon slew the son of zedekiah before he eye : he slew also all the prince of judah in riblah .
then he put out the eye of zedekiah ; and the king of babylon bind he in chain , and carry he to babylon , and put he in prison till the day of he death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which be the nineteenth year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , come nebuzaradan , captain of the guard , which serve the king of babylon , into jerusalem ,
and burn the house of the lord , and the king 's house ; and all the house of jerusalem , and all the house of the great man , burn he with fire :
and all the army of the chaldeans , that be with the captain of the guard , brake down all the wall of jerusalem round about .
then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive certain of the poor of the people , and the residue of the people that remain in the city , and those that fall away , that fall to the king of babylon , and the rest of the multitude .
but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard leave certain of the poor of the land for vinedresser and for husbandman .
also the pillar of brass that be in the house of the lord , and the basis , and the brasen sea that be in the house of the lord , the chaldeans brake , and carry all the brass of they to babylon .
the caldron also , and the shovel , and the snuffer , and the bowl , and the spoon , and all the vessel of brass wherewith they minister , take they away .
and the bason , and the firepan , and the bowl , and the caldron , and the candlestick , and the spoon , and the cup ; that which be of gold in gold , and that which be of silver in silver , take the captain of the guard away .
the two pillar , one sea , and twelve brasen bull that be under the basis , which king solomon have make in the house of the lord : the brass of all these vessel be without weight .
and concern the pillar , the height of one pillar be eighteen cubit ; and a fillet of twelve cubit do compass it ; and the thickness thereof be four finger : it be hollow .
and a chapiter of brass be upon it ; and the height of one chapiter be five cubit , with network and pomegranate upon the chapiter round about , all of brass .
the second pillar also and the pomegranate be like unto these .
and there be ninety and six pomegranate on a side ; and all the pomegranate upon the network be a hundred round about .
and the captain of the guard take seraiah the chief priest , and zephaniah the second priest , and the three keeper of the door :
he take also out of the city a eunuch , which have the charge of the man of war ; and seven man of they that be near the king 's person , which be find in the city ; and the principal scribe of the host , who muster the people of the land ; and threescore man of the people of the land , that be find in the midst of the city .
so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard take they , and bring they to the king of babylon to riblah .
and the king of babylon smite they , and put they to death in riblah in the land of hamath .
thus judah be carry away captive out of he own land .
this be the people whom nebuchadrezzar carry away captive : in the seventh year three thousand jews and three and twenty :
in the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar he carry away captive from jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two person :
in the three and twentieth year of nebuchadrezzar nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive of the jews seven hundred forty and five person : all the person be four thousand and six hundred .
and it come to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah , in the twelfth month , in the five and twentieth day of the month , that evilmerodach king of babylon in the first year of he reign lift up the head of jehoiachin king of judah , and bring he forth out of prison ,
and spake kindly unto he , and set he throne above the throne of the king that be with he in babylon ,
and change he prison garment : and he do continually eat bread before he all the day of he life .
and for he diet , there be a continual diet give he of the king of babylon , every day a portion until the day of he death , all the day of he life .
how doth the city sit solitary , that be full of people ! how be she become as a widow ! she that be great among the nation , and princess among the province , how be she become tributary !
she weepeth sore in the night , and she tear be on she cheek : among all she lover she have none to comfort she : all she friend have deal treacherously with she , they be become she enemy .
judah be go into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude : she dwelleth among the heathen , she findeth no rest : all she persecutor overtake she between the strait .
the way of zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn feast : all she gate be desolate : she priest sigh , she virgin be afflict , and she be in bitterness .
she adversary be the chief , she enemy prosper ; for the lord have afflict she for the multitude of she transgression : she child be go into captivity before the enemy .
and from the daughter of zion all she beauty be depart : she prince be become like hart that find no pasture , and they be go without strength before the pursuer .
jerusalem remember in the day of she affliction and of she misery all she pleasant thing that she have in the day of old , when she people fall into the hand of the enemy , and none do help she : the adversary see she , and do mock at she sabbath .
jerusalem have grievously sin ; therefore she be remove : all that honour she despise she , because they have see she nakedness : yea , she sigheth , and turneth backward .
she filthiness be in she skirt ; she remembereth not she last end ; therefore she come down wonderfully : she have no comforter .
o lord , behold my affliction : for the enemy have magnify himself .
the adversary have spread out he hand upon all she pleasant thing : for she have see that the heathen enter into she sanctuary , whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation .
all she people sigh , they seek bread ; they have give they pleasant thing for meat to relieve the soul : see , o lord , and consider ; for i be become vile .
be it nothing to you , all ye that pass by ? behold , and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow , which be do unto i , wherewith the lord have afflict i in the day of he fierce anger .
from above have he send fire into my bone , and it prevaileth against they : he have spread a net for my foot , he have turn i back : he have make i desolate and faint all the day .
the yoke of my transgression be bind by he hand : they be wreathe , and come up upon my neck : he have make my strength to fall , the lord have deliver i into they hand , from whom i be not able to rise up .
the lord have trodden under foot all my mighty man in the midst of i : he have call a assembly against i to crush my young man : the lord have trodden the virgin , the daughter of judah , as in a winepress .
for these thing i weep ; mine eye , mine eye runneth down with water , because the comforter that should relieve my soul be far from i : my child be desolate , because the enemy prevail .
zion spreadeth forth she hand , and there be none to comfort she : the lord have command concern jacob , that he adversary should be round about he : jerusalem be as a menstruous woman among they .
the lord be righteous ; for i have rebel against he commandment : hear , i pray you , all people , and behold my sorrow : my virgin and my young man be go into captivity .
i call for my lover , but they deceive i : my priest and mine elder give up the ghost in the city , while they seek they meat to relieve they soul .
behold , o lord ; for i be in distress : my bowels be trouble ; mine heart be turn within i ; for i have grievously rebel : abroad the sword bereaveth , at home there be as death .
they have hear that i sigh : there be none to comfort i : all mine enemy have hear of my trouble ; they be glad that thou hast do it : thou wilt bring the day that thou hast call , and they shall be like unto i .
let all they wickedness come before thee ; and do unto they , as thou hast do unto i for all my transgression : for my sigh be many , and my heart be faint .
how have the lord cover the daughter of zion with a cloud in he anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of israel , and remember not he footstool in the day of he anger !
the lord have swallow up all the habitation of jacob , and have not pity : he have throw down in he wrath the strong hold of the daughter of judah ; he have bring they down to the ground : he have polluted the kingdom and the prince thereof .
he have cut off in he fierce anger all the horn of israel : he have draw back he right hand from before the enemy , and he burn against jacob like a flaming fire , which devoureth round about .
he have bent he bow like a enemy : he stand with he right hand as a adversary , and slew all that be pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of zion : he pour out he fury like fire .
the lord be as a enemy : he have swallow up israel , he have swallow up all she palace : he have destroy he strong hold , and have increase in the daughter of judah mourning and lamentation .
and he have violently take away he tabernacle , as if it be of a garden : he have destroy he place of the assembly : the lord have cause the solemn feast and sabbath to be forget in zion , and have despise in the indignation of he anger the king and the priest .
the lord have cast off he altar , he have abhor he sanctuary , he have give up into the hand of the enemy the wall of she palace ; they have make a noise in the house of the lord , as in the day of a solemn feast .
the lord have purpose to destroy the wall of the daughter of zion : he have stretch out a line , he have not withdraw he hand from destroy : therefore he make the rampart and the wall to lament ; they languish together .
she gate be sink into the ground ; he have destroy and break she bar : she king and she prince be among the gentiles : the law be no more ; she prophet also find no vision from the lord .
the elder of the daughter of zion sit upon the ground , and keep silence : they have cast up dust upon they head ; they have gird themselves with sackcloth : the virgin of jerusalem hang down they head to the ground .
mine eye do fail with tear , my bowels be trouble , my liver be pour upon the earth , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the child and the suckling swoon in the street of the city .
they say to they mother , where be corn and wine ? when they swoon as the wound in the street of the city , when they soul be pour out into they mother ' bosom .
what thing shall i take to witness for thee ? what thing shall i liken to thee , o daughter of jerusalem ? what shall i equal to thee , that i may comfort thee , o virgin daughter of zion ? for thy breach be great like the sea : who can heal thee ?
thy prophet have see vain and foolish thing for thee : and they have not discover thine iniquity , to turn away thy captivity ; but have see for thee false burden and cause of banishment .
all that pass by clap they hand at thee ; they hiss and wag they head at the daughter of jerusalem , say , be this the city that man call the perfection of beauty , the joy of the whole earth ?
all thine enemy have open they mouth against thee : they hiss and gnash the tooth : they say , we have swallow she up : certainly this be the day that we look for ; we have find , we have see it .
the lord have do that which he have devise ; he have fulfil he word that he have command in the day of old : he have throw down , and have not pity : and he have cause thine enemy to rejoice over thee , he have set up the horn of thine adversary .
they heart cry unto the lord , o wall of the daughter of zion , let tear run down like a river day and night : give thyself no rest ; let not the apple of thine eye cease .
arise , cry out in the night : in the beginning of the watch pour out thine heart like water before the face of the lord : lift up thy hand toward he for the life of thy young child , that faint for hunger in the top of every street .
behold , o lord , and consider to whom thou hast do this .
shall the woman eat they fruit , and child of a span long ? shall the priest and the prophet be slay in the sanctuary of the lord ?
the young and the old lie on the ground in the street : my virgin and my young man be fall by the sword ; thou hast slay they in the day of thine anger ; thou hast kill , and not pity .
thou hast call as in a solemn day my terror round about , so that in the day of the lord 's anger none escape nor remain : those that i have swaddle and bring up have mine enemy consume .
i be the man that have see affliction by the rod of he wrath .
he have lead i , and bring i into darkness , but not into light .
surely against i be he turn ; he turneth he hand against i all the day .
my flesh and my skin have he make old ; he have broken my bone .
he have build against i , and compass i with gall and travail .
he have set i in dark place , as they that be dead of old .
he have hedge i about , that i can not get out : he have make my chain heavy .
also when i cry and shout , he shutteth out my prayer .
he have inclosed my way with hew stone , he have make my path crooked .
he be unto i as a bear lie in wait , and as a lion in secret place .
he have turn aside my way , and pull i in piece : he have make i desolate .
he have bent he bow , and set i as a mark for the arrow .
he have cause the arrow of he quiver to enter into my rein .
i be a derision to all my people ; and they song all the day .
he have fill i with bitterness , he have make i drunken with wormwood .
he have also break my tooth with gravel stone , he have cover i with ash .
and thou hast remove my soul far off from peace : i forgat prosperity .
and i say , my strength and my hope be perish from the lord :
remember mine affliction and my misery , the wormwood and the gall .
my soul have they still in remembrance , and be humble in i .
this i recall to my mind , therefore have i hope .
it be of the lord 's mercy that we be not consume , because he compassion fail not .
they be new every morning : great be thy faithfulness .
the lord be my portion , saith my soul ; therefore will i hope in he .
the lord be good unto they that wait for he , to the soul that seeketh he .
it be good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the lord .
it be good for a man that he bear the yoke in he youth .
he sitteth alone and keepeth silence , because he have bear it upon he .
he putteth he mouth in the dust ; if so be there may be hope .
he giveth he cheek to he that smiteth he : he be fill full with reproach .
for the lord will not cast off for ever :
but though he cause grief , yet will he have compassion accord to the multitude of he mercy .
for he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the child of man .
to crush under he foot all the prisoner of the earth ,
to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most high ,
to subvert a man in he cause , the lord approveth not .
who be he that saith , and it cometh to pass , when the lord commandeth it not ?
out of the mouth of the most high proceedeth not evil and good ?
wherefore doth a living man complain , a man for the punishment of he sin ?
let we search and try we way , and turn again to the lord .
let we lift up we heart with we hand unto god in the heaven .
we have transgress and have rebel : thou hast not pardon .
thou hast cover with anger , and persecute we : thou hast slay , thou hast not pity .
thou hast cover thyself with a cloud , that we prayer should not pass through .
thou hast make we as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people .
all we enemy have open they mouth against we .
fear and a snare be come upon we , desolation and destruction .
mine eye runneth down with river of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
mine eye trickleth down , and ceaseth not , without any intermission ,
till the lord look down , and behold from heaven .
mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughter of my city .
mine enemy chase i sore , like a bird , without cause .
they have cut off my life in the dungeon , and cast a stone upon i .
waters flow over mine head ; then i say , i be cut off .
i call upon thy name , o lord , out of the low dungeon .
thou hast hear my voice : hide not thine ear at my breathing , at my cry .
thou drewest near in the day that i call upon thee : thou saidst , fear not .
o lord , thou hast plead the cause of my soul ; thou hast redeem my life .
o lord , thou hast see my wrong : judge thou my cause .
thou hast see all they vengeance and all they imagination against i .
thou hast hear they reproach , o lord , and all they imagination against i ;
the lip of those that rise up against i , and they device against i all the day .
behold they sit down , and they rise up ; i be they musick .
render unto they a recompence , o lord , accord to the work of they hand .
give they sorrow of heart , thy curse unto they .
persecute and destroy they in anger from under the heaven of the lord .
how be the gold become dim ! how be the most fine gold change ! the stone of the sanctuary be pour out in the top of every street .
the precious son of zion , comparable to fine gold , how be they esteem as earthen pitcher , the work of the hand of the potter !
even the sea monster draw out the breast , they give suck to they young one : the daughter of my people be become cruel , like the ostrich in the wilderness .
the tongue of the suck child cleaveth to the roof of he mouth for thirst : the young child ask bread , and no man breaketh it unto they .
they that do feed delicately be desolate in the street : they that be bring up in scarlet embrace dunghill .
for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people be greater than the punishment of the sin of sodom , that be overthrow as in a moment , and no hand stay on she .
she nazarite be purer than snow , they be whiter than milk , they be more ruddy in body than ruby , they polishing be of sapphire :
they visage be blacker than a coal ; they be not know in the street : they skin cleaveth to they bone ; it be wither , it be become like a stick .
they that be slay with the sword be better than they that be slay with hunger : for these pine away , stricken through for want of the fruit of the field .
the hand of the pitiful woman have sodden they own child : they be they meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
the lord have accomplish he fury ; he have pour out he fierce anger , and have kindle a fire in zion , and it have devour the foundation thereof .
the king of the earth , and all the inhabitant of the world , would not have believe that the adversary and the enemy should have enter into the gate of jerusalem .
for the sin of she prophet , and the iniquity of she priest , that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of she ,
they have wander as blind man in the street , they have polluted themselves with blood , so that man could not touch they garment .
they cry unto they , depart ye ; it be unclean ; depart , depart , touch not : when they flee away and wander , they say among the heathen , they shall no more sojourn there .
the anger of the lord have divide they ; he will no more regard they : they respect not the person of the priest , they favour not the elder .
as for we , we eye as yet fail for we vain help : in we watch we have watch for a nation that could not save we .
they hunt we step , that we can not go in we street : we end be near , we day be fulfil ; for we end be come .
we persecutor be swifter than the eagle of the heaven : they pursue we upon the mountain , they lay wait for we in the wilderness .
the breath of we nostril , the anointed of the lord , be take in they pit , of whom we say , under he shadow we shall live among the heathen .
rejoice and be glad , o daughter of edom , that dwellest in the land of uz ; the cup also shall pass through unto thee : thou shalt be drunken , and shalt make thyself naked .
the punishment of thine iniquity be accomplish , o daughter of zion ; he will no more carry thee away into captivity : he will visit thine iniquity , o daughter of edom ; he will discover thy sin .
remember , o lord , what be come upon we : consider , and behold we reproach .
we inheritance be turn to stranger , we house to alien .
we be orphan and fatherless , we mother be as widow .
we have drunken we water for money ; we wood be sell unto we .
we neck be under persecution : we labour , and have no rest .
we have give the hand to the egyptians , and to the assyrians , to be satisfy with bread .
we father have sin , and be not ; and we have bear they iniquity .
servant have rule over we : there be none that doth deliver we out of they hand .
we gat we bread with the peril of we life because of the sword of the wilderness .
we skin be black like a oven because of the terrible famine .
they ravish the woman in zion , and the maid in the city of judah .
princes be hang up by they hand : the face of elder be not honour .
they take the young man to grind , and the child fall under the wood .
the elder have cease from the gate , the young man from they musick .
the joy of we heart be cease ; we dance be turn into mourning .
the crown be fall from we head : woe unto we , that we have sin !
for this we heart be faint ; for these thing we eye be dim .
because of the mountain of zion , which be desolate , the fox walk upon it .
thou , o lord , remainest for ever ; thy throne from generation to generation .
wherefore dost thou forget we for ever , and forsake we so long time ?
turn thou we unto thee , o lord , and we shall be turn ; renew we day as of old .
but thou hast utterly reject we ; thou art very wroth against we .
now it come to pass in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth day of the month , as i be among the captive by the river of chebar , that the heaven be open , and i see vision of god .
in the fifth day of the month , which be the fifth year of king jehoiachin 's captivity ,
the word of the lord come expressly unto ezekiel the priest , the son of buzi , in the land of the chaldeans by the river chebar ; and the hand of the lord be there upon he .
and i look , and , behold , a whirlwind come out of the north , a great cloud , and a fire infolding itself , and a brightness be about it , and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber , out of the midst of the fire .
also out of the midst thereof come the likeness of four living creature .
and this be they appearance ; they have the likeness of a man .
and every one have four face , and every one have four wing .
and they foot be straight foot ; and the sole of they foot be like the sole of a calf 's foot : and they sparkle like the colour of burnish brass .
and they have the hand of a man under they wing on they four side ; and they four have they face and they wing .
they wing be join one to another ; they turn not when they go ; they go every one straight forward .
as for the likeness of they face , they four have the face of a man , and the face of a lion , on the right side : and they four have the face of a ox on the left side ; they four also have the face of a eagle .
thus be they face : and they wing be stretch upward ; two wing of every one be join one to another , and two cover they body .
and they go every one straight forward : whither the spirit be to go , they go ; and they turn not when they go .
as for the likeness of the living creature , they appearance be like burn coal of fire , and like the appearance of lamp : it go up and down among the living creature ; and the fire be bright , and out of the fire go forth lightning .
and the living creature run and return as the appearance of a flash of lightning .
now as i behold the living creature , behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creature , with he four face .
the appearance of the wheel and they work be like unto the colour of a beryl : and they four have one likeness : and they appearance and they work be as it be a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
when they go , they go upon they four side : and they turn not when they go .
as for they ring , they be so high that they be dreadful ; and they ring be full of eye round about they four .
and when the living creature go , the wheel go by they : and when the living creature be lift up from the earth , the wheel be lift up .
whithersoever the spirit be to go , they go , thither be they spirit to go ; and the wheel be lift up over against they : for the spirit of the living creature be in the wheel .
when those go , these go ; and when those stand , these stand ; and when those be lift up from the earth , the wheel be lift up over against they : for the spirit of the living creature be in the wheel .
and the likeness of the firmament upon the head of the living creature be as the colour of the terrible crystal , stretch forth over they head above .
and under the firmament be they wing straight , the one toward the other : every one have two , which cover on this side , and every one have two , which cover on that side , they body .
and when they go , i hear the noise of they wing , like the noise of great water , as the voice of the almighty , the voice of speech , as the noise of a host : when they stand , they let down they wing .
and there be a voice from the firmament that be over they head , when they stand , and have let down they wing .
and above the firmament that be over they head be the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone : and upon the likeness of the throne be the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and i see as the colour of amber , as the appearance of fire round about within it , from the appearance of he loin even upward , and from the appearance of he loin even downward , i see as it be the appearance of fire , and it have brightness round about .
as the appearance of the bow that be in the cloud in the day of rain , so be the appearance of the brightness round about .
this be the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord .
and when i see it , i fall upon my face , and i hear a voice of one that speak .
and he say unto i , son of man , stand upon thy foot , and i will speak unto thee .
and the spirit enter into i when he speak unto i , and set i upon my foot , that i hear he that speak unto i .
and he say unto i , son of man , i send thee to the child of israel , to a rebellious nation that have rebel against i : they and they father have transgress against i , even unto this very day .
for they be impudent child and stiffheart .
i do send thee unto they ; and thou shalt say unto they , thus saith the lord god .
and they , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear , ( for they be a rebellious house , ) yet shall know that there have be a prophet among they .
and thou , son of man , be not afraid of they , neither be afraid of they word , though brier and thorn be with thee , and thou dost dwell among scorpion : be not afraid of they word , nor be dismay at they look , though they be a rebellious house .
and thou shalt speak my word unto they , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear : for they be most rebellious .
but thou , son of man , hear what i say unto thee ; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house : open thy mouth , and eat that i give thee .
and when i look , behold , a hand be send unto i ; and , lo , a roll of a book be therein ;
and he spread it before i ; and it be write within and without : and there be write therein lamentation , and mourning , and woe .
moreover he say unto i , son of man , eat that thou findest ; eat this roll , and go speak unto the house of israel .
so i open my mouth , and he cause i to eat that roll .
and he say unto i , son of man , cause thy belly to eat , and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee .
then do i eat it ; and it be in my mouth as honey for sweetness .
and he say unto i , son of man , go , get thee unto the house of israel , and speak with my word unto they .
for thou art not send to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language , but to the house of israel ;
not to many people of a strange speech and of a hard language , whose word thou canst not understand .
surely , have i send thee to they , they would have hearken unto thee .
but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee ; for they will not hearken unto i : for all the house of israel be impudent and hardhearted .
behold , i have make thy face strong against they face , and thy forehead strong against they forehead .
as a adamant harder than flint have i make thy forehead : fear they not , neither be dismay at they look , though they be a rebellious house .
moreover he say unto i , son of man , all my word that i shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart , and hear with thine ear .
and go , get thee to they of the captivity , unto the child of thy people , and speak unto they , and tell they , thus saith the lord god ; whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear .
then the spirit take i up , and i hear behind i a voice of a great rush , say , bless be the glory of the lord from he place .
i hear also the noise of the wing of the living creature that touch one another , and the noise of the wheel over against they , and a noise of a great rush .
so the spirit lift i up , and take i away , and i go in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the lord be strong upon i .
then i come to they of the captivity at telabib , that dwelt by the river of chebar , and i sit where they sit , and remain there astonish among they seven day .
and it come to pass at the end of seven day , that the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , i have make thee a watchman unto the house of israel : therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give they warn from i .
when i say unto the wicked , thou shalt surely die ; and thou givest he not warn , nor speakest to warn the wicked from he wicked way , to save he life ; the same wicked man shall die in he iniquity ; but he blood will i require at thine hand .
yet if thou warn the wicked , and he turn not from he wickedness , nor from he wicked way , he shall die in he iniquity ; but thou hast deliver thy soul .
again , when a righteous man doth turn from he righteousness , and commit iniquity , and i lay a stumbling-block before he , he shall die : because thou hast not give he warn , he shall die in he sin , and he righteousness which he have do shall not be remember ; but he blood will i require at thine hand .
nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man , that the righteous sin not , and he doth not sin , he shall surely live , because he be warn ; also thou hast deliver thy soul .
and the hand of the lord be there upon i ; and he say unto i , arise , go forth into the plain , and i will there talk with thee .
then i arise , and go forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the lord stand there , as the glory which i see by the river of chebar : and i fall on my face .
then the spirit enter into i , and set i upon my foot , and spake with i , and say unto i , go , shut thyself within thine house .
but thou , o son of man , behold , they shall put band upon thee , and shall bind thee with they , and thou shalt not go out among they :
and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to they a reprover : for they be a rebellious house .
but when i speak with thee , i will open thy mouth , and thou shalt say unto they , thus saith the lord god ; he that heareth , let he hear ; and he that forbeareth , let he forbear : for they be a rebellious house .
thou also , son of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and pourtray upon it the city , even jerusalem :
and lay siege against it , and build a fort against it , and cast a mount against it ; set the camp also against it , and set batter ram against it round about .
moreover take thou unto thee a iron pan , and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city : and set thy face against it , and it shall be besiege , and thou shalt lay siege against it .
this shall be a sign to the house of israel .
lie thou also upon thy leave side , and lay the iniquity of the house of israel upon it : accord to the number of the day that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear they iniquity .
for i have lay upon thee the year of they iniquity , accord to the number of the day , three hundred and ninety day : so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel .
and when thou hast accomplish they , lie again on thy right side , and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty day : i have appoint thee each day for a year .
therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem , and thine arm shall be uncover , and thou shalt prophesy against it .
and , behold , i will lay band upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast end the day of thy siege .
take thou also unto thee wheat , and barley , and bean , and lentile , and millet , and fitch , and put they in one vessel , and make thee bread thereof , accord to the number of the day that thou shalt lie upon thy side , three hundred and ninety day shalt thou eat thereof .
and thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight , twenty shekel a day : from time to time shalt thou eat it .
thou shalt drink also water by measure , the sixth part of a hin : from time to time shalt thou drink .
and thou shalt eat it as barley cake , and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man , in they sight .
and the lord say , even thus shall the child of israel eat they defiled bread among the gentiles , whither i will drive they .
then say i , ah lord god ! behold , my soul have not be polluted : for from my youth up even till now have i not eat of that which dieth of itself , or be tear in piece ; neither come there abominable flesh into my mouth .
then he say unto i , lo , i have give thee cow 's dung for man 's dung , and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith .
moreover he say unto i , son of man , behold , i will break the staff of bread in jerusalem : and they shall eat bread by weight , and with care ; and they shall drink water by measure , and with astonishment :
that they may want bread and water , and be astony one with another , and consume away for they iniquity .
and thou , son of man , take thee a sharp knife , take thee a barber 's razor , and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard : then take thee balance to weigh , and divide the hair .
thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city , when the day of the siege be fulfil : and thou shalt take a third part , and smite about it with a knife : and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind ; and i will draw out a sword after they .
thou shalt also take thereof a few in number , and bind they in thy skirt .
then take of they again , and cast they into the midst of the fire , and burn they in the fire ; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of israel .
thus saith the lord god ; this be jerusalem : i have set it in the midst of the nation and country that be round about she .
and she have change my judgment into wickedness more than the nation , and my statute more than the country that be round about she : for they have refuse my judgment and my statute , they have not walk in they .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because ye multiply more than the nation that be round about you , and have not walk in my statute , neither have keep my judgment , neither have do accord to the judgment of the nation that be round about you ;
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i , even i , be against thee , and will execute judgment in the midst of thee in the sight of the nation .
and i will do in thee that which i have not do , and whereunto i will not do any more the like , because of all thine abomination .
therefore the father shall eat the son in the midst of thee , and the son shall eat they father ; and i will execute judgment in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter into all the wind .
wherefore , as i live , saith the lord god ; surely , because thou hast defile my sanctuary with all thy detestable thing , and with all thine abomination , therefore will i also diminish thee ; neither shall mine eye spare , neither will i have any pity .
a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence , and with famine shall they be consume in the midst of thee : and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee ; and i will scatter a third part into all the wind , and i will draw out a sword after they .
thus shall mine anger be accomplish , and i will cause my fury to rest upon they , and i will be comfort : and they shall know that i the lord have speak it in my zeal , when i have accomplish my fury in they .
moreover i will make thee waste , and a reproach among the nation that be round about thee , in the sight of all that pass by .
so it shall be a reproach and a taunt , a instruction and a astonishment unto the nation that be round about thee , when i shall execute judgment in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebuke .
i the lord have speak it .
when i shall send upon they the evil arrow of famine , which shall be for they destruction , and which i will send to destroy you : and i will increase the famine upon you , and will break you staff of bread :
so will i send upon you famine and evil beast , and they shall bereave thee ; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee ; and i will bring the sword upon thee .
i the lord have speak it .
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , set thy face toward the mountain of israel , and prophesy against they ,
and say , ye mountain of israel , hear the word of the lord god ; thus saith the lord god to the mountain , and to the hill , to the river , and to the valley ; behold , i , even i , will bring a sword upon you , and i will destroy you high place .
and you altar shall be desolate , and you image shall be break : and i will cast down you slay man before you idol .
and i will lay the dead carcase of the child of israel before they idol ; and i will scatter you bone round about you altar .
in all you dwellingplace the city shall be lay waste , and the high place shall be desolate ; that you altar may be lay waste and make desolate , and you idol may be break and cease , and you image may be cut down , and you work may be abolish .
and the slay shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall know that i be the lord .
yet will i leave a remnant , that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nation , when ye shall be scatter through the country .
and they that escape of you shall remember i among the nation whither they shall be carry captive , because i be break with they whorish heart , which have depart from i , and with they eye , which go a whoring after they idol : and they shall lothe themselves for the evil which they have commit in all they abomination .
and they shall know that i be the lord , and that i have not say in vain that i would do this evil unto they .
thus saith the lord god ; smite with thine hand , and stamp with thy foot , and say , alas for all the evil abomination of the house of israel ! for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence .
he that be far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that be near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remaineth and be besiege shall die by the famine : thus will i accomplish my fury upon they .
then shall ye know that i be the lord , when they slay man shall be among they idol round about they altar , upon every high hill , in all the top of the mountain , and under every green tree , and under every thick oak , the place where they do offer sweet savour to all they idol .
so will i stretch out my hand upon they , and make the land desolate , yea , more desolate than the wilderness toward diblath , in all they habitation : and they shall know that i be the lord .
moreover the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
also , thou son of man , thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel ; a end , the end be come upon the four corner of the land .
now be the end come upon thee , and i will send mine anger upon thee , and will judge thee accord to thy way , and will recompense upon thee all thine abomination .
and mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will i have pity : but i will recompense thy way upon thee , and thine abomination shall be in the midst of thee : and ye shall know that i be the lord .
thus saith the lord god ; a evil , a only evil , behold , be come .
a end be come , the end be come : it watcheth for thee ; behold , it be come .
the morning be come unto thee , o thou that dwellest in the land : the time be come , the day of trouble be near , and not the sound again of the mountain .
now will i shortly pour out my fury upon thee , and accomplish mine anger upon thee : and i will judge thee accord to thy way , and will recompense thee for all thine abomination .
and mine eye shall not spare , neither will i have pity : i will recompense thee accord to thy way and thine abomination that be in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that i be the lord that smiteth .
behold the day , behold , it be come : the morning be go forth ; the rod have blossom , pride have bud .
violence be rise up into a rod of wickedness : none of they shall remain , nor of they multitude , nor of any of theirs : neither shall there be wail for they .
the time be come , the day draweth near : let not the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn : for wrath be upon all the multitude thereof .
for the seller shall not return to that which be sell , although they be yet alive : for the vision be touch the whole multitude thereof , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of he life .
they have blow the trumpet , even to make all ready ; but none goeth to the battle : for my wrath be upon all the multitude thereof .
the sword be without , and the pestilence and the famine within : he that be in the field shall die with the sword ; and he that be in the city , famine and pestilence shall devour he .
but they that escape of they shall escape , and shall be on the mountain like dove of the valley , all of they mourn , every one for he iniquity .
all hand shall be feeble , and all knee shall be weak as water .
they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth , and horror shall cover they ; and shame shall be upon all face , and baldness upon all they head .
they shall cast they silver in the street , and they gold shall be remove : they silver and they gold shall not be able to deliver they in the day of the wrath of the lord : they shall not satisfy they soul , neither fill they bowels : because it be the stumblingblock of they iniquity .
as for the beauty of he ornament , he set it in majesty : but they make the image of they abomination and of they detestable thing therein : therefore have i set it far from they .
and i will give it into the hand of the stranger for a prey , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil ; and they shall pollute it .
my face will i turn also from they , and they shall pollute my secret place : for the robber shall enter into it , and defile it .
make a chain : for the land be full of bloody crime , and the city be full of violence .
wherefore i will bring the worst of the heathen , and they shall possess they house : i will also make the pomp of the strong to cease ; and they holy place shall be defile .
destruction cometh ; and they shall seek peace , and there shall be none .
mischief shall come upon mischief , and rumour shall be upon rumour ; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the ancient .
the king shall mourn , and the prince shall be clothe with desolation , and the hand of the people of the land shall be trouble : i will do unto they after they way , and accord to they desert will i judge they ; and they shall know that i be the lord .
and it come to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as i sit in mine house , and the elder of judah sit before i , that the hand of the lord god fall there upon i .
then i behold , and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of he loin even downward , fire ; and from he loin even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the colour of amber .
and he put forth the form of a hand , and take i by a lock of mine head ; and the spirit lift i up between the earth and the heaven , and bring i in the vision of god to jerusalem , to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north ; where be the seat of the image of jealousy , which provoketh to jealousy .
and , behold , the glory of the god of israel be there , accord to the vision that i see in the plain .
then say he unto i , son of man , lift up thine eye now the way toward the north .
so i lift up mine eye the way toward the north , and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
he say furthermore unto i , son of man , seest thou what they do ? even the great abomination that the house of israel committeth here , that i should go far off from my sanctuary ? but turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abomination .
and he bring i to the door of the court ; and when i look , behold a hole in the wall .
then say he unto i , son of man , dig now in the wall : and when i have dig in the wall , behold a door .
and he say unto i , go in , and behold the wicked abomination that they do here .
so i go in and see ; and behold every form of creep thing , and abominable beast , and all the idol of the house of israel , pourtray upon the wall round about .
and there stand before they seventy man of the ancient of the house of israel , and in the midst of they stand jaazaniah the son of shaphan , with every man he censer in he hand ; and a thick cloud of incense go up .
then say he unto i , son of man , hast thou see what the ancient of the house of israel do in the dark , every man in the chamber of he imagery ? for they say , the lord seeth we not ; the lord have forsake the earth .
he say also unto i , turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abomination that they do .
then he bring i to the door of the gate of the lord 's house which be toward the north ; and , behold , there sit woman weep for tammuz .
then say he unto i , hast thou see this , o son of man ? turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abomination than these .
and he bring i into the inner court of the lord 's house , and , behold , at the door of the temple of the lord , between the porch and the altar , be about five and twenty man , with they back toward the temple of the lord , and they face toward the east ; and they worship the sun toward the east .
then he say unto i , hast thou see this , o son of man ?
be it a light thing to the house of judah that they commit the abomination which they commit here ? for they have fill the land with violence , and have return to provoke i to anger : and , lo , they put the branch to they nose .
therefore will i also deal in fury : mine eye shall not spare , neither will i have pity : and though they cry in mine ear with a loud voice , yet will i not hear they .
he cry also in mine ear with a loud voice , say , cause they that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with he destroy weapon in he hand .
and , behold , six man come from the way of the higher gate , which lieth toward the north , and every man a slaughter weapon in he hand ; and one man among they be clothe with linen , with a writer 's inkhorn by he side : and they go in , and stand beside the brasen altar .
and the glory of the god of israel be go up from the cherub , whereupon he be , to the threshold of the house .
and he call to the man clothe with linen , which have the writer 's inkhorn by he side ;
and the lord say unto he , go through the midst of the city , through the midst of jerusalem , and set a mark upon the forehead of the man that sigh and that cry for all the abomination that be do in the midst thereof .
and to the other he say in mine hearing , go ye after he through the city , and smite : let not you eye spare , neither have ye pity :
slay utterly old and young , both maid , and little child , and woman : but come not near any man upon whom be the mark ; and begin at my sanctuary .
then they begin at the ancient man which be before the house .
and he say unto they , defile the house , and fill the court with the slay : go ye forth .
and they go forth , and slew in the city .
and it come to pass , while they be slaying they , and i be leave , that i fall upon my face , and cry , and say , ah lord god ! wilt thou destroy all the residue of israel in thy pour out of thy fury upon jerusalem ?
then say he unto i , the iniquity of the house of israel and judah be exceed great , and the land be full of blood , and the city full of perverseness : for they say , the lord have forsake the earth , and the lord seeth not .
and as for i also , mine eye shall not spare , neither will i have pity , but i will recompense they way upon they head .
and , behold , the man clothe with linen , which have the inkhorn by he side , report the matter , say , i have do as thou hast command i .
then i look , and , behold , in the firmament that be above the head of the cherubim there appear over they as it be a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
and he speak unto the man clothe with linen , and say , go in between the wheel , even under the cherub , and fill thine hand with coal of fire from between the cherubim , and scatter they over the city .
and he go in in my sight .
now the cherubim stand on the right side of the house , when the man go in ; and the cloud fill the inner court .
then the glory of the lord go up from the cherub , and stand over the threshold of the house ; and the house be fill with the cloud , and the court be full of the brightness of the lord 's glory .
and the sound of the cherubim ' wing be hear even to the outer court , as the voice of the almighty god when he speaketh .
and it come to pass , that when he have command the man clothe with linen , say , take fire from between the wheel , from between the cherubim ; then he go in , and stand beside the wheel .
and one cherub stretch forth he hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that be between the cherubim , and take thereof , and put it into the hand of he that be clothe with linen : who take it , and go out .
and there appear in the cherubim the form of a man 's hand under they wing .
and when i look , behold the four wheel by the cherubim , one wheel by one cherub , and another wheel by another cherub : and the appearance of the wheel be as the colour of a beryl stone .
and as for they appearance , they four have one likeness , as if a wheel have be in the midst of a wheel .
when they go , they go upon they four side ; they turn not as they go , but to the place whither the head look they follow it ; they turn not as they go .
and they whole body , and they back , and they hand , and they wing , and the wheel , be full of eye round about , even the wheel that they four have .
as for the wheel , it be cry unto they in my hearing , o wheel .
and every one have four face : the first face be the face of a cherub , and the second face be the face of a man , and the third the face of a lion , and the fourth the face of a eagle .
and the cherubim be lift up .
this be the living creature that i see by the river of chebar .
and when the cherubim go , the wheel go by they : and when the cherubim lift up they wing to mount up from the earth , the same wheel also turn not from beside they .
when they stand , these stand ; and when they be lift up , these lift up themselves also : for the spirit of the living creature be in they .
then the glory of the lord depart from off the threshold of the house , and stand over the cherubim .
and the cherubim lift up they wing , and mount up from the earth in my sight : when they go out , the wheel also be beside they , and every one stand at the door of the east gate of the lord 's house ; and the glory of the god of israel be over they above .
this be the living creature that i see under the god of israel by the river of chebar ; and i know that they be the cherubim .
every one have four face apiece , and every one four wing ; and the likeness of the hand of a man be under they wing .
and the likeness of they face be the same face which i see by the river of chebar , they appearance and themselves : they go every one straight forward .
moreover the spirit lift i up , and bring i unto the east gate of the lord 's house , which looketh eastward : and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty man ; among whom i see jaazaniah the son of azur , and pelatiah the son of benaiah , prince of the people .
then say he unto i , son of man , these be the man that devise mischief , and give wicked counsel in this city :
which say , it be not near ; let we build house : this city be the caldron , and we be the flesh .
therefore prophesy against they , prophesy , o son of man .
and the spirit of the lord fall upon i , and say unto i , speak ; thus saith the lord ; thus have ye say , o house of israel : for i know the thing that come into you mind , every one of they .
ye have multiply you slay in this city , and ye have fill the street thereof with the slay .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; you slay whom ye have lay in the midst of it , they be the flesh , and this city be the caldron : but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
ye have fear the sword ; and i will bring a sword upon you , saith the lord god .
and i will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hand of stranger , and will execute judgment among you .
ye shall fall by the sword ; i will judge you in the border of israel ; and ye shall know that i be the lord .
this city shall not be you caldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof ; but i will judge you in the border of israel :
and ye shall know that i be the lord : for ye have not walk in my statute , neither execute my judgment , but have do after the manners of the heathen that be round about you .
and it come to pass , when i prophesy , that pelatiah the son of benaiah die .
then fall i down upon my face , and cry with a loud voice , and say , ah lord god ! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of israel ?
again the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , thy brethren , even thy brethren , the man of thy kindred , and all the house of israel wholly , be they unto whom the inhabitant of jerusalem have say , get you far from the lord : unto we be this land give in possession .
therefore say , thus saith the lord god ; although i have cast they far off among the heathen , and although i have scatter they among the country , yet will i be to they as a little sanctuary in the country where they shall come .
therefore say , thus saith the lord god ; i will even gather you from the people , and assemble you out of the country where ye have be scatter , and i will give you the land of israel .
and they shall come thither , and they shall take away all the detestable thing thereof and all the abomination thereof from thence .
and i will give they one heart , and i will put a new spirit within you ; and i will take the stony heart out of they flesh , and will give they a heart of flesh :
that they may walk in my statute , and keep mine ordinance , and do they : and they shall be my people , and i will be they god .
but as for they whose heart walketh after the heart of they detestable thing and they abomination , i will recompense they way upon they own head , saith the lord god .
then do the cherubim lift up they wing , and the wheel beside they ; and the glory of the god of israel be over they above .
and the glory of the lord go up from the midst of the city , and stand upon the mountain which be on the east side of the city .
afterwards the spirit take i up , and bring i in a vision by the spirit of god into chaldea , to they of the captivity .
so the vision that i have see go up from i .
then i speak unto they of the captivity all the thing that the lord have shew i .
the word of the lord also come unto i , say ,
son of man , thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house , which have eye to see , and see not ; they have ear to hear , and hear not : for they be a rebellious house .
therefore , thou son of man , prepare thee stuff for remove , and remove by day in they sight ; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in they sight : it may be they will consider , though they be a rebellious house .
then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in they sight , as stuff for remove : and thou shalt go forth at even in they sight , as they that go forth into captivity .
dig thou through the wall in they sight , and carry out thereby .
in they sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder , and carry it forth in the twilight : thou shalt cover thy face , that thou see not the ground : for i have set thee for a sign unto the house of israel .
and i do so as i be command : i bring forth my stuff by day , as stuff for captivity , and in the even i dig through the wall with mine hand ; i bring it forth in the twilight , and i bare it upon my shoulder in they sight .
and in the morning come the word of the lord unto i , say ,
son of man , have not the house of israel , the rebellious house , say unto thee , what doest thou ?
say thou unto they , thus saith the lord god ; this burden concerneth the prince in jerusalem , and all the house of israel that be among they .
say , i be you sign : like as i have do , so shall it be do unto they : they shall remove and go into captivity .
and the prince that be among they shall bear upon he shoulder in the twilight , and shall go forth : they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby : he shall cover he face , that he see not the ground with he eye .
my net also will i spread upon he , and he shall be take in my snare : and i will bring he to babylon to the land of the chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
and i will scatter toward every wind all that be about he to help he , and all he band ; and i will draw out the sword after they .
and they shall know that i be the lord , when i shall scatter they among the nation , and disperse they in the country .
but i will leave a few man of they from the sword , from the famine , and from the pestilence ; that they may declare all they abomination among the heathen whither they come ; and they shall know that i be the lord .
moreover the word of the lord come to i , say ,
son of man , eat thy bread with quake , and drink thy water with tremble and with carefulness ;
and say unto the people of the land , thus saith the lord god of the inhabitant of jerusalem , and of the land of israel ; they shall eat they bread with carefulness , and drink they water with astonishment , that she land may be desolate from all that be therein , because of the violence of all they that dwell therein .
and the city that be inhabit shall be lay waste , and the land shall be desolate ; and ye shall know that i be the lord .
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , what be that proverb that ye have in the land of israel , say , the day be prolonged , and every vision faileth ?
tell they therefore , thus saith the lord god ; i will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel ; but say unto they , the day be at hand , and the effect of every vision .
for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of israel .
for i be the lord : i will speak , and the word that i shall speak shall come to pass ; it shall be no more prolonged : for in you day , o rebellious house , will i say the word , and will perform it , saith the lord god .
again the word of the lord come to i , say ,
son of man , behold , they of the house of israel say , the vision that he seeth be for many day to come , and he prophesieth of the time that be far off .
therefore say unto they , thus saith the lord god ; there shall none of my word be prolong any more , but the word which i have speak shall be do , saith the lord god .
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , prophesy against the prophet of israel that prophesy , and say thou unto they that prophesy out of they own heart , hear ye the word of the lord ;
thus saith the lord god ; woe unto the foolish prophet , that follow they own spirit , and have see nothing !
o israel , thy prophet be like the fox in the desert .
ye have not go up into the gap , neither make up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord .
they have see vanity and lie divination , say , the lord saith : and the lord have not send they : and they have make other to hope that they would confirm the word .
have ye not see a vain vision , and have ye not speak a lie divination , whereas ye say , the lord saith it ; albeit i have not speak ?
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because ye have speak vanity , and see lie , therefore , behold , i be against you , saith the lord god .
and mine hand shall be upon the prophet that see vanity , and that divine lie : they shall not be in the assembly of my people , neither shall they be write in the writing of the house of israel , neither shall they enter into the land of israel ; and ye shall know that i be the lord god .
because , even because they have seduce my people , say , peace ; and there be no peace ; and one build up a wall , and , lo , other daub it with untempered morter :
say unto they which daub it with untempered morter , that it shall fall : there shall be a overflow shower ; and ye , o great hailstone , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall rend it .
lo , when the wall be fall , shall it not be say unto you , where be the daub wherewith ye have daub it ?
therefore thus saith the lord god ; i will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury ; and there shall be a overflow shower in mine anger , and great hailstone in my fury to consume it .
so will i break down the wall that ye have daub with untempered morter , and bring it down to the ground , so that the foundation thereof shall be discover , and it shall fall , and ye shall be consume in the midst thereof : and ye shall know that i be the lord .
thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall , and upon they that have daub it with untempered morter , and will say unto you , the wall be no more , neither they that daub it ;
to wit , the prophet of israel which prophesy concern jerusalem , and which see vision of peace for she , and there be no peace , saith the lord god .
likewise , thou son of man , set thy face against the daughter of thy people , which prophesy out of they own heart ; and prophesy thou against they ,
and say , thus saith the lord god ; woe to the woman that sew pillow to all armhole , and make kerchief upon the head of every stature to hunt soul !
will ye hunt the soul of my people , and will ye save the soul alive that come unto you ?
and will ye pollute i among my people for handful of barley and for piece of bread , to slay the soul that should not die , and to save the soul alive that should not live , by you lie to my people that hear you lie ?
wherefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i be against you pillow , wherewith ye there hunt the soul to make they fly , and i will tear they from you arm , and will let the soul go , even the soul that ye hunt to make they fly .
you kerchief also will i tear , and deliver my people out of you hand , and they shall be no more in you hand to be hunt ; and ye shall know that i be the lord .
because with lie ye have make the heart of the righteous sad , whom i have not make sad ; and strengthen the hand of the wicked , that he should not return from he wicked way , by promise he life :
therefore ye shall see no more vanity , nor divine divination : for i will deliver my people out of you hand : and ye shall know that i be the lord .
then come certain of the elder of israel unto i , and sit before i .
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , these man have set up they idol in they heart , and put the stumblingblock of they iniquity before they face : should i be enquire of at all by they ?
therefore speak unto they , and say unto they , thus saith the lord god ; every man of the house of israel that setteth up he idol in he heart , and putteth the stumblingblock of he iniquity before he face , and cometh to the prophet ; i the lord will answer he that cometh accord to the multitude of he idol ;
that i may take the house of israel in they own heart , because they be all estrange from i through they idol .
therefore say unto the house of israel , thus saith the lord god ; repent , and turn yourselve from you idol ; and turn away you face from all you abomination .
for every one of the house of israel , or of the stranger that sojourneth in israel , which separateth himself from i , and setteth up he idol in he heart , and putteth the stumblingblock of he iniquity before he face , and cometh to a prophet to enquire of he concern i ; i the lord will answer he by myself :
and i will set my face against that man , and will make he a sign and a proverb , and i will cut he off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that i be the lord .
and if the prophet be deceive when he have speak a thing , i the lord have deceive that prophet , and i will stretch out my hand upon he , and will destroy he from the midst of my people israel .
and they shall bear the punishment of they iniquity : the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of he that seeketh unto he ;
that the house of israel may go no more astray from i , neither be polluted any more with all they transgression ; but that they may be my people , and i may be they god , saith the lord god .
the word of the lord come again to i , say ,
son of man , when the land sinneth against i by trespassing grievously , then will i stretch out mine hand upon it , and will break the staff of the bread thereof , and will send famine upon it , and will cut off man and beast from it :
though these three man , noah , daniel , and job , be in it , they should deliver but they own soul by they righteousness , saith the lord god .
if i cause noisome beast to pass through the land , and they spoil it , so that it be desolate , that no man may pass through because of the beast :
though these three man be in it , as i live , saith the lord god , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter ; they only shall be deliver , but the land shall be desolate .
or if i bring a sword upon that land , and say , sword , go through the land ; so that i cut off man and beast from it :
though these three man be in it , as i live , saith the lord god , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter , but they only shall be deliver themselves .
or if i send a pestilence into that land , and pour out my fury upon it in blood , to cut off from it man and beast :
though noah , daniel , and job , be in it , as i live , saith the lord god , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter ; they shall but deliver they own soul by they righteousness .
for thus saith the lord god ; how much more when i send my four sore judgment upon jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the noisome beast , and the pestilence , to cut off from it man and beast ?
yet , behold , therein shall be leave a remnant that shall be bring forth , both son and daughter : behold , they shall come forth unto you , and ye shall see they way and they doings : and ye shall be comfort concern the evil that i have bring upon jerusalem , even concern all that i have bring upon it .
and they shall comfort you , when ye see they way and they doings : and ye shall know that i have not do without cause all that i have do in it , saith the lord god .
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , what be the vine tree more than any tree , or than a branch which be among the tree of the forest ?
shall wood be take thereof to do any work ? or will man take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon ?
behold , it be cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire devoureth both the end of it , and the midst of it be burn .
be it meet for any work ?
behold , when it be whole , it be meet for no work : how much less shall it be meet yet for any work , when the fire have devour it , and it be burn ?
therefore thus saith the lord god ; as the vine tree among the tree of the forest , which i have give to the fire for fuel , so will i give the inhabitant of jerusalem .
and i will set my face against they ; they shall go out from one fire , and another fire shall devour they ; and ye shall know that i be the lord , when i set my face against they .
and i will make the land desolate , because they have commit a trespass , saith the lord god .
again the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , cause jerusalem to know she abomination ,
and say , thus saith the lord god unto jerusalem ; thy birth and thy nativity be of the land of canaan ; thy father be a amorite , and thy mother a hittite .
and as for thy nativity , in the day thou wast bear thy navel be not cut , neither wast thou wash in water to supple thee ; thou wast not salt at all , nor swaddle at all .
none eye pity thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the lothing of thy person , in the day that thou wast bear .
and when i pass by thee , and see thee polluted in thine own blood , i say unto thee when thou wast in thy blood , live ; yea , i say unto thee when thou wast in thy blood , live .
i have cause thee to multiply as the bud of the field , and thou hast increase and waxen great , and thou art come to excellent ornament : thy breast be fashion , and thine hair be grow , whereas thou wast naked and bare .
now when i pass by thee , and look upon thee , behold , thy time be the time of love ; and i spread my skirt over thee , and cover thy nakedness : yea , i sware unto thee , and enter into a covenant with thee , saith the lord god , and thou becamest mine .
then wash i thee with water ; yea , i throughly wash away thy blood from thee , and i anoint thee with oil .
i clothe thee also with broidered work , and shoe thee with badger ' skin , and i gird thee about with fine linen , and i cover thee with silk .
i deck thee also with ornament , and i put bracelet upon thy hand , and a chain on thy neck .
and i put a jewel on thy forehead , and earring in thine ear , and a beautiful crown upon thine head .
thus wast thou deck with gold and silver ; and thy raiment be of fine linen , and silk , and broidered work ; thou didst eat fine flour , and honey , and oil : and thou wast exceed beautiful , and thou didst prosper into a kingdom .
and thy renown go forth among the heathen for thy beauty : for it be perfect through my comeliness , which i have put upon thee , saith the lord god .
but thou didst trust in thine own beauty , and playedst the harlot because of thy renown , and pouredst out thy fornication on every one that pass by ; he it be .
and of thy garment thou didst take , and deckedst thy high place with diver colour , and playedst the harlot thereupon : the like thing shall not come , neither shall it be so .
thou hast also take thy fair jewel of my gold and of my silver , which i have give thee , and madest to thyself image of man , and didst commit whoredom with they ,
and tookest thy broidered garment , and coveredst they : and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before they .
my meat also which i give thee , fine flour , and oil , and honey , wherewith i feed thee , thou hast even set it before they for a sweet savour : and thus it be , saith the lord god .
moreover thou hast take thy son and thy daughter , whom thou hast bear unto i , and these hast thou sacrifice unto they to be devour .
be this of thy whoredom a small matter ,
that thou hast slay my child , and deliver they to cause they to pass through the fire for they ?
and in all thine abomination and thy whoredom thou hast not remember the day of thy youth , when thou wast naked and bare , and wast polluted in thy blood .
and it come to pass after all thy wickedness , ( woe , woe unto thee ! saith the lord god ; )
that thou hast also build unto thee a eminent place , and hast make thee a high place in every street .
thou hast build thy high place at every head of the way , and hast make thy beauty to be abhor , and hast open thy foot to every one that pass by , and multiply thy whoredom .
thou hast also commit fornication with the egyptians thy neighbour , great of flesh ; and hast increase thy whoredom , to provoke i to anger .
behold , therefore i have stretch out my hand over thee , and have diminish thine ordinary food , and deliver thee unto the will of they that hate thee , the daughter of the philistines , which be ashamed of thy lewd way .
thou hast play the whore also with the assyrians , because thou wast unsatiable ; yea , thou hast play the harlot with they , and yet couldest not be satisfy .
thou hast moreover multiply thy fornication in the land of canaan unto chaldea ; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith .
how weak be thine heart , saith the lord god , see thou doest all these thing , the work of a imperious whorish woman ;
in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way , and makest thine high place in every street ; and hast not be as a harlot , in that thou scornest hire ;
but as a wife that committeth adultery , which taketh stranger instead of she husband !
they give gift to all whore : but thou givest thy gift to all thy lover , and hirest they , that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom .
and the contrary be in thee from other woman in thy whoredom , whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredom : and in that thou givest a reward , and no reward be give unto thee , therefore thou art contrary .
wherefore , o harlot , hear the word of the lord :
thus saith the lord god ; because thy filthiness be pour out , and thy nakedness discover through thy whoredom with thy lover , and with all the idol of thy abomination , and by the blood of thy child , which thou didst give unto they ;
behold , therefore i will gather all thy lover , with whom thou hast take pleasure , and all they that thou hast loved , with all they that thou hast hate ; i will even gather they round about against thee , and will discover thy nakedness unto they , that they may see all thy nakedness .
and i will judge thee , as woman that break wedlock and shed blood be judge ; and i will give thee blood in fury and jealousy .
and i will also give thee into they hand , and they shall throw down thine eminent place , and shall break down thy high place : they shall strip thee also of thy clothes , and shall take thy fair jewel , and leave thee naked and bare .
they shall also bring up a company against thee , and they shall stone thee with stone , and thrust thee through with they sword .
and they shall burn thine house with fire , and execute judgment upon thee in the sight of many woman : and i will cause thee to cease from play the harlot , and thou also shalt give no hire any more .
so will i make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and i will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
because thou hast not remember the day of thy youth , but hast fret i in all these thing ; behold , therefore i also will recompense thy way upon thine head , saith the lord god : and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abomination .
behold , every one that useth proverb shall use this proverb against thee , say , as be the mother , so be she daughter .
thou art thy mother 's daughter , that lotheth she husband and she child ; and thou art the sister of thy sister , which lothe they husband and they child : you mother be a hittite , and you father a amorite .
and thine elder sister be samaria , she and she daughter that dwell at thy leave hand : and thy younger sister , that dwelleth at thy right hand , be sodom and she daughter .
yet hast thou not walk after they way , nor do after they abomination : but , as if that be a very little thing , thou wast corrupt more than they in all thy way .
as i live , saith the lord god , sodom thy sister have not do , she nor she daughter , as thou hast do , thou and thy daughter .
behold , this be the iniquity of thy sister sodom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of idleness be in she and in she daughter , neither do she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
and they be haughty , and committed abomination before i : therefore i take they away as i see good .
neither have samaria commit half of thy sin ; but thou hast multiply thine abomination more than they , and hast justified thy sister in all thine abomination which thou hast do .
thou also , which hast judge thy sister , bear thine own shame for thy sin that thou hast commit more abominable than they : they be more righteous than thou : yea , be thou confound also , and bear thy shame , in that thou hast justified thy sister .
when i shall bring again they captivity , the captivity of sodom and she daughter , and the captivity of samaria and she daughter , then will i bring again the captivity of thy captive in the midst of they :
that thou mayest bear thine own shame , and mayest be confound in all that thou hast do , in that thou art a comfort unto they .
when thy sister , sodom and she daughter , shall return to they former estate , and samaria and she daughter shall return to they former estate , then thou and thy daughter shall return to you former estate .
for thy sister sodom be not mention by thy mouth in the day of thy pride ,
before thy wickedness be discover , as at the time of thy reproach of the daughter of syria , and all that be round about she , the daughter of the philistines , which despise thee round about .
thou hast bear thy lewdness and thine abomination , saith the lord .
for thus saith the lord god ; i will even deal with thee as thou hast do , which hast despise the oath in break the covenant .
nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the day of thy youth , and i will establish unto thee a everlasting covenant .
then thou shalt remember thy way , and be ashamed , when thou shalt receive thy sister , thine elder and thy younger : and i will give they unto thee for daughter , but not by thy covenant .
and i will establish my covenant with thee ; and thou shalt know that i be the lord :
that thou mayest remember , and be confound , and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame , when i be pacify toward thee for all that thou hast do , saith the lord god .
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , put forth a riddle , and speak a parable unto the house of israel ;
and say , thus saith the lord god ; a great eagle with great wing , longwinge , full of feather , which have diver colour , come unto lebanon , and take the highest branch of the cedar :
he crop off the top of he young twig , and carry it into a land of traffick ; he set it in a city of merchant .
he take also of the seed of the land , and plant it in a fruitful field ; he place it by great water , and set it as a willow tree .
and it grow , and become a spreading vine of low stature , whose branch turn toward he , and the root thereof be under he : so it become a vine , and bring forth branch , and shoot forth sprig .
there be also another great eagle with great wing and many feather : and , behold , this vine do bend she root toward he , and shot forth she branch toward he , that he might water it by the furrow of she plantation .
it be plant in a good soil by great water , that it might bring forth branch , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
say thou , thus saith the lord god ; shall it prosper ? shall he not pull up the root thereof , and cut off the fruit thereof , that it wither ? it shall wither in all the leaf of she spring , even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the root thereof .
yea , behold , be plant , shall it prosper ? shall it not utterly wither , when the east wind toucheth it ? it shall wither in the furrow where it grow .
moreover the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
say now to the rebellious house , know ye not what these thing mean ? tell they , behold , the king of babylon be come to jerusalem , and have take the king thereof , and the prince thereof , and lead they with he to babylon ;
and have take of the king 's seed , and make a covenant with he , and have take a oath of he : he have also take the mighty of the land :
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keep of he covenant it might stand .
but he rebel against he in send he ambassador into egypt , that they might give he horse and much people .
shall he prosper ? shall he escape that doeth such thing ? or shall he break the covenant , and be deliver ?
as i live , saith the lord god , surely in the place where the king dwelleth that make he king , whose oath he despise , and whose covenant he brake , even with he in the midst of babylon he shall die .
neither shall pharaoh with he mighty army and great company make for he in the war , by cast up mount , and building fort , to cut off many person :
see he despise the oath by break the covenant , when , lo , he have give he hand , and have do all these thing , he shall not escape .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; as i live , surely mine oath that he have despise , and my covenant that he have break , even it will i recompense upon he own head .
and i will spread my net upon he , and he shall be take in my snare , and i will bring he to babylon , and will plead with he there for he trespass that he have trespass against i .
and all he fugitive with all he band shall fall by the sword , and they that remain shall be scatter toward all wind : and ye shall know that i the lord have speak it .
thus saith the lord god ; i will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar , and will set it ; i will crop off from the top of he young twig a tender one , and will plant it upon a high mountain and eminent :
in the mountain of the height of israel will i plant it : and it shall bring forth bough , and bear fruit , and be a goodly cedar : and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing ; in the shadow of the branch thereof shall they dwell .
and all the tree of the field shall know that i the lord have bring down the high tree , have exalt the low tree , have dry up the green tree , and have make the dry tree to flourish : i the lord have speak and have do it .
the word of the lord come unto i again , say ,
what mean ye , that ye use this proverb concern the land of israel , say , the father have eat sour grape , and the child 's tooth be set on edge ?
as i live , saith the lord god , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel .
behold , all soul be mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son be mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die .
but if a man be just , and do that which be lawful and right ,
and have not eat upon the mountain , neither have lift up he eye to the idol of the house of israel , neither have defile he neighbour 's wife , neither have come near to a menstruous woman ,
and have not oppress any , but have restore to the debtor he pledge , have spoil none by violence , have give he bread to the hungry , and have cover the naked with a garment ;
he that have not give forth upon usury , neither have take any increase , that have withdraw he hand from iniquity , have execute true judgment between man and man ,
hath walk in my statute , and have keep my judgment , to deal truly ; he be just , he shall surely live , saith the lord god .
if he beget a son that be a robber , a shedder of blood , and that doeth the like to any one of these thing ,
and that doeth not any of those duty , but even have eat upon the mountain , and defile he neighbour 's wife ,
hath oppress the poor and needy , have spoil by violence , have not restore the pledge , and have lift up he eye to the idol , have committed abomination ,
hath give forth upon usury , and have take increase : shall he then live ? he shall not live : he have do all these abomination ; he shall surely die ; he blood shall be upon he .
now , lo , if he beget a son , that seeth all he father 's sin which he have do , and considereth , and doeth not such like ,
that have not eat upon the mountain , neither have lift up he eye to the idol of the house of israel , have not defile he neighbour 's wife ,
neither have oppress any , have not withholden the pledge , neither have spoil by violence , but have give he bread to the hungry , and have cover the naked with a garment ,
that have take off he hand from the poor , that have not receive usury nor increase , have execute my judgment , have walk in my statute ; he shall not die for the iniquity of he father , he shall surely live .
as for he father , because he cruelly oppress , spoil he brother by violence , and do that which be not good among he people , lo , even he shall die in he iniquity .
yet say ye , why ? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father ?
when the son have do that which be lawful and right , and have keep all my statute , and have do they , he shall surely live .
the soul that sinneth , it shall die .
the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father , neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son : the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon he , and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon he .
but if the wicked will turn from all he sin that he have commit , and keep all my statute , and do that which be lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
all he transgression that he have commit , they shall not be mention unto he : in he righteousness that he have do he shall live .
have i any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? saith the lord god : and not that he should return from he way , and live ?
but when the righteous turneth away from he righteousness , and committeth iniquity , and doeth accord to all the abomination that the wicked man doeth , shall he live ?
all he righteousness that he have do shall not be mention : in he trespass that he have trespass , and in he sin that he have sin , in they shall he die .
yet ye say , the way of the lord be not equal .
hear now , o house of israel ; be not my way equal ? be not you way unequal ?
when a righteous man turneth away from he righteousness , and committeth iniquity , and dieth in they ; for he iniquity that he have do shall he die .
again , when the wicked man turneth away from he wickedness that he have commit , and doeth that which be lawful and right , he shall save he soul alive .
because he considereth , and turneth away from all he transgression that he have commit , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
yet saith the house of israel , the way of the lord be not equal .
o house of israel , be not my way equal ? be not you way unequal ?
therefore i will judge you , o house of israel , every one accord to he way , saith the lord god .
repent , and turn yourselve from all you transgression ; so iniquity shall not be you ruin .
cast away from you all you transgression , whereby ye have transgress ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , o house of israel ?
for i have no pleasure in the death of he that dieth , saith the lord god : wherefore turn yourselve , and live ye .
moreover take thou up a lamentation for the prince of israel ,
and say , what be thy mother ?
a lioness : she lay down among lion , she nourish she whelp among young lion .
and she bring up one of she whelp : it become a young lion , and it learn to catch the prey ; it devour man .
the nation also hear of he ; he be take in they pit , and they bring he with chain unto the land of egypt .
now when she see that she have wait , and she hope be lose , then she take another of she whelp , and make he a young lion .
and he go up and down among the lion , he become a young lion , and learn to catch the prey , and devour man .
and he know they desolate palace , and he lay waste they city ; and the land be desolate , and the fulness thereof , by the noise of he roaring .
then the nation set against he on every side from the province , and spread they net over he : he be take in they pit .
and they put he in ward in chain , and bring he to the king of babylon : they bring he into hold , that he voice should no more be hear upon the mountain of israel .
thy mother be like a vine in thy blood , plant by the water : she be fruitful and full of branch by reason of many water .
and she have strong rod for the sceptre of they that bare rule , and she stature be exalt among the thick branch , and she appear in she height with the multitude of she branch .
but she be pluck up in fury , she be cast down to the ground , and the east wind dry up she fruit : she strong rod be break and wither ; the fire consume they .
and now she be plant in the wilderness , in a dry and thirsty ground .
and fire be go out of a rod of she branch , which have devour she fruit , so that she have no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule .
this be a lamentation , and shall be for a lamentation .
and it come to pass in the seventh year , in the fifth month , the tenth day of the month , that certain of the elder of israel come to enquire of the lord , and sit before i .
then come the word of the lord unto i , say ,
son of man , speak unto the elder of israel , and say unto they , thus saith the lord god ; be ye come to enquire of i ?
as i live , saith the lord god , i will not be enquire of by you .
wilt thou judge they , son of man , wilt thou judge they ? cause they to know the abomination of they father :
and say unto they , thus saith the lord god ; in the day when i choose israel , and lift up mine hand unto the seed of the house of jacob , and make myself known unto they in the land of egypt , when i lift up mine hand unto they , say , i be the lord you god ;
in the day that i lift up mine hand unto they , to bring they forth of the land of egypt into a land that i have espy for they , flow with milk and honey , which be the glory of all land :
then say i unto they , cast ye away every man the abomination of he eye , and defile not yourselve with the idol of egypt : i be the lord you god .
but they rebel against i , and would not hearken unto i : they do not every man cast away the abomination of they eye , neither do they forsake the idol of egypt : then i say , i will pour out my fury upon they , to accomplish my anger against they in the midst of the land of egypt .
but i work for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , among whom they be , in whose sight i make myself known unto they , in bring they forth out of the land of egypt .
wherefore i cause they to go forth out of the land of egypt , and bring they into the wilderness .
and i give they my statute , and shew they my judgment , which if a man do , he shall even live in they .
moreover also i give they my sabbath , to be a sign between i and they , that they might know that i be the lord that sanctify they .
but the house of israel rebel against i in the wilderness : they walk not in my statute , and they despise my judgment , which if a man do , he shall even live in they ; and my sabbath they greatly polluted : then i say , i would pour out my fury upon they in the wilderness , to consume they .
but i work for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , in whose sight i bring they out .
yet also i lift up my hand unto they in the wilderness , that i would not bring they into the land which i have give they , flow with milk and honey , which be the glory of all land ;
because they despise my judgment , and walk not in my statute , but polluted my sabbath : for they heart go after they idol .
nevertheless mine eye spare they from destroy they , neither do i make a end of they in the wilderness .
but i say unto they child in the wilderness , walk ye not in the statute of you father , neither observe they judgment , nor defile yourselve with they idol :
i be the lord you god ; walk in my statute , and keep my judgment , and do they ;
and hallow my sabbath ; and they shall be a sign between i and you , that ye may know that i be the lord you god .
notwithstanding the child rebel against i : they walk not in my statute , neither keep my judgment to do they , which if a man do , he shall even live in they ; they polluted my sabbath : then i say , i would pour out my fury upon they , to accomplish my anger against they in the wilderness .
nevertheless i withdraw mine hand , and work for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen , in whose sight i bring they forth .
i lift up mine hand unto they also in the wilderness , that i would scatter they among the heathen , and disperse they through the country ;
because they have not execute my judgment , but have despise my statute , and have polluted my sabbath , and they eye be after they father ' idol .
wherefore i give they also statute that be not good , and judgment whereby they should not live ;
and i polluted they in they own gift , in that they cause to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb , that i might make they desolate , to the end that they might know that i be the lord .
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of israel , and say unto they , thus saith the lord god ; yet in this you father have blaspheme i , in that they have commit a trespass against i .
for when i have bring they into the land , for the which i lift up mine hand to give it to they , then they see every high hill , and all the thick tree , and they offer there they sacrifice , and there they present the provocation of they offering : there also they make they sweet savour , and pour out there they drink offering .
then i say unto they , what be the high place whereunto ye go ?
and the name thereof be call bamah unto this day .
wherefore say unto the house of israel , thus saith the lord god ; be ye polluted after the manner of you father ? and commit ye whoredom after they abomination ?
for when ye offer you gift , when ye make you son to pass through the fire , ye pollute yourselve with all you idol , even unto this day : and shall i be enquire of by you , o house of israel ?
as i live , saith the lord god , i will not be enquire of by you .
and that which cometh into you mind shall not be at all , that ye say , we will be as the heathen , as the family of the country , to serve wood and stone .
as i live , saith the lord god , surely with a mighty hand , and with a stretch out arm , and with fury pour out , will i rule over you :
and i will bring you out from the people , and will gather you out of the country wherein ye be scatter , with a mighty hand , and with a stretch out arm , and with fury pour out .
and i will bring you into the wilderness of the people , and there will i plead with you face to face .
like as i plead with you father in the wilderness of the land of egypt , so will i plead with you , saith the lord god .
and i will cause you to pass under the rod , and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant :
and i will purge out from among you the rebel , and they that transgress against i : i will bring they forth out of the country where they sojourn , and they shall not enter into the land of israel : and ye shall know that i be the lord .
as for you , o house of israel , thus saith the lord god ; go ye , serve ye every one he idol , and hereafter also , if ye will not hearken unto i : but pollute ye my holy name no more with you gift , and with you idol .
for in mine holy mountain , in the mountain of the height of israel , saith the lord god , there shall all the house of israel , all of they in the land , serve i : there will i accept they , and there will i require you offering , and the firstfruit of you oblation , with all you holy thing .
i will accept you with you sweet savour , when i bring you out from the people , and gather you out of the country wherein ye have be scatter ; and i will be sanctify in you before the heathen .
and ye shall know that i be the lord , when i shall bring you into the land of israel , into the country for the which i lift up mine hand to give it to you father .
and there shall ye remember you way , and all you doings , wherein ye have be defile ; and ye shall lothe yourselve in you own sight for all you evil that ye have commit .
and ye shall know that i be the lord , when i have work with you for my name 's sake , not accord to you wicked way , nor accord to you corrupt doings , o ye house of israel , saith the lord god .
moreover the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , set thy face toward the south , and drop thy word toward the south , and prophesy against the forest of the south field ;
and say to the forest of the south , hear the word of the lord ; thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will kindle a fire in thee , and it shall devour every green tree in thee , and every dry tree : the flaming flame shall not be quench , and all face from the south to the north shall be burn therein .
and all flesh shall see that i the lord have kindle it : it shall not be quench .
then say i , ah lord god ! they say of i , doth he not speak parable ?
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , set thy face toward jerusalem , and drop thy word toward the holy place , and prophesy against the land of israel ,
and say to the land of israel , thus saith the lord ; behold , i be against thee , and will draw forth my sword out of he sheath , and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
see then that i will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of he sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
that all flesh may know that i the lord have draw forth my sword out of he sheath : it shall not return any more .
sigh therefore , thou son of man , with the breaking of thy loin ; and with bitterness sigh before they eye .
and it shall be , when they say unto thee , wherefore sighest thou ? that thou shalt answer , for the tiding ; because it cometh : and every heart shall melt , and all hand shall be feeble , and every spirit shall faint , and all knee shall be weak as water : behold , it cometh , and shall be bring to pass , saith the lord god .
again the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , prophesy , and say , thus saith the lord ; say , a sword , a sword be sharpen , and also furbish :
it be sharpen to make a sore slaughter ; it be furbish that it may glitter : should we then make mirth ? it contemneth the rod of my son , as every tree .
and he have give it to be furbish , that it may be handle : this sword be sharpen , and it be furbish , to give it into the hand of the slayer .
cry and howl , son of man : for it shall be upon my people , it shall be upon all the prince of israel : terror by reason of the sword shall be upon my people : smite therefore upon thy thigh .
because it be a trial , and what if the sword contemn even the rod ? it shall be no more , saith the lord god .
thou therefore , son of man , prophesy , and smite thine hand together , and let the sword be double the third time , the sword of the slay : it be the sword of the great man that be slay , which entereth into they privy chamber .
i have set the point of the sword against all they gate , that they heart may faint , and they ruin be multiply : ah ! it be make bright , it be wrap up for the slaughter .
go thee one way or other , either on the right hand , or on the left , whithersoever thy face be set .
i will also smite mine hand together , and i will cause my fury to rest : i the lord have say it .
the word of the lord come unto i again , say ,
also , thou son of man , appoint thee two way , that the sword of the king of babylon may come : both twain shall come forth out of one land : and choose thou a place , choose it at the head of the way to the city .
appoint a way , that the sword may come to rabbath of the ammonites , and to judah in jerusalem the defence .
for the king of babylon stand at the parting of the way , at the head of the two way , to use divination : he make he arrow bright , he consult with image , he look in the liver .
at he right hand be the divination for jerusalem , to appoint captain , to open the mouth in the slaughter , to lift up the voice with shout , to appoint batter ram against the gate , to cast a mount , and to build a fort .
and it shall be unto they as a false divination in they sight , to they that have swear oath : but he will call to remembrance the iniquity , that they may be take .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because ye have make you iniquity to be remember , in that you transgression be discover , so that in all you doings you sin do appear ; because , i say , that ye be come to remembrance , ye shall be take with the hand .
and thou , profane wicked prince of israel , whose day be come , when iniquity shall have a end ,
thus saith the lord god ; remove the diadem , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : exalt he that be low , and abase he that be high .
i will overturn , overturn , overturn , it : and it shall be no more , until he come whose right it be ; and i will give it he .
and thou , son of man , prophesy and say , thus saith the lord god concern the ammonites , and concern they reproach ; even say thou , the sword , the sword be draw : for the slaughter it be furbish , to consume because of the glittering :
whiles they see vanity unto thee , while they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the neck of they that be slay , of the wicked , whose day be come , when they iniquity shall have a end .
shall i cause it to return into he sheath ?
i will judge thee in the place where thou wast create , in the land of thy nativity .
and i will pour out mine indignation upon thee , i will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish man , and skilful to destroy .
thou shalt be for fuel to the fire ; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land ; thou shalt be no more remembered : for i the lord have speak it .
moreover the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
now , thou son of man , wilt thou judge , wilt thou judge the bloody city ? yea , thou shalt shew she all she abomination .
then say thou , thus saith the lord god , the city sheddeth blood in the midst of it , that she time may come , and maketh idol against herself to defile herself .
thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed ; and hast defile thyself in thine idol which thou hast make ; and thou hast cause thy day to draw near , and art come even unto thy year : therefore have i make thee a reproach unto the heathen , and a mock to all country .
those that be near , and those that be far from thee , shall mock thee , which art infamous and much vex .
behold , the prince of israel , every one be in thee to they power to shed blood .
in thee have they set light by father and mother : in the midst of thee have they deal by oppression with the stranger : in thee have they vex the fatherless and the widow .
thou hast despise mine holy thing , and hast profane my sabbath .
in thee be man that carry tale to shed blood : and in thee they eat upon the mountain : in the midst of thee they commit lewdness .
in thee have they discover they father ' nakedness : in thee have they humble she that be set apart for pollution .
and one have committed abomination with he neighbour 's wife ; and another have lewdly defile he daughter in law ; and another in thee have humble he sister , he father 's daughter .
in thee have they take gift to shed blood ; thou hast take usury and increase , and thou hast greedily gain of thy neighbour by extortion , and hast forget i , saith the lord god .
behold , therefore i have smite mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast make , and at thy blood which have be in the midst of thee .
can thine heart endure , or can thine hand be strong , in the day that i shall deal with thee ?
i the lord have speak it , and will do it .
and i will scatter thee among the heathen , and disperse thee in the country , and will consume thy filthiness out of thee .
and thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen , and thou shalt know that i be the lord .
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , the house of israel be to i become dross : all they be brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they be even the dross of silver .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because ye be all become dross , behold , therefore i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem .
as they gather silver , and brass , and iron , and lead , and tin , into the midst of the furnace , to blow the fire upon it , to melt it ; so will i gather you in mine anger and in my fury , and i will leave you there , and melt you .
yea , i will gather you , and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath , and ye shall be melt in the midst thereof .
as silver be melt in the midst of the furnace , so shall ye be melt in the midst thereof ; and ye shall know that i the lord have pour out my fury upon you .
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , say unto she , thou art the land that be not cleansed , nor rain upon in the day of indignation .
there be a conspiracy of she prophet in the midst thereof , like a roar lion raven the prey ; they have devour soul ; they have take the treasure and precious thing ; they have make she many widow in the midst thereof .
she priest have violate my law , and have profane mine holy thing : they have put no difference between the holy and profane , neither have they shew difference between the unclean and the clean , and have hide they eye from my sabbath , and i be profane among they .
she prince in the midst thereof be like wolf raven the prey , to shed blood , and to destroy soul , to get dishonest gain .
and she prophet have daub they with untempered morter , see vanity , and divine lie unto they , say , thus saith the lord god , when the lord have not speak .
the people of the land have use oppression , and exercise robbery , and have vex the poor and needy : yea , they have oppress the stranger wrongfully .
and i seek for a man among they , that should make up the hedge , and stand in the gap before i for the land , that i should not destroy it : but i find none .
therefore have i pour out mine indignation upon they ; i have consume they with the fire of my wrath : they own way have i recompense upon they head , saith the lord god .
the word of the lord come again unto i , say ,
son of man , there be two woman , the daughter of one mother :
and they commit whoredom in egypt ; they commit whoredom in they youth : there be they breast press , and there they bruise the teat of they virginity .
and the name of they be aholah the elder , and aholibah she sister : and they be mine , and they bare son and daughter .
thus be they name ; samaria be aholah , and jerusalem aholibah .
and aholah play the harlot when she be mine ; and she dote on she lover , on the assyrians she neighbour ,
which be clothe with blue , captain and ruler , all of they desirable young man , horseman ride upon horse .
thus she commit she whoredom with they , with all they that be the choose man of assyria , and with all on whom she dote : with all they idol she defile herself .
neither leave she she whoredom bring from egypt : for in she youth they lay with she , and they bruise the breast of she virginity , and pour they whoredom upon she .
wherefore i have deliver she into the hand of she lover , into the hand of the assyrians , upon whom she dote .
these discover she nakedness : they take she son and she daughter , and slew she with the sword : and she become famous among woman ; for they have execute judgment upon she .
and when she sister aholibah see this , she be more corrupt in she inordinate love than she , and in she whoredom more than she sister in she whoredom .
she dote upon the assyrians she neighbour , captain and ruler clothe most gorgeously , horseman ride upon horse , all of they desirable young man .
then i see that she be defile , that they take both one way ,
and that she increase she whoredom : for when she see man pourtray upon the wall , the image of the chaldeans pourtray with vermilion ,
gird with girdle upon they loin , exceed in dye attire upon they head , all of they prince to look to , after the manner of the babylonians of chaldea , the land of they nativity :
and as soon as she see they with she eye , she dote upon they , and send messenger unto they into chaldea .
and the babylonians come to she into the bed of love , and they defile she with they whoredom , and she be polluted with they , and she mind be alienate from they .
so she discover she whoredom , and discover she nakedness : then my mind be alienate from she , like as my mind be alienate from she sister .
yet she multiply she whoredom , in call to remembrance the day of she youth , wherein she have play the harlot in the land of egypt .
for she dote upon they paramour , whose flesh be as the flesh of ass , and whose issue be like the issue of horse .
thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth , in bruise thy teat by the egyptians for the pap of thy youth .
therefore , o aholibah , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will raise up thy lover against thee , from whom thy mind be alienate , and i will bring they against thee on every side ;
the babylonians , and all the chaldeans , pekod , and shoa , and koa , and all the assyrians with they : all of they desirable young man , captain and ruler , great lord and renowned , all of they ride upon horse .
and they shall come against thee with chariot , wagon , and wheel , and with a assembly of people , which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about : and i will set judgment before they , and they shall judge thee accord to they judgment .
and i will set my jealousy against thee , and they shall deal furiously with thee : they shall take away thy nose and thine ear ; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword : they shall take thy son and thy daughter ; and thy residue shall be devour by the fire .
they shall also strip thee out of thy clothes , and take away thy fair jewel .
thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee , and thy whoredom bring from the land of egypt : so that thou shalt not lift up thine eye unto they , nor remember egypt any more .
for thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will deliver thee into the hand of they whom thou hatest , into the hand of they from whom thy mind be alienate :
and they shall deal with thee hatefully , and shall take away all thy labour , and shall leave thee naked and bare : and the nakedness of thy whoredom shall be discover , both thy lewdness and thy whoredom .
i will do these thing unto thee , because thou hast go a whoring after the heathen , and because thou art polluted with they idol .
thou hast walk in the way of thy sister ; therefore will i give she cup into thine hand .
thus saith the lord god ; thou shalt drink of thy sister 's cup deep and large : thou shalt be laugh to scorn and have in derision ; it containeth much .
thou shalt be fill with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of thy sister samaria .
thou shalt even drink it and suck it out , and thou shalt break the sherd thereof , and pluck off thine own breast : for i have speak it , saith the lord god .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because thou hast forget i , and cast i behind thy back , therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredom .
the lord say moreover unto i ; son of man , wilt thou judge aholah and aholibah ? yea , declare unto they they abomination ;
that they have commit adultery , and blood be in they hand , and with they idol have they commit adultery , and have also cause they son , whom they bare unto i , to pass for they through the fire , to devour they .
moreover this they have do unto i : they have defile my sanctuary in the same day , and have profane my sabbath .
for when they have slay they child to they idol , then they come the same day into my sanctuary to profane it ; and , lo , thus have they do in the midst of mine house .
and furthermore , that ye have send for man to come from far , unto whom a messenger be send ; and , lo , they come : for whom thou didst wash thyself , paintedst thy eye , and deckedst thyself with ornament ,
and satest upon a stately bed , and a table prepare before it , whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil .
and a voice of a multitude be at ease be with she : and with the man of the common sort be bring sabeans from the wilderness , which put bracelet upon they hand , and beautiful crown upon they head .
then say i unto she that be old in adultery , will they now commit whoredom with she , and she with they ?
yet they go in unto she , as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot : so go they in unto aholah and unto aholibah , the lewd woman .
and the righteous man , they shall judge they after the manner of adulteress , and after the manner of woman that shed blood ; because they be adulteress , and blood be in they hand .
for thus saith the lord god ; i will bring up a company upon they , and will give they to be remove and spoil .
and the company shall stone they with stone , and dispatch they with they sword ; they shall slay they son and they daughter , and burn up they house with fire .
thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land , that all woman may be teach not to do after you lewdness .
and they shall recompense you lewdness upon you , and ye shall bear the sin of you idol : and ye shall know that i be the lord god .
again in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , write thee the name of the day , even of this same day : the king of babylon set himself against jerusalem this same day .
and utter a parable unto the rebellious house , and say unto they , thus saith the lord god ; set on a pot , set it on , and also pour water into it :
gather the piece thereof into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bone .
take the choice of the flock , and burn also the bone under it , and make it boil well , and let they seethe the bone of it therein .
wherefore thus saith the lord god ; woe to the bloody city , to the pot whose scum be therein , and whose scum be not go out of it ! bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall upon it .
for she blood be in the midst of she ; she set it upon the top of a rock ; she pour it not upon the ground , to cover it with dust ;
that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance ; i have set she blood upon the top of a rock , that it should not be cover .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; woe to the bloody city !
i will even make the pile for fire great .
heap on wood , kindle the fire , consume the flesh , and spice it well , and let the bone be burn .
then set it empty upon the coal thereof , that the brass of it may be hot , and may burn , and that the filthiness of it may be melt in it , that the scum of it may be consume .
she have wearied herself with lie , and she great scum go not forth out of she : she scum shall be in the fire .
in thy filthiness be lewdness : because i have purge thee , and thou wast not purge , thou shalt not be purge from thy filthiness any more , till i have cause my fury to rest upon thee .
i the lord have speak it : it shall come to pass , and i will do it ; i will not go back , neither will i spare , neither will i repent ; accord to thy way , and accord to thy doings , shall they judge thee , saith the lord god .
also the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , behold , i take away from thee the desire of thine eye with a stroke : yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep , neither shall thy tear run down .
forbear to cry , make no mourning for the dead , bind the tire of thine head upon thee , and put on thy shoe upon thy foot , and cover not thy lip , and eat not the bread of man .
so i speak unto the people in the morning : and at even my wife die ; and i do in the morning as i be command .
and the people say unto i , wilt thou not tell we what these thing be to we , that thou doest so ?
then i answer they , the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
speak unto the house of israel , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will profane my sanctuary , the excellency of you strength , the desire of you eye , and that which you soul pitieth ; and you son and you daughter whom ye have leave shall fall by the sword .
and ye shall do as i have do : ye shall not cover you lip , nor eat the bread of man .
and you tire shall be upon you head , and you shoe upon you foot : ye shall not mourn nor weep ; but ye shall pine away for you iniquity , and mourn one toward another .
thus ezekiel be unto you a sign : accord to all that he have do shall ye do : and when this cometh , ye shall know that i be the lord god .
also , thou son of man , shall it not be in the day when i take from they they strength , the joy of they glory , the desire of they eye , and that whereupon they set they mind , they son and they daughter ,
that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee , to cause thee to hear it with thine ear ?
in that day shall thy mouth be open to he which be escape , and thou shalt speak , and be no more dumb : and thou shalt be a sign unto they ; and they shall know that i be the lord .
the word of the lord come again unto i , say ,
son of man , set thy face against the ammonites , and prophesy against they ;
and say unto the ammonites , hear the word of the lord god ; thus saith the lord god ; because thou saidst , aha , against my sanctuary , when it be profane ; and against the land of israel , when it be desolate ; and against the house of judah , when they go into captivity ;
behold , therefore i will deliver thee to the man of the east for a possession , and they shall set they palace in thee , and make they dwelling in thee : they shall eat thy fruit , and they shall drink thy milk .
and i will make rabbah a stable for camel , and the ammonites a couch place for flock : and ye shall know that i be the lord .
for thus saith the lord god ; because thou hast clap thine hand , and stamp with the foot , and rejoice in heart with all thy despite against the land of israel ;
behold , therefore i will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen ; and i will cut thee off from the people , and i will cause thee to perish out of the country : i will destroy thee ; and thou shalt know that i be the lord .
thus saith the lord god ; because that moab and seir do say , behold , the house of judah be like unto all the heathen ;
therefore , behold , i will open the side of moab from the city , from he city which be on he frontier , the glory of the country , bethjeshimoth , baalmeon , and kiriathaim ,
unto the man of the east with the ammonites , and will give they in possession , that the ammonites may not be remember among the nation .
and i will execute judgment upon moab ; and they shall know that i be the lord .
thus saith the lord god ; because that edom have deal against the house of judah by take vengeance , and have greatly offend , and revenge himself upon they ;
therefore thus saith the lord god ; i will also stretch out mine hand upon edom , and will cut off man and beast from it ; and i will make it desolate from teman ; and they of dedan shall fall by the sword .
and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people israel : and they shall do in edom accord to mine anger and accord to my fury ; and they shall know my vengeance , saith the lord god .
thus saith the lord god ; because the philistines have deal by revenge , and have take vengeance with a despiteful heart , to destroy it for the old hatred ;
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will stretch out mine hand upon the philistines , and i will cut off the cherethims , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast .
and i will execute great vengeance upon they with furious rebuke ; and they shall know that i be the lord , when i shall lay my vengeance upon they .
and it come to pass in the eleventh year , in the first day of the month , that the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , because that tyrus have say against jerusalem , aha , she be break that be the gate of the people : she be turn unto i : i shall be replenish , now she be lay waste :
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i be against thee , o tyrus , and will cause many nation to come up against thee , as the sea causeth he wave to come up .
and they shall destroy the wall of tyrus , and break down she tower : i will also scrape she dust from she , and make she like the top of a rock .
it shall be a place for the spreading of net in the midst of the sea : for i have speak it , saith the lord god : and it shall become a spoil to the nation .
and she daughter which be in the field shall be slay by the sword ; and they shall know that i be the lord .
for thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will bring upon tyrus nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , a king of king , from the north , with horse , and with chariot , and with horseman , and company , and much people .
he shall slay with the sword thy daughter in the field : and he shall make a fort against thee , and cast a mount against thee , and lift up the buckler against thee .
and he shall set engine of war against thy wall , and with he axis he shall break down thy tower .
by reason of the abundance of he horse they dust shall cover thee : thy wall shall shake at the noise of the horseman , and of the wheel , and of the chariot , when he shall enter into thy gate , as man enter into a city wherein be make a breach .
with the hoof of he horse shall he tread down all thy street : he shall slay thy people by the sword , and thy strong garrison shall go down to the ground .
and they shall make a spoil of thy riches , and make a prey of thy merchandise : and they shall break down thy wall , and destroy thy pleasant house : and they shall lay thy stone and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water .
and i will cause the noise of thy song to cease ; and the sound of thy harp shall be no more hear .
and i will make thee like the top of a rock : thou shalt be a place to spread net upon ; thou shalt be build no more : for i the lord have speak it , saith the lord god .
thus saith the lord god to tyrus ; shall not the isle shake at the sound of thy fall , when the wounded cry , when the slaughter be make in the midst of thee ?
then all the prince of the sea shall come down from they throne , and lay away they robe , and put off they broidered garment : they shall clothe themselves with tremble ; they shall sit upon the ground , and shall tremble at every moment , and be astonish at thee .
and they shall take up a lamentation for thee , and say to thee , how art thou destroy , that wast inhabit of seafaring man , the renowned city , which be strong in the sea , she and she inhabitant , which cause they terror to be on all that haunt it !
now shall the isle tremble in the day of thy fall ; yea , the isle that be in the sea shall be trouble at thy departure .
for thus saith the lord god ; when i shall make thee a desolate city , like the city that be not inhabit ; when i shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great water shall cover thee ;
when i shall bring thee down with they that descend into the pit , with the people of old time , and shall set thee in the low part of the earth , in place desolate of old , with they that go down to the pit , that thou be not inhabit ; and i shall set glory in the land of the living ;
i will make thee a terror , and thou shalt be no more : though thou be seek for , yet shalt thou never be find again , saith the lord god .

and all that handle the oar , the mariner , and all the pilot of the sea , shall come down from they ship , they shall stand upon the land ;
and shall cause they voice to be hear against thee , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust upon they head , they shall wallow themselves in the ash :

all the inhabitant of the isle shall be astonish at thee , and they king shall be sore afraid , they shall be trouble in they countenance .
the merchant among the people shall hiss at thee ; thou shalt be a terror , and never shalt be any more .
the word of the lord come again unto i , say ,
son of man , say unto the prince of tyrus , thus saith the lord god ; because thine heart be lift up , and thou hast say , i be a god , i sit in the seat of god , in the midst of the sea ; yet thou art a man , and not god , though thou set thine heart as the heart of god :
behold , thou art wiser than daniel ; there be no secret that they can hide from thee :
with thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast get thee riches , and hast get gold and silver into thy treasure :
by thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increase thy riches , and thine heart be lift up because of thy riches :
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of god ;
behold , therefore i will bring stranger upon thee , the terrible of the nation : and they shall draw they sword against the beauty of thy wisdom , and they shall defile thy brightness .
they shall bring thee down to the pit , and thou shalt die the death of they that be slay in the midst of the sea .
wilt thou yet say before he that slayeth thee , i be god ? but thou shalt be a man , and no god , in the hand of he that slayeth thee .
thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of stranger : for i have speak it , saith the lord god .
moreover the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus , and say unto he , thus saith the lord god ; thou sealest up the sum , full of wisdom , and perfect in beauty .
thou hast be in eden the garden of god ; every precious stone be thy cover , the sardius , topaz , and the diamond , the beryl , the onyx , and the jasper , the sapphire , the emerald , and the carbuncle , and gold : the workmanship of thy tabret and of thy pipe be prepare in thee in the day that thou wast create .
thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and i have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of god ; thou hast walk up and down in the midst of the stone of fire .
thou be perfect in thy way from the day that thou wast create , till iniquity be find in thee .
by the multitude of thy merchandise they have fill the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sin : therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god : and i will destroy thee , o cover cherub , from the midst of the stone of fire .
thine heart be lift up because of thy beauty , thou hast corrupt thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness : i will cast thee to the ground , i will lay thee before king , that they may behold thee .
thou hast defile thy sanctuary by the multitude of thine iniquity , by the iniquity of thy traffick ; therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee , it shall devour thee , and i will bring thee to ash upon the earth in the sight of all they that behold thee .
all they that know thee among the people shall be astonish at thee : thou shalt be a terror , and never shalt thou be any more .
again the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , set thy face against zidon , and prophesy against it ,
and say , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i be against thee , o zidon ; and i will be glorified in the midst of thee : and they shall know that i be the lord , when i shall have execute judgment in she , and shall be sanctify in she .
for i will send into she pestilence , and blood into she street ; and the wounded shall be judge in the midst of she by the sword upon she on every side ; and they shall know that i be the lord .
and there shall be no more a prick brier unto the house of israel , nor any grieving thorn of all that be round about they , that despise they ; and they shall know that i be the lord god .
thus saith the lord god ; when i shall have gather the house of israel from the people among whom they be scatter , and shall be sanctify in they in the sight of the heathen , then shall they dwell in they land that i have give to my servant jacob .
and they shall dwell safely therein , and shall build house , and plant vineyard ; yea , they shall dwell with confidence , when i have execute judgment upon all those that despise they round about they ; and they shall know that i be the lord they god .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , in the twelfth day of the month , the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , set thy face against pharaoh king of egypt , and prophesy against he , and against all egypt :
speak , and say , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i be against thee , pharaoh king of egypt , the great dragon that lieth in the midst of he river , which have say , my river be mine own , and i have make it for myself .
but i will put hook in thy jaw , and i will cause the fish of thy river to stick unto thy scale , and i will bring thee up out of the midst of thy river , and all the fish of thy river shall stick unto thy scale .
and i will leave thee throw into the wilderness , thee and all the fish of thy river : thou shalt fall upon the open field ; thou shalt not be bring together , nor gather : i have give thee for meat to the beast of the field and to the fowl of the heaven .
and all the inhabitant of egypt shall know that i be the lord , because they have be a staff of reed to the house of israel .
when they take hold of thee by thy hand , thou didst break , and rend all they shoulder : and when they lean upon thee , thou brakest , and madest all they loin to be at a stand .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will bring a sword upon thee , and cut off man and beast out of thee .
and the land of egypt shall be desolate and waste ; and they shall know that i be the lord : because he have say , the river be mine , and i have make it .
behold , therefore i be against thee , and against thy river , and i will make the land of egypt utterly waste and desolate , from the tower of syene even unto the border of ethiopia .
no foot of man shall pass through it , nor foot of beast shall pass through it , neither shall it be inhabit forty year .
and i will make the land of egypt desolate in the midst of the country that be desolate , and she city among the city that be lay waste shall be desolate forty year : and i will scatter the egyptians among the nation , and will disperse they through the country .
yet thus saith the lord god ; at the end of forty year will i gather the egyptians from the people whither they be scatter :
and i will bring again the captivity of egypt , and will cause they to return into the land of pathros , into the land of they habitation ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
it shall be the basest of the kingdom ; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nation : for i will diminish they , that they shall no more rule over the nation .
and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of israel , which bringeth they iniquity to remembrance , when they shall look after they : but they shall know that i be the lord god .
and it come to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , nebuchadrezzar king of babylon cause he army to serve a great service against tyrus : every head be make bald , and every shoulder be peel : yet have he no wages , nor he army , for tyrus , for the service that he have serve against it :
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will give the land of egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon ; and he shall take she multitude , and take she spoil , and take she prey ; and it shall be the wages for he army .
i have give he the land of egypt for he labour wherewith he serve against it , because they work for i , saith the lord god .
in that day will i cause the horn of the house of israel to bud forth , and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of they ; and they shall know that i be the lord .
the word of the lord come again unto i , say ,
son of man , prophesy and say , thus saith the lord god ; howl ye , woe worth the day !
for the day be near , even the day of the lord be near , a cloudy day ; it shall be the time of the heathen .
and the sword shall come upon egypt , and great pain shall be in ethiopia , when the slay shall fall in egypt , and they shall take away she multitude , and she foundation shall be break down .
ethiopia , and libya , and lydia , and all the mingled people , and chub , and the man of the land that be in league , shall fall with they by the sword .
thus saith the lord ; they also that uphold egypt shall fall ; and the pride of she power shall come down : from the tower of syene shall they fall in it by the sword , saith the lord god .
and they shall be desolate in the midst of the country that be desolate , and she city shall be in the midst of the city that be waste .
and they shall know that i be the lord , when i have set a fire in egypt , and when all she helper shall be destroy .
in that day shall messenger go forth from i in ship to make the careless ethiopians afraid , and great pain shall come upon they , as in the day of egypt : for , lo , it cometh .
thus saith the lord god ; i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon .
he and he people with he , the terrible of the nation , shall be bring to destroy the land : and they shall draw they sword against egypt , and fill the land with the slay .
and i will make the river dry , and sell the land into the hand of the wicked : and i will make the land waste , and all that be therein , by the hand of stranger : i the lord have speak it .
thus saith the lord god ; i will also destroy the idol , and i will cause they image to cease out of noph ; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of egypt : and i will put a fear in the land of egypt .
and i will make pathros desolate , and will set fire in zoan , and will execute judgment in no. .
and i will pour my fury upon sin , the strength of egypt ; and i will cut off the multitude of no. .
and i will set fire in egypt : sin shall have great pain , and no shall be rent asunder , and noph shall have distress daily .
the young man of aven and of pibeseth shall fall by the sword : and these city shall go into captivity .
at tehaphnehes also the day shall be darken , when i shall break there the yoke of egypt : and the pomp of she strength shall cease in she : as for she , a cloud shall cover she , and she daughter shall go into captivity .
thus will i execute judgment in egypt : and they shall know that i be the lord .
and it come to pass in the eleventh year , in the first month , in the seventh day of the month , that the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , i have break the arm of pharaoh king of egypt ; and , lo , it shall not be bind up to be heal , to put a roller to bind it , to make it strong to hold the sword .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i be against pharaoh king of egypt , and will break he arm , the strong , and that which be break ; and i will cause the sword to fall out of he hand .
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nation , and will disperse they through the country .
and i will strengthen the arm of the king of babylon , and put my sword in he hand : but i will break pharaoh 's arm , and he shall groan before he with the groaning of a deadly wounded man .
but i will strengthen the arm of the king of babylon , and the arm of pharaoh shall fall down ; and they shall know that i be the lord , when i shall put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon , and he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt .
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nation , and disperse they among the country ; and they shall know that i be the lord .
and it come to pass in the eleventh year , in the third month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , speak unto pharaoh king of egypt , and to he multitude ; whom art thou like in thy greatness ?
behold , the assyrian be a cedar in lebanon with fair branch , and with a shadow shroud , and of a high stature ; and he top be among the thick bough .
the water make he great , the deep set he up on high with she river run round about he plant , and send out she little river unto all the tree of the field .
therefore he height be exalt above all the tree of the field , and he bough be multiply , and he branch become long because of the multitude of water , when he shoot forth .
all the fowl of heaven make they nest in he bough , and under he branch do all the beast of the field bring forth they young , and under he shadow dwelt all great nation .
thus be he fair in he greatness , in the length of he branch : for he root be by great water .
the cedar in the garden of god could not hide he : the fir tree be not like he bough , and the chestnut tree be not like he branch ; nor any tree in the garden of god be like unto he in he beauty .
i have make he fair by the multitude of he branch : so that all the tree of eden , that be in the garden of god , envy he .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because thou hast lift up thyself in height , and he have shoot up he top among the thick bough , and he heart be lift up in he height ;
i have therefore deliver he into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen ; he shall surely deal with he : i have drive he out for he wickedness .
and stranger , the terrible of the nation , have cut he off , and have leave he : upon the mountain and in all the valley he branch be fall , and he bough be break by all the river of the land ; and all the people of the earth be go down from he shadow , and have leave he .
upon he ruin shall all the fowl of the heaven remain , and all the beast of the field shall be upon he branch :
to the end that none of all the tree by the water exalt themselves for they height , neither shoot up they top among the thick bough , neither they tree stand up in they height , all that drink water : for they be all deliver unto death , to the nether part of the earth , in the midst of the child of man , with they that go down to the pit .
thus saith the lord god ; in the day when he go down to the grave i cause a mourning : i cover the deep for he , and i restrain the flood thereof , and the great water be stay : and i cause lebanon to mourn for he , and all the tree of the field faint for he .
i make the nation to shake at the sound of he fall , when i cast he down to hell with they that descend into the pit : and all the tree of eden , the choice and best of lebanon , all that drink water , shall be comfort in the nether part of the earth .
they also go down into hell with he unto they that be slay with the sword ; and they that be he arm , that dwell under he shadow in the midst of the heathen .
to whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the tree of eden ? yet shalt thou be bring down with the tree of eden unto the nether part of the earth : thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with they that be slay by the sword .
this be pharaoh and all he multitude , saith the lord god .
and it come to pass in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , take up a lamentation for pharaoh king of egypt , and say unto he , thou art like a young lion of the nation , and thou art as a whale in the sea : and thou camest forth with thy river , and troubledst the water with thy foot , and fouledst they river .
thus saith the lord god ; i will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people ; and they shall bring thee up in my net .
then will i leave thee upon the land , i will cast thee forth upon the open field , and will cause all the fowl of the heaven to remain upon thee , and i will fill the beast of the whole earth with thee .
and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountain , and fill the valley with thy height .
i will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest , even to the mountain ; and the river shall be full of thee .
and when i shall put thee out , i will cover the heaven , and make the star thereof dark ; i will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give she light .
all the bright light of heaven will i make dark over thee , and set darkness upon thy land , saith the lord god .
i will also vex the heart of many people , when i shall bring thy destruction among the nation , into the country which thou hast not know .
yea , i will make many people amaze at thee , and they king shall be horribly afraid for thee , when i shall brandish my sword before they ; and they shall tremble at every moment , every man for he own life , in the day of thy fall .
for thus saith the lord god ; the sword of the king of babylon shall come upon thee .
by the sword of the mighty will i cause thy multitude to fall , the terrible of the nation , all of they : and they shall spoil the pomp of egypt , and all the multitude thereof shall be destroy .
i will destroy also all the beast thereof from beside the great water ; neither shall the foot of man trouble they any more , nor the hoof of beast trouble they .
then will i make they water deep , and cause they river to run like oil , saith the lord god .
when i shall make the land of egypt desolate , and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it be full , when i shall smite all they that dwell therein , then shall they know that i be the lord .
this be the lamentation wherewith they shall lament she : the daughter of the nation shall lament she : they shall lament for she , even for egypt , and for all she multitude , saith the lord god .
it come to pass also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth day of the month , that the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , wail for the multitude of egypt , and cast they down , even she , and the daughter of the famous nation , unto the nether part of the earth , with they that go down into the pit .
whom dost thou pass in beauty ? go down , and be thou lay with the uncircumcised .
they shall fall in the midst of they that be slay by the sword : she be deliver to the sword : draw she and all she multitude .
the strong among the mighty shall speak to he out of the midst of hell with they that help he : they be go down , they lie uncircumcised , slay by the sword .
asshur be there and all she company : he grave be about he : all of they slay , fall by the sword :
whose grave be set in the side of the pit , and she company be round about she grave : all of they slay , fall by the sword , which cause terror in the land of the living .
there be elam and all she multitude round about she grave , all of they slay , fall by the sword , which be go down uncircumcised into the nether part of the earth , which cause they terror in the land of the living ; yet have they bear they shame with they that go down to the pit .
they have set she a bed in the midst of the slay with all she multitude : she grave be round about he : all of they uncircumcised , slay by the sword : though they terror be cause in the land of the living , yet have they bear they shame with they that go down to the pit : he be put in the midst of they that be slay .
there be meshech , tubal , and all she multitude : she grave be round about he : all of they uncircumcised , slay by the sword , though they cause they terror in the land of the living .
and they shall not lie with the mighty that be fall of the uncircumcised , which be go down to hell with they weapon of war : and they have lay they sword under they head , but they iniquity shall be upon they bone , though they be the terror of the mighty in the land of the living .
yea , thou shalt be break in the midst of the uncircumcised , and shalt lie with they that be slay with the sword .
there be edom , she king , and all she prince , which with they might be lay by they that be slay by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with they that go down to the pit .
there be the prince of the north , all of they , and all the zidonians , which be go down with the slay ; with they terror they be ashamed of they might ; and they lie uncircumcised with they that be slay by the sword , and bear they shame with they that go down to the pit .
pharaoh shall see they , and shall be comfort over all he multitude , even pharaoh and all he army slay by the sword , saith the lord god .
for i have cause my terror in the land of the living : and he shall be lay in the midst of the uncircumcised with they that be slay with the sword , even pharaoh and all he multitude , saith the lord god .
again the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , speak to the child of thy people , and say unto they , when i bring the sword upon a land , if the people of the land take a man of they coast , and set he for they watchman :
if when he seeth the sword come upon the land , he blow the trumpet , and warn the people ;
then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet , and taketh not warn ; if the sword come , and take he away , he blood shall be upon he own head .
he hear the sound of the trumpet , and take not warn ; he blood shall be upon he .
but he that taketh warn shall deliver he soul .
but if the watchman see the sword come , and blow not the trumpet , and the people be not warn ; if the sword come , and take any person from among they , he be take away in he iniquity ; but he blood will i require at the watchman 's hand .
so thou , o son of man , i have set thee a watchman unto the house of israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn they from i .
when i say unto the wicked , o wicked man , thou shalt surely die ; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from he way , that wicked man shall die in he iniquity ; but he blood will i require at thine hand .
nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of he way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from he way , he shall die in he iniquity ; but thou hast deliver thy soul .
therefore , o thou son of man , speak unto the house of israel ; thus ye speak , say , if we transgression and we sin be upon we , and we pine away in they , how should we then live ?
say unto they , as i live , saith the lord god , i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked ; but that the wicked turn from he way and live : turn ye , turn ye from you evil way ; for why will ye die , o house of israel ?
therefore , thou son of man , say unto the child of thy people , the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver he in the day of he transgression : as for the wickedness of the wicked , he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from he wickedness ; neither shall the righteous be able to live for he righteousness in the day that he sinneth .
when i shall say to the righteous , that he shall surely live ; if he trust to he own righteousness , and commit iniquity , all he righteousness shall not be remember ; but for he iniquity that he have commit , he shall die for it .
again , when i say unto the wicked , thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from he sin , and do that which be lawful and right ;
if the wicked restore the pledge , give again that he have rob , walk in the statute of life , without commit iniquity ; he shall surely live , he shall not die .
none of he sin that he have committed shall be mention unto he : he have do that which be lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
yet the child of thy people say , the way of the lord be not equal : but as for they , they way be not equal .
when the righteous turneth from he righteousness , and committeth iniquity , he shall even die thereby .
but if the wicked turn from he wickedness , and do that which be lawful and right , he shall live thereby .
yet ye say , the way of the lord be not equal .
o ye house of israel , i will judge you every one after he way .
and it come to pass in the twelfth year of we captivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that have escape out of jerusalem come unto i , say , the city be smitten .
now the hand of the lord be upon i in the evening , afore he that be escape come ; and have open my mouth , until he come to i in the morning ; and my mouth be open , and i be no more dumb .
then the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , they that inhabit those waste of the land of israel speak , say , abraham be one , and he inherit the land : but we be many ; the land be give we for inheritance .
wherefore say unto they , thus saith the lord god ; ye eat with the blood , and lift up you eye toward you idol , and shed blood : and shall ye possess the land ?
ye stand upon you sword , ye work abomination , and ye defile every one he neighbour 's wife : and shall ye possess the land ?
say thou thus unto they , thus saith the lord god ; as i live , surely they that be in the waste shall fall by the sword , and he that be in the open field will i give to the beast to be devour , and they that be in the fort and in the cave shall die of the pestilence .
for i will lay the land most desolate , and the pomp of she strength shall cease ; and the mountain of israel shall be desolate , that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that i be the lord , when i have lay the land most desolate because of all they abomination which they have commit .
also , thou son of man , the child of thy people still be talk against thee by the wall and in the door of the house , and speak one to another , every one to he brother , say , come , i pray you , and hear what be the word that cometh forth from the lord .
and they come unto thee as the people cometh , and they sit before thee as my people , and they hear thy word , but they will not do they : for with they mouth they shew much love , but they heart goeth after they covetousness .
and , lo , thou art unto they as a very lovely song of one that have a pleasant voice , and can play well on a instrument : for they hear thy word , but they do they not .
and when this cometh to pass , ( lo , it will come , ) then shall they know that a prophet have be among they .
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , prophesy against the shepherd of israel , prophesy , and say unto they , thus saith the lord god unto the shepherd ; woe be to the shepherd of israel that do feed themselves ! should not the shepherd feed the flock ?
ye eat the fat , and ye clothe you with the wool , ye kill they that be feed : but ye feed not the flock .
the diseased have ye not strengthen , neither have ye heal that which be sick , neither have ye bind up that which be break , neither have ye bring again that which be drive away , neither have ye seek that which be lose ; but with force and with cruelty have ye rule they .
and they be scatter , because there be no shepherd : and they become meat to all the beast of the field , when they be scatter .
my sheep wander through all the mountain , and upon every high hill : yea , my flock be scatter upon all the face of the earth , and none do search or seek after they .
therefore , ye shepherd , hear the word of the lord ;
as i live , saith the lord god , surely because my flock become a prey , and my flock become meat to every beast of the field , because there be no shepherd , neither do my shepherd search for my flock , but the shepherd feed themselves , and feed not my flock ;
therefore , o ye shepherd , hear the word of the lord ;
thus saith the lord god ; behold , i be against the shepherd ; and i will require my flock at they hand , and cause they to cease from feed the flock ; neither shall the shepherd feed themselves any more ; for i will deliver my flock from they mouth , that they may not be meat for they .
for thus saith the lord god ; behold , i , even i , will both search my sheep , and seek they out .
as a shepherd seeketh out he flock in the day that he be among he sheep that be scatter ; so will i seek out my sheep , and will deliver they out of all place where they have be scatter in the cloudy and dark day .
and i will bring they out from the people , and gather they from the country , and will bring they to they own land , and feed they upon the mountain of israel by the river , and in all the inhabit place of the country .
i will feed they in a good pasture , and upon the high mountain of israel shall they fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountain of israel .
i will feed my flock , and i will cause they to lie down , saith the lord god .
i will seek that which be lose , and bring again that which be drive away , and will bind up that which be break , and will strengthen that which be sick : but i will destroy the fat and the strong ; i will feed they with judgment .
and as for you , o my flock , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i judge between cattle and cattle , between the ram and the he goat .
seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eat up the good pasture , but ye must tread down with you foot the residue of you pasture ? and to have drunk of the deep water , but ye must foul the residue with you foot ?
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have trodden with you foot ; and they drink that which ye have foul with you foot .
therefore thus saith the lord god unto they ; behold , i , even i , will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle .
because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder , and push all the diseased with you horn , till ye have scatter they abroad ;
therefore will i save my flock , and they shall no more be a prey ; and i will judge between cattle and cattle .
and i will set up one shepherd over they , and he shall feed they , even my servant david ; he shall feed they , and he shall be they shepherd .
and i the lord will be they god , and my servant david a prince among they ; i the lord have speak it .
and i will make with they a covenant of peace , and will cause the evil beast to cease out of the land : and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness , and sleep in the wood .
and i will make they and the place round about my hill a blessing ; and i will cause the shower to come down in he season ; there shall be shower of blessing .
and the tree of the field shall yield she fruit , and the earth shall yield she increase , and they shall be safe in they land , and shall know that i be the lord , when i have break the band of they yoke , and deliver they out of the hand of those that serve themselves of they .
and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen , neither shall the beast of the land devour they ; but they shall dwell safely , and none shall make they afraid .
and i will raise up for they a plant of renown , and they shall be no more consume with hunger in the land , neither bear the shame of the heathen any more .
thus shall they know that i the lord they god be with they , and that they , even the house of israel , be my people , saith the lord god .
and ye my flock , the flock of my pasture , be man , and i be you god , saith the lord god .
moreover the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , set thy face against mount seir , and prophesy against it ,
and say unto it , thus saith the lord god ; behold , o mount seir , i be against thee , and i will stretch out mine hand against thee , and i will make thee most desolate .
i will lay thy city waste , and thou shalt be desolate , and thou shalt know that i be the lord .
because thou hast have a perpetual hatred , and hast shed the blood of the child of israel by the force of the sword in the time of they calamity , in the time that they iniquity have a end :
therefore , as i live , saith the lord god , i will prepare thee unto blood , and blood shall pursue thee : sith thou hast not hate blood , even blood shall pursue thee .
thus will i make mount seir most desolate , and cut off from it he that passeth out and he that returneth .
and i will fill he mountain with he slay man : in thy hill , and in thy valley , and in all thy river , shall they fall that be slay with the sword .
i will make thee perpetual desolation , and thy city shall not return : and ye shall know that i be the lord .
because thou hast say , these two nation and these two country shall be mine , and we will possess it ; whereas the lord be there :
therefore , as i live , saith the lord god , i will even do accord to thine anger , and accord to thine envy which thou hast use out of thy hatred against they ; and i will make myself know among they , when i have judge thee .
and thou shalt know that i be the lord , and that i have hear all thy blasphemy which thou hast speak against the mountain of israel , say , they be lay desolate , they be give we to consume .
thus with you mouth ye have boast against i , and have multiply you word against i : i have hear they .
thus saith the lord god ; when the whole earth rejoiceth , i will make thee desolate .
as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of israel , because it be desolate , so will i do unto thee : thou shalt be desolate , o mount seir , and all idumea , even all of it : and they shall know that i be the lord .
also , thou son of man , prophesy unto the mountain of israel , and say , ye mountain of israel , hear the word of the lord :
thus saith the lord god ; because the enemy have say against you , aha , even the ancient high place be ours in possession :
therefore prophesy and say , thus saith the lord god ; because they have make you desolate , and swallow you up on every side , that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen , and ye be take up in the lip of talker , and be a infamy of the people :
therefore , ye mountain of israel , hear the word of the lord god ; thus saith the lord god to the mountain , and to the hill , to the river , and to the valley , to the desolate waste , and to the city that be forsake , which become a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that be round about ;
therefore thus saith the lord god ; surely in the fire of my jealousy have i speak against the residue of the heathen , and against all idumea , which have appoint my land into they possession with the joy of all they heart , with despiteful mind , to cast it out for a prey .
prophesy therefore concern the land of israel , and say unto the mountain , and to the hill , to the river , and to the valley , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i have speak in my jealousy and in my fury , because ye have bear the shame of the heathen :
therefore thus saith the lord god ; i have lift up mine hand , surely the heathen that be about you , they shall bear they shame .
but ye , o mountain of israel , ye shall shoot forth you branch , and yield you fruit to my people of israel ; for they be at hand to come .
for , behold , i be for you , and i will turn unto you , and ye shall be till and sow :
and i will multiply man upon you , all the house of israel , even all of it : and the city shall be inhabit , and the waste shall be build :
and i will multiply upon you man and beast ; and they shall increase and bring fruit : and i will settle you after you old estate , and will do better unto you than at you beginning : and ye shall know that i be the lord .
yea , i will cause man to walk upon you , even my people israel ; and they shall possess thee , and thou shalt be they inheritance , and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave they of man .
thus saith the lord god ; because they say unto you , thou land devourest up man , and hast bereave thy nation ;
therefore thou shalt devour man no more , neither bereave thy nation any more , saith the lord god .
neither will i cause man to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more , neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause thy nation to fall any more , saith the lord god .
moreover the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , when the house of israel dwelt in they own land , they defile it by they own way and by they doings : they way be before i as the uncleanness of a remove woman .
wherefore i pour my fury upon they for the blood that they have shed upon the land , and for they idol wherewith they have polluted it :
and i scatter they among the heathen , and they be disperse through the country : accord to they way and accord to they doings i judge they .
and when they enter unto the heathen , whither they go , they profane my holy name , when they say to they , these be the people of the lord , and be go forth out of he land .
but i have pity for mine holy name , which the house of israel have profane among the heathen , whither they go .
therefore say unto the house of israel , thus saith the lord god ; i do not this for you sake , o house of israel , but for mine holy name 's sake , which ye have profane among the heathen , whither ye go .
and i will sanctify my great name , which be profane among the heathen , which ye have profane in the midst of they ; and the heathen shall know that i be the lord , saith the lord god , when i shall be sanctify in you before they eye .
for i will take you from among the heathen , and gather you out of all country , and will bring you into you own land .
then will i sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all you filthiness , and from all you idol , will i cleanse you .
a new heart also will i give you , and a new spirit will i put within you : and i will take away the stony heart out of you flesh , and i will give you a heart of flesh .
and i will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statute , and ye shall keep my judgment , and do they .
and ye shall dwell in the land that i give to you father ; and ye shall be my people , and i will be you god .
i will also save you from all you uncleanness : and i will call for the corn , and will increase it , and lay no famine upon you .
and i will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen .
then shall ye remember you own evil way , and you doings that be not good , and shall lothe yourselve in you own sight for you iniquity and for you abomination .
not for you sake do i this , saith the lord god , be it known unto you : be ashamed and confound for you own way , o house of israel .
thus saith the lord god ; in the day that i shall have cleanse you from all you iniquity i will also cause you to dwell in the city , and the waste shall be build .
and the desolate land shall be till , whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that pass by .
and they shall say , this land that be desolate be become like the garden of eden ; and the waste and desolate and ruin city be become fenced , and be inhabit .
then the heathen that be leave round about you shall know that i the lord build the ruin place , and plant that that be desolate : i the lord have speak it , and i will do it .
thus saith the lord god ; i will yet for this be enquire of by the house of israel , to do it for they ; i will increase they with man like a flock .
as the holy flock , as the flock of jerusalem in she solemn feast ; so shall the waste city be fill with flock of man : and they shall know that i be the lord .
the hand of the lord be upon i , and carry i out in the spirit of the lord , and set i down in the midst of the valley which be full of bone ,
and cause i to pass by they round about : and , behold , there be very many in the open valley ; and , lo , they be very dry .
and he say unto i , son of man , can these bone live ?
and i answer , o lord god , thou knowest .
again he say unto i , prophesy upon these bone , and say unto they , o ye dry bone , hear the word of the lord .
thus saith the lord god unto these bone ; behold , i will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live :
and i will lay sinew upon you , and will bring up flesh upon you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that i be the lord .
so i prophesy as i be command : and as i prophesy , there be a noise , and behold a shake , and the bone come together , bone to he bone .
and when i behold , lo , the sinew and the flesh come up upon they , and the skin cover they above : but there be no breath in they .
then say he unto i , prophesy unto the wind , prophesy , son of man , and say to the wind , thus saith the lord god ; come from the four wind , o breath , and breathe upon these slay , that they may live .
so i prophesy as he command i , and the breath come into they , and they live , and stand up upon they foot , a exceed great army .
then he say unto i , son of man , these bone be the whole house of israel : behold , they say , we bone be dry , and we hope be lose : we be cut off for we part .
therefore prophesy and say unto they , thus saith the lord god ; behold , o my people , i will open you grave , and cause you to come up out of you grave , and bring you into the land of israel .
and ye shall know that i be the lord , when i have open you grave , o my people , and bring you up out of you grave ,
and shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and i shall place you in you own land : then shall ye know that i the lord have speak it , and perform it , saith the lord .
the word of the lord come again unto i , say ,
moreover , thou son of man , take thee one stick , and write upon it , for judah , and for the child of israel he companion : then take another stick , and write upon it , for joseph , the stick of ephraim , and for all the house of israel he companion :
and join they one to another into one stick ; and they shall become one in thine hand .
and when the child of thy people shall speak unto thee , say , wilt thou not shew we what thou meanest by these ?
say unto they , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will take the stick of joseph , which be in the hand of ephraim , and the tribe of israel he fellow , and will put they with he , even with the stick of judah , and make they one stick , and they shall be one in mine hand .
and the stick whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before they eye .
and say unto they , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will take the child of israel from among the heathen , whither they be go , and will gather they on every side , and bring they into they own land :
and i will make they one nation in the land upon the mountain of israel ; and one king shall be king to they all : and they shall be no more two nation , neither shall they be divide into two kingdom any more at all :
neither shall they defile themselves any more with they idol , nor with they detestable thing , nor with any of they transgression : but i will save they out of all they dwellingplace , wherein they have sin , and will cleanse they : so shall they be my people , and i will be they god .
and david my servant shall be king over they ; and they all shall have one shepherd : they shall also walk in my judgment , and observe my statute , and do they .
and they shall dwell in the land that i have give unto jacob my servant , wherein you father have dwell ; and they shall dwell therein , even they , and they child , and they child 's child for ever : and my servant david shall be they prince for ever .
moreover i will make a covenant of peace with they ; it shall be a everlasting covenant with they : and i will place they , and multiply they , and will set my sanctuary in the midst of they for evermore .
my tabernacle also shall be with they : yea , i will be they god , and they shall be my people .
and the heathen shall know that i the lord do sanctify israel , when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of they for evermore .
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
son of man , set thy face against gog , the land of magog , the chief prince of meshech and tubal , and prophesy against he ,
and say , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i be against thee , o gog , the chief prince of meshech and tubal :
and i will turn thee back , and put hook into thy jaw , and i will bring thee forth , and all thine army , horse and horseman , all of they clothe with all sort of armour , even a great company with buckler and shield , all of they handle sword :
persia , ethiopia , and libya with they ; all of they with shield and helmet :
gomer , and all he band ; the house of togarmah of the north quarter , and all he band : and many people with thee .
be thou prepared , and prepare for thyself , thou , and all thy company that be assemble unto thee , and be thou a guard unto they .
after many day thou shalt be visit : in the latter year thou shalt come into the land that be bring back from the sword , and be gather out of many people , against the mountain of israel , which have be always waste : but it be bring forth out of the nation , and they shall dwell safely all of they .
thou shalt ascend and come like a storm , thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land , thou , and all thy band , and many people with thee .
thus saith the lord god ; it shall also come to pass , that at the same time shall thing come into thy mind , and thou shalt think a evil thought :
and thou shalt say , i will go up to the land of unwalled village ; i will go to they that be at rest , that dwell safely , all of they dwelling without wall , and have neither bar nor gate ,
to take a spoil , and to take a prey ; to turn thine hand upon the desolate place that be now inhabit , and upon the people that be gather out of the nation , which have get cattle and goods , that dwell in the midst of the land .
sheba , and dedan , and the merchant of tarshish , with all the young lion thereof , shall say unto thee , art thou come to take a spoil ? hast thou gather thy company to take a prey ? to carry away silver and gold , to take away cattle and goods , to take a great spoil ?
therefore , son of man , prophesy and say unto gog , thus saith the lord god ; in that day when my people of israel dwelleth safely , shalt thou not know it ?
and thou shalt come from thy place out of the north part , thou , and many people with thee , all of they ride upon horse , a great company , and a mighty army :
and thou shalt come up against my people of israel , as a cloud to cover the land ; it shall be in the latter day , and i will bring thee against my land , that the heathen may know i , when i shall be sanctify in thee , o gog , before they eye .
thus saith the lord god ; art thou he of whom i have speak in old time by my servant the prophet of israel , which prophesy in those day many year that i would bring thee against they ?
and it shall come to pass at the same time when gog shall come against the land of israel , saith the lord god , that my fury shall come up in my face .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have i speak , surely in that day there shall be a great shake in the land of israel ;
so that the fish of the sea , and the fowl of the heaven , and the beast of the field , and all creep thing that creep upon the earth , and all the man that be upon the face of the earth , shall shake at my presence , and the mountain shall be throw down , and the steep place shall fall , and every wall shall fall to the ground .
and i will call for a sword against he throughout all my mountain , saith the lord god : every man 's sword shall be against he brother .
and i will plead against he with pestilence and with blood ; and i will rain upon he , and upon he band , and upon the many people that be with he , a overflow rain , and great hailstone , fire , and brimstone .
thus will i magnify myself , and sanctify myself ; and i will be know in the eye of many nation , and they shall know that i be the lord .
therefore , thou son of man , prophesy against gog , and say , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i be against thee , o gog , the chief prince of meshech and tubal :
and i will turn thee back , and leave but the sixth part of thee , and will cause thee to come up from the north part , and will bring thee upon the mountain of israel :
and i will smite thy bow out of thy leave hand , and will cause thine arrow to fall out of thy right hand .
thou shalt fall upon the mountain of israel , thou , and all thy band , and the people that be with thee : i will give thee unto the ravenous bird of every sort , and to the beast of the field to be devour .
thou shalt fall upon the open field : for i have speak it , saith the lord god .
and i will send a fire on magog , and among they that dwell carelessly in the isle : and they shall know that i be the lord .
so will i make my holy name know in the midst of my people israel ; and i will not let they pollute my holy name any more : and the heathen shall know that i be the lord , the holy one in israel .
behold , it be come , and it be do , saith the lord god ; this be the day whereof i have speak .
and they that dwell in the city of israel shall go forth , and shall set on fire and burn the weapon , both the shield and the buckler , the bow and the arrow , and the handstave , and the spear , and they shall burn they with fire seven year :
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forest ; for they shall burn the weapon with fire : and they shall spoil those that spoil they , and rob those that rob they , saith the lord god .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that i will give unto gog a place there of grave in israel , the valley of the passenger on the east of the sea : and it shall stop the nose of the passenger : and there shall they bury gog and all he multitude : and they shall call it the valley of hamongog .
and seven month shall the house of israel be bury of they , that they may cleanse the land .
yea , all the people of the land shall bury they ; and it shall be to they a renown the day that i shall be glorified , saith the lord god .
and they shall sever out man of continual employment , pass through the land to bury with the passenger those that remain upon the face of the earth , to cleanse it : after the end of seven month shall they search .
and the passenger that pass through the land , when any seeth a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , till the burier have bury it in the valley of hamongog .
and also the name of the city shall be hamonah .
thus shall they cleanse the land .
and , thou son of man , thus saith the lord god ; speak unto every feathered fowl , and to every beast of the field , assemble yourselve , and come ; gather yourselve on every side to my sacrifice that i do sacrifice for you , even a great sacrifice upon the mountain of israel , that ye may eat flesh , and drink blood .
ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty , and drink the blood of the prince of the earth , of ram , of lamb , and of goat , of bullock , all of they fatling of bashan .
and ye shall eat fat till ye be full , and drink blood till ye be drunken , of my sacrifice which i have sacrifice for you .
thus ye shall be fill at my table with horse and chariot , with mighty man , and with all man of war , saith the lord god .
and i will set my glory among the heathen , and all the heathen shall see my judgment that i have execute , and my hand that i have lay upon they .
so the house of israel shall know that i be the lord they god from that day and forward .
and the heathen shall know that the house of israel go into captivity for they iniquity : because they trespass against i , therefore hide i my face from they , and give they into the hand of they enemy : so fall they all by the sword .
accord to they uncleanness and accord to they transgression have i do unto they , and hide my face from they .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; now will i bring again the captivity of jacob , and have mercy upon the whole house of israel , and will be jealous for my holy name ;
after that they have bear they shame , and all they trespass whereby they have trespass against i , when they dwell safely in they land , and none make they afraid .
when i have bring they again from the people , and gather they out of they enemy ' land , and be sanctify in they in the sight of many nation ;
then shall they know that i be the lord they god , which cause they to be lead into captivity among the heathen : but i have gather they unto they own land , and have leave none of they any more there .
neither will i hide my face any more from they : for i have pour out my spirit upon the house of israel , saith the lord god .
in the five and twentieth year of we captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city be smitten , in the selfsame day the hand of the lord be upon i , and bring i thither .
in the vision of god bring he i into the land of israel , and set i upon a very high mountain , by which be as the frame of a city on the south .
and he bring i thither , and , behold , there be a man , whose appearance be like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in he hand , and a measure reed ; and he stand in the gate .
and the man say unto i , son of man , behold with thine eye , and hear with thine ear , and set thine heart upon all that i shall shew thee ; for to the intent that i might shew they unto thee art thou bring hither : declare all that thou seest to the house of israel .

so he measure the house , a hundred cubit long ; and the separate place , and the building , with the wall thereof , a hundred cubit long ;
also the breadth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , a hundred cubit .
and he measure the length of the building over against the separate place which be behind it , and the gallery thereof on the one side and on the other side , a hundred cubit , with the inner temple , and the porch of the court ;
the door post , and the narrow window , and the gallery round about on they three story , over against the door , ciel with wood round about , and from the ground up to the window , and the window be cover ;
to that above the door , even unto the inner house , and without , and by all the wall round about within and without , by measure .
and it be make with cherubim and palm tree , so that a palm tree be between a cherub and a cherub ; and every cherub have two face ;
so that the face of a man be toward the palm tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side : it be make through all the house round about .
from the ground unto above the door be cherubim and palm tree make , and on the wall of the temple .
the post of the temple be square , and the face of the sanctuary ; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other .
the altar of wood be three cubit high , and the length thereof two cubit ; and the corner thereof , and the length thereof , and the wall thereof , be of wood : and he say unto i , this be the table that be before the lord .
and the temple and the sanctuary have two door .
and the door have two leaf apiece , two turn leaf ; two leaf for the one door , and two leaf for the other door .
and there be make on they , on the door of the temple , cherubim and palm tree , like as be make upon the wall ; and there be thick plank upon the face of the porch without .
and there be narrow window and palm tree on the one side and on the other side , on the side of the porch , and upon the side chamber of the house , and thick plank .
then he bring i forth into the utter court , the way toward the north : and he bring i into the chamber that be over against the separate place , and which be before the building toward the north .
before the length of a hundred cubit be the north door , and the breadth be fifty cubit .
over against the twenty cubit which be for the inner court , and over against the pavement which be for the utter court , be gallery against gallery in three story .
and before the chamber be a walk of ten cubit breadth inward , a way of one cubit ; and they door toward the north .
now the upper chamber be shorter : for the gallery be higher than these , than the lower , and than the middlemost of the building .
for they be in three story , but have not pillar as the pillar of the court : therefore the building be straiten more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground .
and the wall that be without over against the chamber , toward the utter court on the forepart of the chamber , the length thereof be fifty cubit .
for the length of the chamber that be in the utter court be fifty cubit : and , lo , before the temple be a hundred cubit .
and from under these chamber be the entry on the east side , as one goeth into they from the utter court .
the chamber be in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , over against the separate place , and over against the building .
and the way before they be like the appearance of the chamber which be toward the north , as long as they , and as broad as they : and all they going out be both accord to they fashion , and accord to they door .
and accord to the door of the chamber that be toward the south be a door in the head of the way , even the way directly before the wall toward the east , as one entereth into they .
then say he unto i , the north chamber and the south chamber , which be before the separate place , they be holy chamber , where the priest that approach unto the lord shall eat the most holy thing : there shall they lay the most holy thing , and the meat offering , and the sin offering , and the trespass offering ; for the place be holy .
when the priest enter therein , then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court , but there they shall lay they garment wherein they minister ; for they be holy ; and shall put on other garment , and shall approach to those thing which be for the people .
now when he have make a end of measure the inner house , he bring i forth toward the gate whose prospect be toward the east , and measure it round about .
he measure the east side with the measure reed , five hundred reed , with the measure reed round about .
he measure the north side , five hundred reed , with the measure reed round about .
he measure the south side , five hundred reed , with the measure reed .
he turn about to the west side , and measure five hundred reed with the measure reed .
he measure it by the four side : it have a wall round about , five hundred reed long , and five hundred broad , to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place .
afterward he bring i to the gate , even the gate that looketh toward the east :
and , behold , the glory of the god of israel come from the way of the east : and he voice be like a noise of many water : and the earth shine with he glory .
and it be accord to the appearance of the vision which i see , even accord to the vision that i see when i come to destroy the city : and the vision be like the vision that i see by the river chebar ; and i fall upon my face .
and the glory of the lord come into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect be toward the east .
so the spirit take i up , and bring i into the inner court ; and , behold , the glory of the lord fill the house .
and i hear he speak unto i out of the house ; and the man stand by i .
and he say unto i , son of man , the place of my throne , and the place of the sole of my foot , where i will dwell in the midst of the child of israel for ever , and my holy name , shall the house of israel no more defile , neither they , nor they king , by they whoredom , nor by the carcase of they king in they high place .
in they setting of they threshold by my threshold , and they post by my post , and the wall between i and they , they have even defile my holy name by they abomination that they have commit : wherefore i have consume they in mine anger .
now let they put away they whoredom , and the carcase of they king , far from i , and i will dwell in the midst of they for ever .
thou son of man , shew the house to the house of israel , that they may be ashamed of they iniquity : and let they measure the pattern .
and if they be ashamed of all that they have do , shew they the form of the house , and the fashion thereof , and the going out thereof , and the coming in thereof , and all the form thereof , and all the ordinance thereof , and all the form thereof , and all the law thereof : and write it in they sight , that they may keep the whole form thereof , and all the ordinance thereof , and do they .
this be the law of the house ; upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy .
behold , this be the law of the house .
and these be the measure of the altar after the cubit : the cubit be a cubit and a hand breadth ; even the bottom shall be a cubit , and the breadth a cubit , and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span : and this shall be the higher place of the altar .
and from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubit , and the breadth one cubit ; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubit , and the breadth one cubit .
so the altar shall be four cubit ; and from the altar and upward shall be four horn .
and the altar shall be twelve cubit long , twelve broad , square in the four square thereof .
and the settle shall be fourteen cubit long and fourteen broad in the four square thereof ; and the border about it shall be half a cubit ; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about ; and he stair shall look toward the east .
and he say unto i , son of man , thus saith the lord god ; these be the ordinance of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offering thereon , and to sprinkle blood thereon .
and thou shalt give to the priest the levites that be of the seed of zadok , which approach unto i , to minister unto i , saith the lord god , a young bullock for a sin offering .
and thou shalt take of the blood thereof , and put it on the four horn of it , and on the four corner of the settle , and upon the border round about : thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it .
thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering , and he shall burn it in the appoint place of the house , without the sanctuary .
and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goat without blemish for a sin offering ; and they shall cleanse the altar , as they do cleanse it with the bullock .
when thou hast make a end of cleanse it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
and thou shalt offer they before the lord , and the priest shall cast salt upon they , and they shall offer they up for a burnt offering unto the lord .
seven day shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering : they shall also prepare a young bullock , and a ram out of the flock , without blemish .
seven day shall they purge the altar and purify it ; and they shall consecrate themselves .
and when these day be expire , it shall be , that upon the eighth day , and so forward , the priest shall make you burnt offering upon the altar , and you peace offering ; and i will accept you , saith the lord god .
then he bring i back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east ; and it be shut .
then say the lord unto i ; this gate shall be shut , it shall not be open , and no man shall enter in by it ; because the lord , the god of israel , have enter in by it , therefore it shall be shut .
it be for the prince ; the prince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the lord ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then bring he i the way of the north gate before the house : and i look , and , behold , the glory of the lord fill the house of the lord : and i fall upon my face .
and the lord say unto i , son of man , mark well , and behold with thine eye , and hear with thine ear all that i say unto thee concern all the ordinance of the house of the lord , and all the law thereof ; and mark well the enter in of the house , with every go forth of the sanctuary .
and thou shalt say to the rebellious , even to the house of israel , thus saith the lord god ; o ye house of israel , let it suffice you of all you abomination ,
in that ye have bring into my sanctuary stranger , uncircumcised in heart , and uncircumcised in flesh , to be in my sanctuary , to pollute it , even my house , when ye offer my bread , the fat and the blood , and they have break my covenant because of all you abomination .
and ye have not keep the charge of mine holy thing : but ye have set keeper of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselve .
thus saith the lord god ; no stranger , uncircumcised in heart , nor uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into my sanctuary , of any stranger that be among the child of israel .
and the levites that be go away far from i , when israel go astray , which go astray away from i after they idol ; they shall even bear they iniquity .
yet they shall be minister in my sanctuary , have charge at the gate of the house , and minister to the house : they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before they to minister unto they .
because they minister unto they before they idol , and cause the house of israel to fall into iniquity ; therefore have i lift up mine hand against they , saith the lord god , and they shall bear they iniquity .
and they shall not come near unto i , to do the office of a priest unto i , nor to come near to any of my holy thing , in the most holy place : but they shall bear they shame , and they abomination which they have commit .
but i will make they keeper of the charge of the house , for all the service thereof , and for all that shall be do therein .
but the priest the levites , the son of zadok , that keep the charge of my sanctuary when the child of israel go astray from i , they shall come near to i to minister unto i , and they shall stand before i to offer unto i the fat and the blood , saith the lord god :
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto i , and they shall keep my charge .
and it shall come to pass , that when they enter in at the gate of the inner court , they shall be clothe with linen garment ; and no wool shall come upon they , while they minister in the gate of the inner court , and within .
they shall have linen bonnet upon they head , and shall have linen breeches upon they loin ; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat .
and when they go forth into the utter court , even into the utter court to the people , they shall put off they garment wherein they minister , and lay they in the holy chamber , and they shall put on other garment ; and they shall not sanctify the people with they garment .
neither shall they shave they head , nor suffer they lock to grow long ; they shall only poll they head .
neither shall any priest drink wine , when they enter into the inner court .
neither shall they take for they wife a widow , nor she that be put away : but they shall take maiden of the seed of the house of israel , or a widow that have a priest before .
and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane , and cause they to discern between the unclean and the clean .
and in controversy they shall stand in judgment ; and they shall judge it accord to my judgment : and they shall keep my law and my statute in all mine assembly ; and they shall hallow my sabbath .
and they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves : but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister that have have no husband , they may defile themselves .
and after he be cleansed , they shall reckon unto he seven day .
and in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary , unto the inner court , to minister in the sanctuary , he shall offer he sin offering , saith the lord god .
and it shall be unto they for a inheritance : i be they inheritance : and ye shall give they no possession in israel : i be they possession .
they shall eat the meat offering , and the sin offering , and the trespass offering : and every dedicated thing in israel shall be theirs .
and the first of all the firstfruit of all thing , and every oblation of all , of every sort of you oblation , shall be the priest 's : ye shall also give unto the priest the first of you dough , that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house .
the priest shall not eat of any thing that be dead of itself , or tear , whether it be fowl or beast .
moreover , when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance , ye shall offer a oblation unto the lord , a holy portion of the land : the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reed , and the breadth shall be ten thousand .
this shall be holy in all the border thereof round about .
of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length , with five hundred in breadth , square round about ; and fifty cubit round about for the suburb thereof .
and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place .
the holy portion of the land shall be for the priest the minister of the sanctuary , which shall come near to minister unto the lord : and it shall be a place for they house , and a holy place for the sanctuary .
and the five and twenty thousand of length , and the ten thousand of breadth , shall also the levites , the minister of the house , have for themselves , for a possession for twenty chamber .
and ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and five and twenty thousand long , over against the oblation of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of israel .
and a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion , and of the possession of the city , before the oblation of the holy portion , and before the possession of the city , from the west side westward , and from the east side eastward : and the length shall be over against one of the portion , from the west border unto the east border .
in the land shall be he possession in israel : and my prince shall no more oppress my people ; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of israel accord to they tribe .
thus saith the lord god ; let it suffice you , o prince of israel : remove violence and spoil , and execute judgment and justice , take away you exaction from my people , saith the lord god .
ye shall have just balance , and a just ephah , and a just bath .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer , and the ephah the tenth part of a homer : the measure thereof shall be after the homer .
and the shekel shall be twenty gerah : twenty shekel , five and twenty shekel , fifteen shekel , shall be you maneh .
this be the oblation that ye shall offer ; the sixth part of a ephah of a homer of wheat , and ye shall give the sixth part of a ephah of a homer of barley :
concern the ordinance of oil , the bath of oil , ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor , which be a homer of ten bath ; for ten bath be a homer :
and one lamb out of the flock , out of two hundred , out of the fat pasture of israel ; for a meat offering , and for a burnt offering , and for peace offering , to make reconciliation for they , saith the lord god .
all the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in israel .
and it shall be the prince 's part to give burnt offering , and meat offering , and drink offering , in the feast , and in the new moon , and in the sabbath , in all solemnity of the house of israel : he shall prepare the sin offering , and the meat offering , and the burnt offering , and the peace offering , to make reconciliation for the house of israel .
thus saith the lord god ; in the first month , in the first day of the month , thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish , and cleanse the sanctuary :
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it upon the post of the house , and upon the four corner of the settle of the altar , and upon the post of the gate of the inner court .
and so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth , and for he that be simple : so shall ye reconcile the house .
in the first month , in the fourteenth day of the month , ye shall have the passover , a feast of seven day ; unleavened bread shall be eat .
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering .
and seven day of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the lord , seven bullock and seven ram without blemish daily the seven day ; and a kid of the goat daily for a sin offering .
and he shall prepare a meat offering of a ephah for a bullock , and a ephah for a ram , and a hin of oil for a ephah .
in the seventh month , in the fifteenth day of the month , shall he do the like in the feast of the seven day , accord to the sin offering , accord to the burnt offering , and accord to the meat offering , and accord to the oil .
thus saith the lord god ; the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six work day ; but on the sabbath it shall be open , and in the day of the new moon it shall be open .
and the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without , and shall stand by the post of the gate , and the priest shall prepare he burnt offering and he peace offering , and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate : then he shall go forth ; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening .
likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the lord in the sabbath and in the new moon .
and the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the lord in the sabbath day shall be six lamb without blemish , and a ram without blemish .
and the meat offering shall be a ephah for a ram , and the meat offering for the lamb as he shall be able to give , and a hin of oil to a ephah .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish , and six lamb , and a ram : they shall be without blemish .
and he shall prepare a meat offering , a ephah for a bullock , and a ephah for a ram , and for the lamb accord as he hand shall attain unto , and a hin of oil to a ephah .
and when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way thereof .
but when the people of the land shall come before the lord in the solemn feast , he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate ; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate : he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he come in , but shall go forth over against it .
and the prince in the midst of they , when they go in , shall go in ; and when they go forth , shall go forth .
and in the feast and in the solemnity the meat offering shall be a ephah to a bullock , and a ephah to a ram , and to the lamb as he be able to give , and a hin of oil to a ephah .
now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offering voluntarily unto the lord , one shall then open he the gate that looketh toward the east , and he shall prepare he burnt offering and he peace offering , as he do on the sabbath day : then he shall go forth ; and after he go forth one shall shut the gate .
thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the lord of a lamb of the first year without blemish : thou shalt prepare it every morning .
and thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning , the sixth part of a ephah , and the third part of a hin of oil , to temper with the fine flour ; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the lord .
thus shall they prepare the lamb , and the meat offering , and the oil , every morning for a continual burnt offering .
thus saith the lord god ; if the prince give a gift unto any of he son , the inheritance thereof shall be he son ' ; it shall be they possession by inheritance .
but if he give a gift of he inheritance to one of he servant , then it shall be he to the year of liberty ; after it shall return to the prince : but he inheritance shall be he son ' for they .
moreover the prince shall not take of the people 's inheritance by oppression , to thrust they out of they possession ; but he shall give he son inheritance out of he own possession : that my people be not scatter every man from he possession .
after he bring i through the entry , which be at the side of the gate , into the holy chamber of the priest , which look toward the north : and , behold , there be a place on the two side westward .
then say he unto i , this be the place where the priest shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering , where they shall bake the meat offering ; that they bear they not out into the utter court , to sanctify the people .
then he bring i forth into the utter court , and cause i to pass by the four corner of the court ; and , behold , in every corner of the court there be a court .
in the four corner of the court there be court join of forty cubit long and thirty broad : these four corner be of one measure .
and there be a row of building round about in they , round about they four , and it be make with boil place under the row round about .
then say he unto i , these be the place of they that boil , where the minister of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people .
afterward he bring i again unto the door of the house ; and , behold , water issue out from under the threshold of the house eastward : for the forefront of the house stand toward the east , and the water come down from under from the right side of the house , at the south side of the altar .
then bring he i out of the way of the gate northward , and lead i about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward ; and , behold , there run out water on the right side .
and when the man that have the line in he hand go forth eastward , he measure a thousand cubit , and he bring i through the water ; the water be to the ankle .
again he measure a thousand , and bring i through the water ; the water be to the knee .
again he measure a thousand , and bring i through ; the water be to the loin .
afterward he measure a thousand ; and it be a river that i could not pass over : for the water be rise , water to swim in , a river that could not be pass over .
and he say unto i , son of man , hast thou see this ?
then he bring i , and cause i to return to the brink of the river .
now when i have return , behold , at the bank of the river be very many tree on the one side and on the other .
then say he unto i , these water issue out toward the east country , and go down into the desert , and go into the sea : which be bring forth into the sea , the water shall be heal .
and it shall come to pass , that every thing that liveth , which moveth , whithersoever the river shall come , shall live : and there shall be a very great multitude of fish , because these water shall come thither : for they shall be heal ; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh .
and it shall come to pass , that the fisher shall stand upon it from engedi even unto eneglaim ; they shall be a place to spread forth net ; they fish shall be accord to they kind , as the fish of the great sea , exceed many .
but the miry place thereof and the marish thereof shall not be heal ; they shall be give to salt .
and by the river upon the bank thereof , on this side and on that side , shall grow all tree for meat , whose leaf shall not fade , neither shall the fruit thereof be consume : it shall bring forth new fruit accord to he month , because they water they issue out of the sanctuary : and the fruit thereof shall be for meat , and the leaf thereof for medicine .

and the lord give jehoiakim king of judah into he hand , with part of the vessel of the house of god : which he carry into the land of shinar to the house of he god ; and he bring the vessel into the treasure house of he god .
and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of he eunuch , that he should bring certain of the child of israel , and of the king 's seed , and of the prince ;
child in whom be no blemish , but well favoured , and skilful in all wisdom , and cunning in knowledge , and understand science , and such as have ability in they to stand in the king 's palace , and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the chaldeans .
and the king appoint they a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he drink : so nourishing they three year , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
now among these be of the child of judah , daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah :
unto whom the prince of the eunuch give name : for he give unto daniel the name of belteshazzar ; and to hananiah , of shadrach ; and to mishael , of meshach ; and to azariah , of abednego .
but daniel purpose in he heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king 's meat , nor with the wine which he drink : therefore he request of the prince of the eunuch that he might not defile himself .
now god have bring daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuch .
and the prince of the eunuch say unto daniel , i fear my lord the king , who have appoint you meat and you drink : for why should he see you face worse liking than the child which be of you sort ? then shall ye make i endanger my head to the king .
then say daniel to melzar , whom the prince of the eunuch have set over daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah ,
prove thy servant , i beseech thee , ten day ; and let they give we pulse to eat , and water to drink .
then let we countenance be look upon before thee , and the countenance of the child that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as thou seest , deal with thy servant .
so he consent to they in this matter , and prove they ten day .
and at the end of ten day they countenance appear fairer and fatter in flesh than all the child which do eat the portion of the king 's meat .
thus melzar take away the portion of they meat , and the wine that they should drink ; and give they pulse .
as for these four child , god give they knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom : and daniel have understanding in all vision and dream .
now at the end of the day that the king have say he should bring they in , then the prince of the eunuch bring they in before nebuchadnezzar .
and the king commune with they ; and among they all be find none like daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah : therefore stand they before the king .
and in all matter of wisdom and understanding , that the king enquire of they , he find they ten time better than all the magician and astrologer that be in all he realm .
and daniel continue even unto the first year of king cyrus .
and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar dream dream , wherewith he spirit be trouble , and he sleep brake from he .
then the king command to call the magician , and the astrologer , and the sorcerer , and the chaldeans , for to shew the king he dream .
so they come and stand before the king .
and the king say unto they , i have dream a dream , and my spirit be trouble to know the dream .
then speak the chaldeans to the king in syriack , o king , live for ever : tell thy servant the dream , and we will shew the interpretation .
the king answer and say to the chaldeans , the thing be go from i : if ye will not make known unto i the dream , with the interpretation thereof , ye shall be cut in piece , and you house shall be make a dunghill .
but if ye shew the dream , and the interpretation thereof , ye shall receive of i gift and reward and great honour : therefore shew i the dream , and the interpretation thereof .
they answer again and say , let the king tell he servant the dream , and we will shew the interpretation of it .
the king answer and say , i know of certainty that ye would gain the time , because ye see the thing be go from i .
but if ye will not make known unto i the dream , there be but one decree for you : for ye have prepare lie and corrupt word to speak before i , till the time be change : therefore tell i the dream , and i shall know that ye can shew i the interpretation thereof .
the chaldeans answer before the king , and say , there be not a man upon the earth that can shew the king 's matter : therefore there be no king , lord , nor ruler , that ask such thing at any magician , or astrologer , or chaldean .
and it be a rare thing that the king requireth , and there be none other that can shew it before the king , except the god , whose dwelling be not with flesh .
for this cause the king be angry and very furious , and command to destroy all the wise man of babylon .
and the decree go forth that the wise man should be slay ; and they seek daniel and he fellow to be slay .
then daniel answer with counsel and wisdom to arioch the captain of the king 's guard , which be go forth to slay the wise man of babylon :
he answer and say to arioch the king 's captain , why be the decree so hasty from the king ?
then arioch make the thing know to daniel .
then daniel go in , and desire of the king that he would give he time , and that he would shew the king the interpretation .
then daniel go to he house , and make the thing know to hananiah , mishael , and azariah , he companion :
that they would desire mercy of the god of heaven concern this secret ; that daniel and he fellow should not perish with the rest of the wise man of babylon .
then be the secret reveal unto daniel in a night vision .
then daniel bless the god of heaven .
daniel answer and say , blessed be the name of god for ever and ever : for wisdom and might be he :
and he changeth the time and the season : he removeth king , and setteth up king : he giveth wisdom unto the wise , and knowledge to they that know understanding :
he revealeth the deep and secret thing : he knoweth what be in the darkness , and the light dwelleth with he .
i thank thee , and praise thee , o thou god of my father , who hast give i wisdom and might , and hast make known unto i now what we desire of thee : for thou hast now make known unto we the king 's matter .
therefore daniel go in unto arioch , whom the king have ordain to destroy the wise man of babylon : he go and say thus unto he ; destroy not the wise man of babylon : bring i in before the king , and i will shew unto the king the interpretation .
then arioch bring in daniel before the king in haste , and say thus unto he , i have find a man of the captive of judah , that will make known unto the king the interpretation .
the king answer and say to daniel , whose name be belteshazzar , art thou able to make known unto i the dream which i have see , and the interpretation thereof ?
daniel answer in the presence of the king , and say , the secret which the king have demand can not the wise man , the astrologer , the magician , the soothsayer , shew unto the king ;
but there be a god in heaven that revealeth secret , and maketh know to the king nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter day .
thy dream , and the vision of thy head upon thy bed , be these ;
as for thee , o king , thy thought come into thy mind upon thy bed , what should come to pass hereafter : and he that revealeth secret maketh know to thee what shall come to pass .
but as for i , this secret be not reveal to i for any wisdom that i have more than any living , but for they sake that shall make know the interpretation to the king , and that thou mightest know the thought of thy heart .
thou , o king , sawest , and behold a great image .
this great image , whose brightness be excellent , stand before thee ; and the form thereof be terrible .
this image 's head be of fine gold , he breast and he arm of silver , he belly and he thigh of brass ,
he leg of iron , he foot part of iron and part of clay .
thou sawest till that a stone be cut out without hand , which smite the image upon he foot that be of iron and clay , and brake they to piece .
then be the iron , the clay , the brass , the silver , and the gold , break to piece together , and become like the chaff of the summer threshingfloor ; and the wind carry they away , that no place be find for they : and the stone that smite the image become a great mountain , and fill the whole earth .
this be the dream ; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king .
thou , o king , art a king of king : for the god of heaven have give thee a kingdom , power , and strength , and glory .
and wheresoever the child of man dwell , the beast of the field and the fowl of the heaven have he give into thine hand , and have make thee ruler over they all .
thou art this head of gold .
and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee , and another third kingdom of brass , which shall bear rule over all the earth .
and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : forasmuch as iron breaketh in piece and subdueth all thing : and as iron that breaketh all these , shall it break in piece and bruise .
and whereas thou sawest the foot and toe , part of potter ' clay , and part of iron , the kingdom shall be divide ; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron , forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mix with miry clay .
and as the toe of the foot be part of iron , and part of clay , so the kingdom shall be partly strong , and partly break .
and whereas thou sawest iron mix with miry clay , they shall mingle themselves with the seed of man : but they shall not cleave one to another , even as iron be not mix with clay .
and in the day of these king shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom , which shall never be destroy : and the kingdom shall not be leave to other people , but it shall break in piece and consume all these kingdom , and it shall stand for ever .
forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone be cut out of the mountain without hand , and that it brake in piece the iron , the brass , the clay , the silver , and the gold ; the great god have make know to the king what shall come to pass hereafter : and the dream be certain , and the interpretation thereof sure .
then the king nebuchadnezzar fall upon he face , and worship daniel , and command that they should offer a oblation and sweet odour unto he .
the king answer unto daniel , and say , of a truth it be , that you god be a god of god , and a lord of king , and a revealer of secret , see thou couldest reveal this secret .
then the king make daniel a great man , and give he many great gift , and make he ruler over the whole province of babylon , and chief of the governor over all the wise man of babylon .
then daniel request of the king , and he set shadrach , meshach , and abednego , over the affair of the province of babylon : but daniel sit in the gate of the king .
nebuchadnezzar the king make a image of gold , whose height be threescore cubit , and the breadth thereof six cubit : he set it up in the plain of dura , in the province of babylon .
then nebuchadnezzar the king send to gather together the prince , the governor , and the captain , the judge , the treasurer , the counsellor , the sheriff , and all the ruler of the province , to come to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king have set up .
then the prince , the governor , and captain , the judge , the treasurer , the counsellor , the sheriff , and all the ruler of the province , be gather together unto the dedication of the image that nebuchadnezzar the king have set up ; and they stand before the image that nebuchadnezzar have set up .
then a herald cry aloud , to you it be command , o people , nation , and language ,
that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , dulcimer , and all kind of musick , ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king have set up :
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
therefore at that time , when all the people hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and all kind of musick , all the people , the nation , and the language , fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king have set up .
wherefore at that time certain chaldeans come near , and accuse the jews .
they speak and say to the king nebuchadnezzar , o king , live for ever .
thou , o king , hast make a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kind of musick , shall fall down and worship the golden image :
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth , that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
there be certain jews whom thou hast set over the affair of the province of babylon , shadrach , meshach , and abednego ; these man , o king , have not regard thee : they serve not thy god , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up .
then nebuchadnezzar in he rage and fury command to bring shadrach , meshach , and abednego .
then they bring these man before the king .
nebuchadnezzar spake and say unto they , be it true , o shadrach , meshach , and abednego , do not ye serve my god , nor worship the golden image which i have set up ?
now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kind of musick , ye fall down and worship the image which i have make ; well : but if ye worship not , ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace ; and who be that god that shall deliver you out of my hand ?
shadrach , meshach , and abednego , answer and say to the king , o nebuchadnezzar , we be not careful to answer thee in this matter .
if it be so , we god whom we serve be able to deliver we from the burning fiery furnace , and he will deliver we out of thine hand , o king .
but if not , be it known unto thee , o king , that we will not serve thy god , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up .
then be nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of he visage be change against shadrach , meshach , and abednego : therefore he speak , and command that they should heat the furnace one seven time more than it be wont to be heat .
and he command the most mighty man that be in he army to bind shadrach , meshach , and abednego , and to cast they into the burning fiery furnace .
then these man be bind in they coat , they hose , and they hat , and they other garment , and be cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
therefore because the king 's commandment be urgent , and the furnace exceed hot , the flame of the fire slew those man that take up shadrach , meshach , and abednego .
and these three man , shadrach , meshach , and abednego , fall down bind into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then nebuchadnezzar the king be astony , and rise up in haste , and spake , and say unto he counsellor , do not we cast three man bind into the midst of the fire ?
they answer and say unto the king , true , o king .
he answer and say , lo , i see four man loose , walk in the midst of the fire , and they have no hurt ; and the form of the fourth be like the son of god .
then nebuchadnezzar come near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace , and spake , and say , shadrach , meshach , and abednego , ye servant of the most high god , come forth , and come hither .
then shadrach , meshach , and abednego , come forth of the midst of the fire .
and the prince , governor , and captain , and the king 's counsellor , be gather together , see these man , upon whose body the fire have no power , nor be a hair of they head singe , neither be they coat change , nor the smell of fire have pass on they .
then nebuchadnezzar spake , and say , blessed be the god of shadrach , meshach , and abednego , who have send he angel , and deliver he servant that trust in he , and have change the king 's word , and yield they body , that they might not serve nor worship any god , except they own god .
therefore i make a decree , that every people , nation , and language , which speak any thing amiss against the god of shadrach , meshach , and abednego , shall be cut in piece , and they house shall be make a dunghill : because there be no other god that can deliver after this sort .
then the king promote shadrach , meshach , and abednego , in the province of babylon .
nebuchadnezzar the king , unto all people , nation , and language , that dwell in all the earth ; peace be multiply unto you .
i think it good to shew the sign and wonder that the high god have work toward i .
how great be he sign ! and how mighty be he wonder ! he kingdom be a everlasting kingdom , and he dominion be from generation to generation .
i nebuchadnezzar be at rest in mine house , and flourish in my palace :
i see a dream which make i afraid , and the thought upon my bed and the vision of my head trouble i .
therefore make i a decree to bring in all the wise man of babylon before i , that they might make known unto i the interpretation of the dream .
then come in the magician , the astrologer , the chaldeans , and the soothsayer : and i tell the dream before they ; but they do not make known unto i the interpretation thereof .
but at the last daniel come in before i , whose name be belteshazzar , accord to the name of my god , and in whom be the spirit of the holy god : and before he i tell the dream , say ,
o belteshazzar , master of the magician , because i know that the spirit of the holy god be in thee , and no secret troubleth thee , tell i the vision of my dream that i have see , and the interpretation thereof .
thus be the vision of mine head in my bed ; i see , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof be great .
the tree grow , and be strong , and the height thereof reach unto heaven , and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth :
the leaf thereof be fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it be meat for all : the beast of the field have shadow under it , and the fowl of the heaven dwelt in the bough thereof , and all flesh be feed of it .
i see in the vision of my head upon my bed , and , behold , a watcher and a holy one come down from heaven ;
he cry aloud , and say thus , hew down the tree , and cut off he branch , shake off he leaf , and scatter he fruit : let the beast get away from under it , and the fowl from he branch :
nevertheless leave the stump of he root in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven , and let he portion be with the beast in the grass of the earth :
let he heart be change from man 's , and let a beast 's heart be give unto he ; and let seven time pass over he .
this matter be by the decree of the watcher , and the demand by the word of the holy one : to the intent that the living may know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of man , and giveth it to whomsoever he will , and setteth up over it the basest of man .
this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have see .
now thou , o belteshazzar , declare the interpretation thereof , forasmuch as all the wise man of my kingdom be not able to make known unto i the interpretation : but thou art able ; for the spirit of the holy god be in thee .
then daniel , whose name be belteshazzar , be astony for one hour , and he thought trouble he .
the king spake , and say , belteshazzar , let not the dream , or the interpretation thereof , trouble thee .
belteshazzar answer and say , my lord , the dream be to they that hate thee , and the interpretation thereof to thine enemy .
the tree that thou sawest , which grow , and be strong , whose height reach unto the heaven , and the sight thereof to all the earth ;
whose leaf be fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it be meat for all ; under which the beast of the field dwelt , and upon whose branch the fowl of the heaven have they habitation :
it be thou , o king , that art grow and become strong : for thy greatness be grow , and reacheth unto heaven , and thy dominion to the end of the earth .
and whereas the king see a watcher and a holy one come down from heaven , and say , hew the tree down , and destroy it ; yet leave the stump of the root thereof in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven , and let he portion be with the beast of the field , till seven time pass over he ;
this be the interpretation , o king , and this be the decree of the most high , which be come upon my lord the king :
that they shall drive thee from man , and thy dwelling shall be with the beast of the field , and they shall make thee to eat grass as ox , and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven , and seven time shall pass over thee , till thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of man , and giveth it to whomsoever he will .
and whereas they command to leave the stump of the tree root ; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee , after that thou shalt have know that the heaven do rule .
wherefore , o king , let my counsel be acceptable unto thee , and break off thy sin by righteousness , and thine iniquity by shew mercy to the poor ; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity .
all this come upon the king nebuchadnezzar .
at the end of twelve month he walk in the palace of the kingdom of babylon .
the king spake , and say , be not this great babylon , that i have build for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my majesty ?
while the word be in the king 's mouth , there fall a voice from heaven , say , o king nebuchadnezzar , to thee it be speak ; the kingdom be depart from thee .
and they shall drive thee from man , and thy dwelling shall be with the beast of the field : they shall make thee to eat grass as ox , and seven time shall pass over thee , until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of man , and giveth it to whomsoever he will .
the same hour be the thing fulfil upon nebuchadnezzar : and he be drive from man , and do eat grass as ox , and he body be wet with the dew of heaven , till he hair be grow like eagle ' feather , and he nail like bird ' claw .
and at the end of the day i nebuchadnezzar lift up mine eye unto heaven , and mine understanding return unto i , and i bless the most high , and i praise and honour he that liveth for ever , whose dominion be a everlasting dominion , and he kingdom be from generation to generation :
and all the inhabitant of the earth be repute as nothing : and he doeth accord to he will in the army of heaven , and among the inhabitant of the earth : and none can stay he hand , or say unto he , what doest thou ?
at the same time my reason return unto i ; and for the glory of my kingdom , mine honour and brightness return unto i ; and my counsellor and my lord seek unto i ; and i be establish in my kingdom , and excellent majesty be add unto i .
now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the king of heaven , all whose work be truth , and he way judgment : and those that walk in pride he be able to abase .
belshazzar the king make a great feast to a thousand of he lord , and drink wine before the thousand .
belshazzar , while he taste the wine , command to bring the golden and silver vessel which he father nebuchadnezzar have take out of the temple which be in jerusalem ; that the king , and he prince , he wife , and he concubine , might drink therein .
then they bring the golden vessel that be take out of the temple of the house of god which be at jerusalem ; and the king , and he prince , he wife , and he concubine , drink in they .
they drink wine , and praise the god of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
in the same hour come forth finger of a man 's hand , and write over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king see the part of the hand that write .
then the king 's countenance be change , and he thought trouble he , so that the joint of he loin be loose , and he knee smite one against another .
the king cry aloud to bring in the astrologer , the chaldeans , and the soothsayer .
and the king spake , and say to the wise man of babylon , whosoever shall read this writing , and shew i the interpretation thereof , shall be clothe with scarlet , and have a chain of gold about he neck , and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom .
then come in all the king 's wise man : but they could not read the writing , nor make know to the king the interpretation thereof .
then be king belshazzar greatly trouble , and he countenance be change in he , and he lord be astony .
now the queen by reason of the word of the king and he lord come into the banquet house : and the queen spake and say , o king , live for ever : let not thy thought trouble thee , nor let thy countenance be change :
there be a man in thy kingdom , in whom be the spirit of the holy god ; and in the day of thy father light and understanding and wisdom , like the wisdom of the god , be find in he ; whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father , the king , i say , thy father , make master of the magician , astrologer , chaldeans , and soothsayer ;
forasmuch as a excellent spirit , and knowledge , and understanding , interpret of dream , and shewing of hard sentence , and dissolve of doubt , be find in the same daniel , whom the king name belteshazzar : now let daniel be call , and he will shew the interpretation .
then be daniel bring in before the king .
and the king spake and say unto daniel , art thou that daniel , which art of the child of the captivity of judah , whom the king my father bring out of jewry ?
i have even hear of thee , that the spirit of the god be in thee , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom be find in thee .
and now the wise man , the astrologer , have be bring in before i , that they should read this writing , and make known unto i the interpretation thereof : but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing :
and i have hear of thee , that thou canst make interpretation , and dissolve doubt : now if thou canst read the writing , and make know to i the interpretation thereof , thou shalt be clothe with scarlet , and have a chain of gold about thy neck , and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom .
then daniel answer and say before the king , let thy gift be to thyself , and give thy reward to another ; yet i will read the write unto the king , and make know to he the interpretation .
o thou king , the most high god give nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom , and majesty , and glory , and honour :
and for the majesty that he give he , all people , nation , and language , tremble and fear before he : whom he would he slew ; and whom he would he keep alive ; and whom he would he set up ; and whom he would he put down .
but when he heart be lift up , and he mind harden in pride , he be depose from he kingly throne , and they take he glory from he :
and he be drive from the son of man ; and he heart be make like the beast , and he dwelling be with the wild ass : they feed he with grass like ox , and he body be wet with the dew of heaven ; till he know that the most high god rule in the kingdom of man , and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will .
and thou he son , o belshazzar , hast not humble thine heart , though thou knewest all this ;
but hast lift up thyself against the lord of heaven ; and they have bring the vessel of he house before thee , and thou , and thy lord , thy wife , and thy concubine , have drunk wine in they ; and thou hast praise the god of silver , and gold , of brass , iron , wood , and stone , which see not , nor hear , nor know : and the god in whose hand thy breath be , and whose be all thy way , hast thou not glorified :
then be the part of the hand send from he ; and this writing be write .
and this be the write that be write , mene , mene , tekel , upharsin .
this be the interpretation of the thing : mene ; god have number thy kingdom , and finish it .
tekel ; thou art weigh in the balance , and art find want .
pere ; thy kingdom be divide , and give to the medes and persians .
then command belshazzar , and they clothe daniel with scarlet , and put a chain of gold about he neck , and make a proclamation concern he , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
in that night be belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slay .
and darius the median take the kingdom , be about threescore and two year old .
it please darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty prince , which should be over the whole kingdom ;
and over these three president ; of whom daniel be first : that the prince might give account unto they , and the king should have no damage .
then this daniel be prefer above the president and prince , because a excellent spirit be in he ; and the king think to set he over the whole realm .
then the president and prince seek to find occasion against daniel concern the kingdom ; but they could find none occasion nor fault ; forasmuch as he be faithful , neither be there any error or fault find in he .
then say these man , we shall not find any occasion against this daniel , except we find it against he concern the law of he god .
then these president and prince assemble together to the king , and say thus unto he , king darius , live for ever .
all the president of the kingdom , the governor , and the prince , the counsellor , and the captain , have consult together to establish a royal statute , and to make a firm decree , that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty day , save of thee , o king , he shall be cast into the den of lion .
now , o king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it be not change , accord to the law of the medes and persians , which altereth not .
wherefore king darius sign the writing and the decree .
now when daniel know that the writing be sign , he go into he house ; and he window be open in he chamber toward jerusalem , he kneel upon he knee three time a day , and pray , and give thanks before he god , as he do aforetime .
then these man assemble , and find daniel pray and make supplication before he god .
then they come near , and spake before the king concern the king 's decree ; hast thou not sign a decree , that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty day , save of thee , o king , shall be cast into the den of lion ?
the king answer and say , the thing be true , accord to the law of the medes and persians , which altereth not .
then answer they and say before the king , that daniel , which be of the child of the captivity of judah , regardeth not thee , o king , nor the decree that thou hast sign , but maketh he petition three time a day .
then the king , when he hear these word , be sore displeased with himself , and set he heart on daniel to deliver he : and he labour till the go down of the sun to deliver he .
then these man assemble unto the king , and say unto the king , know , o king , that the law of the medes and persians be , that no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be change .
then the king command , and they bring daniel , and cast he into the den of lion .
now the king spake and say unto daniel , thy god whom thou servest continually , he will deliver thee .
and a stone be bring , and lay upon the mouth of the den ; and the king seal it with he own signet , and with the signet of he lord ; that the purpose might not be change concern daniel .
then the king go to he palace , and pass the night fasting : neither be instrument of musick bring before he : and he sleep go from he .
then the king arise very early in the morning , and go in haste unto the den of lion .
and when he come to the den , he cry with a lamentable voice unto daniel : and the king spake and say to daniel , o daniel , servant of the living god , be thy god , whom thou servest continually , able to deliver thee from the lion ?
then say daniel unto the king , o king , live for ever .
my god have send he angel , and have shut the lion ' mouth , that they have not hurt i : forasmuch as before he innocency be find in i ; and also before thee , o king , have i do no hurt .
then be the king exceed glad for he , and command that they should take daniel up out of the den .
so daniel be take up out of the den , and no manner of hurt be find upon he , because he believe in he god .
and the king command , and they bring those man which have accuse daniel , and they cast they into the den of lion , they , they child , and they wife ; and the lion have the mastery of they , and brake all they bone in piece or ever they come at the bottom of the den .
then king darius write unto all people , nation , and language , that dwell in all the earth ; peace be multiply unto you .
i make a decree , that in every dominion of my kingdom man tremble and fear before the god of daniel : for he be the living god , and stedfast for ever , and he kingdom that which shall not be destroy , and he dominion shall be even unto the end .
he delivereth and rescueth , and he worketh sign and wonder in heaven and in earth , who have deliver daniel from the power of the lion .
so this daniel prosper in the reign of darius , and in the reign of cyrus the persian .
in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel have a dream and vision of he head upon he bed : then he write the dream , and tell the sum of the matter .
daniel spake and say , i see in my vision by night , and , behold , the four wind of the heaven strove upon the great sea .
and four great beast come up from the sea , diverse one from another .
the first be like a lion , and have eagle 's wing : i behold till the wing thereof be pluck , and it be lift up from the earth , and make stand upon the foot as a man , and a man 's heart be give to it .
and behold another beast , a second , like to a bear , and it raise up itself on one side , and it have three rib in the mouth of it between the tooth of it : and they say thus unto it , arise , devour much flesh .
after this i behold , and lo another , like a leopard , which have upon the back of it four wing of a fowl ; the beast have also four head ; and dominion be give to it .
after this i see in the night vision , and behold a fourth beast , dreadful and terrible , and strong exceedingly ; and it have great iron tooth : it devour and brake in piece , and stamp the residue with the foot of it : and it be diverse from all the beast that be before it ; and it have ten horn .
i consider the horn , and , behold , there come up among they another little horn , before whom there be three of the first horn pluck up by the root : and , behold , in this horn be eye like the eye of man , and a mouth speak great thing .
i behold till the throne be cast down , and the ancient of day do sit , whose garment be white as snow , and the hair of he head like the pure wool : he throne be like the fiery flame , and he wheel as burn fire .
a fiery stream issue and come forth from before he : thousand thousand minister unto he , and ten thousand time ten thousand stand before he : the judgment be set , and the book be open .
i behold then because of the voice of the great word which the horn spake : i behold even till the beast be slay , and he body destroy , and give to the burning flame .
as concern the rest of the beast , they have they dominion take away : yet they life be prolong for a season and time .
i see in the night vision , and , behold , one like the son of man come with the cloud of heaven , and come to the ancient of day , and they bring he near before he .
and there be give he dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all people , nation , and language , should serve he : he dominion be a everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and he kingdom that which shall not be destroy .
i daniel be grieve in my spirit in the midst of my body , and the vision of my head trouble i .
i come near unto one of they that stand by , and ask he the truth of all this .
so he tell i , and make i know the interpretation of the thing .
these great beast , which be four , be four king , which shall arise out of the earth .
but the saint of the most high shall take the kingdom , and possess the kingdom for ever , even for ever and ever .
then i would know the truth of the fourth beast , which be diverse from all the other , exceed dreadful , whose tooth be of iron , and he nail of brass ; which devour , brake in piece , and stamp the residue with he foot ;
and of the ten horn that be in he head , and of the other which come up , and before whom three fall ; even of that horn that have eye , and a mouth that speak very great thing , whose look be more stout than he fellow .
i behold , and the same horn make war with the saint , and prevail against they ;
until the ancient of day come , and judgment be give to the saint of the most high ; and the time come that the saint possess the kingdom .
thus he say , the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be diverse from all kingdom , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in piece .
and the ten horn out of this kingdom be ten king that shall arise : and another shall rise after they ; and he shall be diverse from the first , and he shall subdue three king .
and he shall speak great word against the most high , and shall wear out the saint of the most high , and think to change time and law : and they shall be give into he hand until a time and time and the divide of time .
but the judgment shall sit , and they shall take away he dominion , to consume and to destroy it unto the end .
and the kingdom and dominion , and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven , shall be give to the people of the saint of the most high , whose kingdom be a everlasting kingdom , and all dominion shall serve and obey he .
hitherto be the end of the matter .
as for i daniel , my cogitation much trouble i , and my countenance change in i : but i keep the matter in my heart .
in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a vision appear unto i , even unto i daniel , after that which appear unto i at the first .
and i see in a vision ; and it come to pass , when i see , that i be at shushan in the palace , which be in the province of elam ; and i see in a vision , and i be by the river of ulai .
then i lift up mine eye , and see , and , behold , there stand before the river a ram which have two horn : and the two horn be high ; but one be higher than the other , and the higher come up last .
i see the ram push westward , and northward , and southward ; so that no beast might stand before he , neither be there any that could deliver out of he hand ; but he do accord to he will , and become great .
and as i be consider , behold , a he goat come from the west on the face of the whole earth , and touch not the ground : and the goat have a notable horn between he eye .
and he come to the ram that have two horn , which i have see standing before the river , and run unto he in the fury of he power .
and i see he come close unto the ram , and he be move with choler against he , and smite the ram , and brake he two horn : and there be no power in the ram to stand before he , but he cast he down to the ground , and stamp upon he : and there be none that could deliver the ram out of he hand .
therefore the he goat wax very great : and when he be strong , the great horn be break ; and for it come up four notable one toward the four wind of heaven .
and out of one of they come forth a little horn , which wax exceed great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the pleasant land .
and it wax great , even to the host of heaven ; and it cast down some of the host and of the star to the ground , and stamp upon they .
yea , he magnify himself even to the prince of the host , and by he the daily sacrifice be take away , and the place of he sanctuary be cast down .
and a host be give he against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practise , and prosper .
then i hear one saint speaking , and another saint say unto that certain saint which speak , how long shall be the vision concern the daily sacrifice , and the transgression of desolation , to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot ?
and he say unto i , unto two thousand and three hundred day ; then shall the sanctuary be cleanse .
and it come to pass , when i , even i daniel , have see the vision , and seek for the meaning , then , behold , there stand before i as the appearance of a man .
and i hear a man 's voice between the bank of ulai , which call , and say , gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
so he come near where i stand : and when he come , i be afraid , and fall upon my face : but he say unto i , understand , o son of man : for at the time of the end shall be the vision .
now as he be speak with i , i be in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground : but he touch i , and set i upright .
and he say , behold , i will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation : for at the time appoint the end shall be .
the ram which thou sawest have two horn be the king of media and persia .
and the rough goat be the king of grecia : and the great horn that be between he eye be the first king .
now that be break , whereas four stand up for it , four kingdom shall stand up out of the nation , but not in he power .
and in the latter time of they kingdom , when the transgressor be come to the full , a king of fierce countenance , and understand dark sentence , shall stand up .
and he power shall be mighty , but not by he own power : and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper , and practise , and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people .
and through he policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in he hand ; and he shall magnify himself in he heart , and by peace shall destroy many : he shall also stand up against the prince of prince ; but he shall be break without hand .
and the vision of the evening and the morning which be tell be true : wherefore shut thou up the vision ; for it shall be for many day .
and i daniel faint , and be sick certain day ; afterward i rise up , and do the king 's business ; and i be astonish at the vision , but none understand it .
in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus , of the seed of the medes , which be make king over the realm of the chaldeans ;
in the first year of he reign i daniel understand by book the number of the year , whereof the word of the lord come to jeremiah the prophet , that he would accomplish seventy year in the desolation of jerusalem .
and i set my face unto the lord god , to seek by prayer and supplication , with fasting , and sackcloth , and ash :
and i pray unto the lord my god , and make my confession , and say , o lord , the great and dreadful god , keep the covenant and mercy to they that love he , and to they that keep he commandment ;
we have sin , and have commit iniquity , and have do wickedly , and have rebel , even by depart from thy precept and from thy judgment :
neither have we hearken unto thy servant the prophet , which speak in thy name to we king , we prince , and we father , and to all the people of the land .
o lord , righteousness belongeth unto thee , but unto we confusion of face , as at this day ; to the man of judah , and to the inhabitant of jerusalem , and unto all israel , that be near , and that be far off , through all the country whither thou hast drive they , because of they trespass that they have trespass against thee .
o lord , to we belongeth confusion of face , to we king , to we prince , and to we father , because we have sin against thee .
to the lord we god belong mercy and forgiveness , though we have rebel against he ;
neither have we obey the voice of the lord we god , to walk in he law , which he set before we by he servant the prophet .
yea , all israel have transgress thy law , even by depart , that they might not obey thy voice ; therefore the curse be pour upon we , and the oath that be write in the law of moses the servant of god , because we have sin against he .
and he have confirm he word , which he speak against we , and against we judge that judge we , by bring upon we a great evil : for under the whole heaven have not be do as have be do upon jerusalem .
as it be write in the law of moses , all this evil be come upon we : yet make we not we prayer before the lord we god , that we might turn from we iniquity , and understand thy truth .
therefore have the lord watch upon the evil , and bring it upon we : for the lord we god be righteous in all he work which he doeth : for we obey not he voice .
and now , o lord we god , that hast bring thy people forth out of the land of egypt with a mighty hand , and hast get thee renown , as at this day ; we have sin , we have do wickedly .
o lord , accord to all thy righteousness , i beseech thee , let thine anger and thy fury be turn away from thy city jerusalem , thy holy mountain : because for we sin , and for the iniquity of we father , jerusalem and thy people be become a reproach to all that be about we .
now therefore , o we god , hear the prayer of thy servant , and he supplication , and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that be desolate , for the lord 's sake .
o my god , incline thine ear , and hear ; open thine eye , and behold we desolation , and the city which be call by thy name : for we do not present we supplication before thee for we righteousness , but for thy great mercy .
o lord , hear ; o lord , forgive ; o lord , hearken and do ; defer not , for thine own sake , o my god : for thy city and thy people be call by thy name .
and while i be speak , and pray , and confess my sin and the sin of my people israel , and present my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god ;
yea , while i be speak in prayer , even the man gabriel , whom i have see in the vision at the beginning , be cause to fly swiftly , touch i about the time of the evening oblation .
and he inform i , and talk with i , and say , o daniel , i be now come forth to give thee skill and understanding .
at the beginning of thy supplication the commandment come forth , and i be come to shew thee ; for thou art greatly beloved : therefore understand the matter , and consider the vision .
seventy week be determine upon thy people and upon thy holy city , to finish the transgression , and to make a end of sin , and to make reconciliation for iniquity , and to bring in everlasting righteousness , and to seal up the vision and prophecy , and to anoint the most holy .
know therefore and understand , that from the go forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the prince shall be seven week , and threescore and two week : the street shall be build again , and the wall , even in troublous time .
and after threescore and two week shall messiah be cut off , but not for himself : and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary ; and the end thereof shall be with a flood , and unto the end of the war desolation be determine .
and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week : and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease , and for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate , even until the consummation , and that determine shall be pour upon the desolate .
in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing be reveal unto daniel , whose name be call belteshazzar ; and the thing be true , but the time appoint be long : and he understand the thing , and have understanding of the vision .
in those day i daniel be mourn three full week .
i eat no pleasant bread , neither come flesh nor wine in my mouth , neither do i anoint myself at all , till three whole week be fulfil .
and in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as i be by the side of the great river , which be hiddekel ;
then i lift up mine eye , and look , and behold a certain man clothe in linen , whose loin be gird with fine gold of uphaz :
he body also be like the beryl , and he face as the appearance of lightning , and he eye as lamp of fire , and he arm and he foot like in colour to polish brass , and the voice of he word like the voice of a multitude .
and i daniel alone see the vision : for the man that be with i see not the vision ; but a great quaking fall upon they , so that they flee to hide themselves .
therefore i be leave alone , and see this great vision , and there remain no strength in i : for my comeliness be turn in i into corruption , and i retain no strength .
yet hear i the voice of he word : and when i hear the voice of he word , then be i in a deep sleep on my face , and my face toward the ground .
and , behold , a hand touch i , which set i upon my knee and upon the palm of my hand .
and he say unto i , o daniel , a man greatly beloved , understand the word that i speak unto thee , and stand upright : for unto thee be i now send .
and when he have speak this word unto i , i stand tremble .
then say he unto i , fear not , daniel : for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand , and to chasten thyself before thy god , thy word be hear , and i be come for thy word .
but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstand i one and twenty day : but , lo , michael , one of the chief prince , come to help i ; and i remain there with the king of persia .
now i be come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter day : for yet the vision be for many day .
and when he have speak such word unto i , i set my face toward the ground , and i become dumb .
and , behold , one like the similitude of the son of man touch my lip : then i open my mouth , and spake , and say unto he that stand before i , o my lord , by the vision my sorrow be turn upon i , and i have retain no strength .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for i , straightway there remain no strength in i , neither be there breath leave in i .
then there come again and touch i one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthen i ,
and say , o man greatly beloved , fear not : peace be unto thee , be strong , yea , be strong .
and when he have speak unto i , i be strengthen , and say , let my lord speak ; for thou hast strengthen i .
then say he , knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee ? and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia : and when i be go forth , lo , the prince of grecia shall come .
but i will shew thee that which be note in the scripture of truth : and there be none that holdeth with i in these thing , but michael you prince .
also i in the first year of darius the mede , even i , stand to confirm and to strengthen he .
and now will i shew thee the truth .
behold , there shall stand up yet three king in persia ; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all : and by he strength through he riches he shall stir up all against the realm of grecia .
and a mighty king shall stand up , that shall rule with great dominion , and do accord to he will .
and when he shall stand up , he kingdom shall be break , and shall be divide toward the four wind of heaven ; and not to he posterity , nor accord to he dominion which he rule : for he kingdom shall be pluck up , even for other beside those .
and the king of the south shall be strong , and one of he prince ; and he shall be strong above he , and have dominion ; he dominion shall be a great dominion .
and in the end of year they shall join themselves together ; for the king 's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make a agreement : but she shall not retain the power of the arm ; neither shall he stand , nor he arm : but she shall be give up , and they that bring she , and he that beget she , and he that strengthen she in these time .
but out of a branch of she root shall one stand up in he estate , which shall come with a army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against they , and shall prevail :
and shall also carry captive into egypt they god , with they prince , and with they precious vessel of silver and of gold ; and he shall continue more year than the king of the north .
so the king of the south shall come into he kingdom , and shall return into he own land .
but he son shall be stir up , and shall assemble a multitude of great force : and one shall certainly come , and overflow , and pass through : then shall he return , and be stir up , even to he fortress .
and the king of the south shall be move with choler , and shall come forth and fight with he , even with the king of the north : and he shall set forth a great multitude ; but the multitude shall be give into he hand .
and when he have take away the multitude , he heart shall be lift up ; and he shall cast down many ten thousand : but he shall not be strengthen by it .
for the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former , and shall certainly come after certain year with a great army and with much riches .
and in those time there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the robber of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
so the king of the north shall come , and cast up a mount , and take the most fenced city : and the arm of the south shall not withstand , neither he chosen people , neither shall there be any strength to withstand .
but he that cometh against he shall do accord to he own will , and none shall stand before he : and he shall stand in the glorious land , which by he hand shall be consume .
he shall also set he face to enter with the strength of he whole kingdom , and upright one with he ; thus shall he do : and he shall give he the daughter of woman , corrupt she : but she shall not stand on he side , neither be for he .
after this shall he turn he face unto the isle , and shall take many : but a prince for he own behalf shall cause the reproach offer by he to cease ; without he own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon he .
then he shall turn he face toward the fort of he own land : but he shall stumble and fall , and not be find .
then shall stand up in he estate a raiser of tax in the glory of the kingdom : but within few day he shall be destroy , neither in anger , nor in battle .
and in he estate shall stand up a vile person , to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom : but he shall come in peaceably , and obtain the kingdom by flattery .
and with the arm of a flood shall they be overfly from before he , and shall be break ; yea , also the prince of the covenant .
and after the league make with he he shall work deceitfully : for he shall come up , and shall become strong with a small people .
he shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest place of the province ; and he shall do that which he father have not do , nor he father ' father ; he shall scatter among they the prey , and spoil , and riches : yea , and he shall forecast he device against the strong hold , even for a time .
and he shall stir up he power and he courage against the king of the south with a great army ; and the king of the south shall be stir up to battle with a very great and mighty army ; but he shall not stand : for they shall forecast device against he .
yea , they that feed of the portion of he meat shall destroy he , and he army shall overflow : and many shall fall down slay .
and both these king ' heart shall be to do mischief , and they shall speak lie at one table ; but it shall not prosper : for yet the end shall be at the time appoint .
then shall he return into he land with great riches ; and he heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall do exploit , and return to he own land .
at the time appoint he shall return , and come toward the south ; but it shall not be as the former , or as the latter .
for the ship of chittim shall come against he : therefore he shall be grieve , and return , and have indignation against the holy covenant : so shall he do ; he shall even return , and have intelligence with they that forsake the holy covenant .
and arm shall stand on he part , and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength , and shall take away the daily sacrifice , and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate .
and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flattery : but the people that do know they god shall be strong , and do exploit .
and they that understand among the people shall instruct many : yet they shall fall by the sword , and by flame , by captivity , and by spoil , many day .
now when they shall fall , they shall be holpen with a little help : but many shall cleave to they with flattery .
and some of they of understand shall fall , to try they , and to purge , and to make they white , even to the time of the end : because it be yet for a time appoint .
and the king shall do accord to he will ; and he shall exalt himself , and magnify himself above every god , and shall speak marvellous thing against the god of god , and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplish : for that that be determine shall be do .
neither shall he regard the god of he father , nor the desire of woman , nor regard any god : for he shall magnify himself above all .
but in he estate shall he honour the god of force : and a god whom he father know not shall he honour with gold , and silver , and with precious stone , and pleasant thing .
thus shall he do in the most strong hold with a strange god , whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory : and he shall cause they to rule over many , and shall divide the land for gain .
and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at he : and the king of the north shall come against he like a whirlwind , with chariot , and with horseman , and with many ship ; and he shall enter into the country , and shall overflow and pass over .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many country shall be overthrow : but these shall escape out of he hand , even edom , and moab , and the chief of the child of ammon .
he shall stretch forth he hand also upon the country : and the land of egypt shall not escape .
but he shall have power over the treasure of gold and of silver , and over all the precious thing of egypt : and the libyans and the ethiopians shall be at he step .
but tiding out of the east and out of the north shall trouble he : therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy , and utterly to make away many .
and he shall plant the tabernacle of he palace between the sea in the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to he end , and none shall help he .
and at that time shall michael stand up , the great prince which standeth for the child of thy people : and there shall be a time of trouble , such as never be since there be a nation even to that same time : and at that time thy people shall be deliver , every one that shall be find write in the book .
and many of they that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the star for ever and ever .
but thou , o daniel , shut up the word , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increase .
then i daniel look , and , behold , there stand other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
and one say to the man clothe in linen , which be upon the water of the river , how long shall it be to the end of these wonder ?
and i hear the man clothe in linen , which be upon the water of the river , when he hold up he right hand and he left hand unto heaven , and sware by he that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time , time , and a half ; and when he shall have accomplish to scatter the power of the holy people , all these thing shall be finish .
and i hear , but i understand not : then say i , o my lord , what shall be the end of these thing ?
and he say , go thy way , daniel : for the word be close up and seal till the time of the end .
many shall be purify , and make white , and try ; but the wicked shall do wickedly : and none of the wicked shall understand ; but the wise shall understand .
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be take away , and the abomination that maketh desolate set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety day .
bless be he that waiteth , and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty day .
but go thou thy way till the end be : for thou shalt rest , and stand in thy lot at the end of the day .
the word of the lord that come unto hosea , the son of beeri , in the day of uzziah , jotham , ahaz , and hezekiah , king of judah , and in the day of jeroboam the son of joash , king of israel .
the beginning of the word of the lord by hosea .
and the lord say to hosea , go , take unto thee a wife of whoredom and child of whoredom : for the land have committed great whoredom , depart from the lord .
so he go and take gomer the daughter of diblaim ; which conceive , and bare he a son .
and the lord say unto he , call he name jezreel ; for yet a little while , and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house of jehu , and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of israel .
and it shall come to pass at that day , that i will break the bow of israel in the valley of jezreel .
and she conceive again , and bare a daughter .
and god say unto he , call she name loruhamah : for i will no more have mercy upon the house of israel ; but i will utterly take they away .
but i will have mercy upon the house of judah , and will save they by the lord they god , and will not save they by bow , nor by sword , nor by battle , by horse , nor by horseman .
now when she have wean loruhamah , she conceive , and bare a son .
then say god , call he name loammi : for ye be not my people , and i will not be you god .
yet the number of the child of israel shall be as the sand of the sea , which can not be measure nor number ; and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it be say unto they , ye be not my people , there it shall be say unto they , ye be the son of the living god .
then shall the child of judah and the child of israel be gather together , and appoint themselves one head , and they shall come up out of the land : for great shall be the day of jezreel .
say ye unto you brethren , ammi ; and to you sister , ruhamah .
plead with you mother , plead : for she be not my wife , neither be i she husband : let she therefore put away she whoredom out of she sight , and she adultery from between she breast ;
lest i strip she naked , and set she as in the day that she be bear , and make she as a wilderness , and set she like a dry land , and slay she with thirst .
and i will not have mercy upon she child ; for they be the child of whoredom .
for they mother have play the harlot : she that conceive they have do shamefully : for she say , i will go after my lover , that give i my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , mine oil and my drink .
therefore , behold , i will hedge up thy way with thorn , and make a wall , that she shall not find she path .
and she shall follow after she lover , but she shall not overtake they ; and she shall seek they , but shall not find they : then shall she say , i will go and return to my first husband ; for then be it better with i than now .
for she do not know that i give she corn , and wine , and oil , and multiply she silver and gold , which they prepare for baal .
therefore will i return , and take away my corn in the time thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and will recover my wool and my flax give to cover she nakedness .
and now will i discover she lewdness in the sight of she lover , and none shall deliver she out of mine hand .
i will also cause all she mirth to cease , she feast day , she new moon , and she sabbath , and all she solemn feast .
and i will destroy she vine and she fig tree , whereof she have say , these be my reward that my lover have give i : and i will make they a forest , and the beast of the field shall eat they .
and i will visit upon she the day of baalim , wherein she burn incense to they , and she deck herself with she earring and she jewel , and she go after she lover , and forgat i , saith the lord .
therefore , behold , i will allure she , and bring she into the wilderness , and speak comfortably unto she .
and i will give she she vineyard from thence , and the valley of achor for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the day of she youth , and as in the day when she come up out of the land of egypt .
and it shall be at that day , saith the lord , that thou shalt call i ishi ; and shalt call i no more baali .
for i will take away the name of baalim out of she mouth , and they shall no more be remember by they name .
and in that day will i make a covenant for they with the beast of the field , and with the fowl of heaven , and with the creep thing of the ground : and i will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth , and will make they to lie down safely .
and i will betroth thee unto i for ever ; yea , i will betroth thee unto i in righteousness , and in judgment , and in lovingkindness , and in mercy .
i will even betroth thee unto i in faithfulness : and thou shalt know the lord .
and it shall come to pass in that day , i will hear , saith the lord , i will hear the heaven , and they shall hear the earth ;
and the earth shall hear the corn , and the wine , and the oil ; and they shall hear jezreel .
and i will sow she unto i in the earth ; and i will have mercy upon she that have not obtain mercy ; and i will say to they which be not my people , thou art my people ; and they shall say , thou art my god .
then say the lord unto i , go yet , love a woman beloved of she friend , yet a adulteress , accord to the love of the lord toward the child of israel , who look to other god , and love flagon of wine .
so i buy she to i for fifteen piece of silver , and for a homer of barley , and a half homer of barley :
and i say unto she , thou shalt abide for i many day ; thou shalt not play the harlot , and thou shalt not be for another man : so will i also be for thee .
for the child of israel shall abide many day without a king , and without a prince , and without a sacrifice , and without a image , and without a ephod , and without teraphim :
afterward shall the child of israel return , and seek the lord they god , and david they king ; and shall fear the lord and he goodness in the latter day .
hear the word of the lord , ye child of israel : for the lord have a controversy with the inhabitant of the land , because there be no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of god in the land .
by swearing , and lie , and killing , and steal , and commit adultery , they break out , and blood toucheth blood .
therefore shall the land mourn , and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish , with the beast of the field , and with the fowl of heaven ; yea , the fish of the sea also shall be take away .
yet let no man strive , nor reprove another : for thy people be as they that strive with the priest .
therefore shalt thou fall in the day , and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night , and i will destroy thy mother .
my people be destroy for lack of knowledge : because thou hast reject knowledge , i will also reject thee , that thou shalt be no priest to i : see thou hast forget the law of thy god , i will also forget thy child .
as they be increase , so they sin against i : therefore will i change they glory into shame .
they eat up the sin of my people , and they set they heart on they iniquity .
and there shall be , like people , like priest : and i will punish they for they way , and reward they they doings .
for they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit whoredom , and shall not increase : because they have leave off to take heed to the lord .
whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart .
my people ask counsel at they stock , and they staff declareth unto they : for the spirit of whoredom have cause they to err , and they have go a whoring from under they god .
they sacrifice upon the top of the mountain , and burn incense upon the hill , under oak and poplar and elm , because the shadow thereof be good : therefore you daughter shall commit whoredom , and you spouse shall commit adultery .
i will not punish you daughter when they commit whoredom , nor you spouse when they commit adultery : for themselves be separate with whore , and they sacrifice with harlot : therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall .
though thou , israel , play the harlot , yet let not judah offend ; and come not ye unto gilgal , neither go ye up to bethaven , nor swear , the lord liveth .
for israel slideth back as a backslide heifer : now the lord will feed they as a lamb in a large place .
ephraim be join to idol : let he alone .
they drink be sour : they have commit whoredom continually : she ruler with shame do love , give ye .
the wind have bind she up in she wing , and they shall be ashamed because of they sacrifice .
hear ye this , o priest ; and hearken , ye house of israel ; and give ye ear , o house of the king ; for judgment be toward you , because ye have be a snare on mizpah , and a net spread upon tabor .
and the revolter be profound to make slaughter , though i have be a rebuker of they all .
i know ephraim , and israel be not hide from i : for now , o ephraim , thou committest whoredom , and israel be defile .
they will not frame they doings to turn unto they god : for the spirit of whoredom be in the midst of they , and they have not know the lord .
and the pride of israel doth testify to he face : therefore shall israel and ephraim fall in they iniquity ; judah also shall fall with they .
they shall go with they flock and with they herd to seek the lord ; but they shall not find he ; he have withdraw himself from they .
they have deal treacherously against the lord : for they have beget strange child : now shall a month devour they with they portion .
blow ye the cornet in gibeah , and the trumpet in ramah : cry aloud at bethaven , after thee , o benjamin .
ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke : among the tribe of israel have i make know that which shall surely be .
the prince of judah be like they that remove the bind : therefore i will pour out my wrath upon they like water .
ephraim be oppress and break in judgment , because he willingly walk after the commandment .
therefore will i be unto ephraim as a moth , and to the house of judah as rottenness .
when ephraim see he sickness , and judah see he wound , then go ephraim to the assyrian , and send to king jareb : yet could he not heal you , nor cure you of you wound .
for i will be unto ephraim as a lion , and as a young lion to the house of judah : i , even i , will tear and go away ; i will take away , and none shall rescue he .
i will go and return to my place , till they acknowledge they offence , and seek my face : in they affliction they will seek i early .
come , and let we return unto the lord : for he have tear , and he will heal we ; he have smitten , and he will bind we up .
after two day will he revive we : in the third day he will raise we up , and we shall live in he sight .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the lord : he go forth be prepare as the morning ; and he shall come unto we as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
o ephraim , what shall i do unto thee ?
o judah , what shall i do unto thee ? for you goodness be as a morning cloud , and as the early dew it goeth away .
therefore have i hew they by the prophet ; i have slay they by the word of my mouth : and thy judgment be as the light that goeth forth .
for i desire mercy , and not sacrifice ; and the knowledge of god more than burnt offering .
but they like man have transgress the covenant : there have they deal treacherously against i .
gilead be a city of they that work iniquity , and be polluted with blood .
and as troops of robber wait for a man , so the company of priest murder in the way by consent : for they commit lewdness .
i have see a horrible thing in the house of israel : there be the whoredom of ephraim , israel be defile .
also , o judah , he have set a harvest for thee , when i return the captivity of my people .
when i would have heal israel , then the iniquity of ephraim be discover , and the wickedness of samaria : for they commit falsehood ; and the thief cometh in , and the troop of robber spoileth without .
and they consider not in they heart that i remember all they wickedness : now they own doings have beset they about ; they be before my face .
they make the king glad with they wickedness , and the prince with they lie .
they be all adulterer , as a oven heat by the baker , who ceaseth from raise after he have knead the dough , until it be leaven .
in the day of we king the prince have make he sick with bottle of wine ; he stretch out he hand with scorner .
for they have make ready they heart like a oven , while they lie in wait : they baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire .
they be all hot as a oven , and have devour they judge ; all they king be fall : there be none among they that calleth unto i .
ephraim , he have mixed himself among the people ; ephraim be a cake not turn .
stranger have devour he strength , and he knoweth it not : yea , gray hair be here and there upon he , yet he knoweth not .
and the pride of israel testifieth to he face : and they do not return to the lord they god , nor seek he for all this .
ephraim also be like a silly dive without heart : they call to egypt , they go to assyria .
when they shall go , i will spread my net upon they ; i will bring they down as the fowl of the heaven ; i will chastise they , as they congregation have hear .
woe unto they ! for they have flee from i : destruction unto they ! because they have transgress against i : though i have redeem they , yet they have speak lie against i .
and they have not cry unto i with they heart , when they howl upon they bed : they assemble themselves for corn and wine , and they rebel against i .
though i have bind and strengthen they arm , yet do they imagine mischief against i .
they return , but not to the most high : they be like a deceitful bow : they prince shall fall by the sword for the rage of they tongue : this shall be they derision in the land of egypt .
set the trumpet to thy mouth .
he shall come as a eagle against the house of the lord , because they have transgress my covenant , and trespass against my law .
israel shall cry unto i , my god , we know thee .
israel have cast off the thing that be good : the enemy shall pursue he .
they have set up king , but not by i : they have make prince , and i know it not : of they silver and they gold have they make they idol , that they may be cut off .
thy calf , o samaria , have cast thee off ; mine anger be kindle against they : how long will it be ere they attain to innocency ?
for from israel be it also : the workman make it ; therefore it be not god : but the calf of samaria shall be break in piece .
for they have sow the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind : it have no stalk : the bud shall yield no meal : if so be it yield , the stranger shall swallow it up .
israel be swallow up : now shall they be among the gentiles as a vessel wherein be no pleasure .
for they be go up to assyria , a wild ass alone by himself : ephraim have hire lover .
yea , though they have hire among the nation , now will i gather they , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of prince .
because ephraim have make many altar to sin , altar shall be unto he to sin .
i have write to he the great thing of my law , but they be count as a strange thing .
they sacrifice flesh for the sacrifice of mine offering , and eat it ; but the lord accepteth they not ; now will he remember they iniquity , and visit they sin : they shall return to egypt .
for israel have forget he maker , and buildeth temple ; and judah have multiply fenced city : but i will send a fire upon he city , and it shall devour the palace thereof .
rejoice not , o israel , for joy , as other people : for thou hast go a whoring from thy god , thou hast love a reward upon every cornfloor .
the floor and the winepress shall not feed they , and the new wine shall fail in she .
they shall not dwell in the lord 's land ; but ephraim shall return to egypt , and they shall eat unclean thing in assyria .
they shall not offer wine offering to the lord , neither shall they be please unto he : they sacrifice shall be unto they as the bread of mourner ; all that eat thereof shall be polluted : for they bread for they soul shall not come into the house of the lord .
what will ye do in the solemn day , and in the day of the feast of the lord ?
for , lo , they be go because of destruction : egypt shall gather they up , memphis shall bury they : the pleasant place for they silver , nettle shall possess they : thorn shall be in they tabernacle .
the day of visitation be come , the day of recompence be come ; israel shall know it : the prophet be a fool , the spiritual man be mad , for the multitude of thine iniquity , and the great hatred .
the watchman of ephraim be with my god : but the prophet be a snare of a fowler in all he way , and hatred in the house of he god .
they have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the day of gibeah : therefore he will remember they iniquity , he will visit they sin .
i find israel like grape in the wilderness ; i see you father as the firstripe in the fig tree at she first time : but they go to baalpeor , and separated themselves unto that shame ; and they abomination be accord as they love .
as for ephraim , they glory shall fly away like a bird , from the birth , and from the womb , and from the conception .
though they bring up they child , yet will i bereave they , that there shall not be a man leave : yea , woe also to they when i depart from they !
ephraim , as i see tyrus , be plant in a pleasant place : but ephraim shall bring forth he child to the murderer .
give they , o lord : what wilt thou give ? give they a miscarry womb and dry breast .
all they wickedness be in gilgal : for there i hate they : for the wickedness of they doings i will drive they out of mine house , i will love they no more : all they prince be revolter .
ephraim be smitten , they root be dry up , they shall bear no fruit : yea , though they bring forth , yet will i slay even the beloved fruit of they womb .
my god will cast they away , because they do not hearken unto he : and they shall be wanderer among the nation .
israel be a empty vine , he bringeth forth fruit unto himself : accord to the multitude of he fruit he have increase the altar ; accord to the goodness of he land they have make goodly image .
they heart be divide ; now shall they be find faulty : he shall break down they altar , he shall spoil they image .
for now they shall say , we have no king , because we fear not the lord ; what then should a king do to we ?
they have speak word , swearing falsely in make a covenant : thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrow of the field .
the inhabitant of samaria shall fear because of the calf of bethaven : for the people thereof shall mourn over it , and the priest thereof that rejoice on it , for the glory thereof , because it be depart from it .
it shall be also carry unto assyria for a present to king jareb : ephraim shall receive shame , and israel shall be ashamed of he own counsel .
as for samaria , she king be cut off as the foam upon the water .
the high place also of aven , the sin of israel , shall be destroy : the thorn and the thistle shall come up on they altar ; and they shall say to the mountain , cover we ; and to the hill , fall on we .
o israel , thou hast sin from the day of gibeah : there they stand : the battle in gibeah against the child of iniquity do not overtake they .
it be in my desire that i should chastise they ; and the people shall be gather against they , when they shall bind themselves in they two furrow .
and ephraim be as a heifer that be teach , and loveth to tread out the corn ; but i pass over upon she fair neck : i will make ephraim to ride ; judah shall plow , and jacob shall break he clod .
sow to yourselve in righteousness , reap in mercy ; break up you fallow ground : for it be time to seek the lord , till he come and rain righteousness upon you .
ye have plow wickedness , ye have reap iniquity ; ye have eat the fruit of lie : because thou didst trust in thy way , in the multitude of thy mighty man .
therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people , and all thy fortress shall be spoil , as shalman spoil betharbel in the day of battle : the mother be dash in piece upon she child .
so shall bethel do unto you because of you great wickedness : in a morning shall the king of israel utterly be cut off .
when israel be a child , then i love he , and call my son out of egypt .
as they call they , so they go from they : they sacrifice unto baalim , and burn incense to grave image .
i teach ephraim also to go , take they by they arm ; but they know not that i heal they .
i draw they with cord of a man , with band of love : and i be to they as they that take off the yoke on they jaw , and i lay meat unto they .
he shall not return into the land of egypt , but the assyrian shall be he king , because they refuse to return .
and the sword shall abide on he city , and shall consume he branch , and devour they , because of they own counsel .
and my people be bent to backslide from i : though they call they to the most high , none at all would exalt he .
how shall i give thee up , ephraim ? how shall i deliver thee , israel ? how shall i make thee as admah ? how shall i set thee as zeboim ? mine heart be turn within i , my repenting be kindle together .
i will not execute the fierceness of mine anger , i will not return to destroy ephraim : for i be god , and not man ; the holy one in the midst of thee : and i will not enter into the city .
they shall walk after the lord : he shall roar like a lion : when he shall roar , then the child shall tremble from the west .
they shall tremble as a bird out of egypt , and as a dive out of the land of assyria : and i will place they in they house , saith the lord .
ephraim compasseth i about with lie , and the house of israel with deceit : but judah yet ruleth with god , and be faithful with the saint .
ephraim feedeth on wind , and followeth after the east wind : he daily increaseth lie and desolation ; and they do make a covenant with the assyrians , and oil be carry into egypt .
the lord have also a controversy with judah , and will punish jacob accord to he way ; accord to he doings will he recompense he .
he take he brother by the heel in the womb , and by he strength he have power with god :
yea , he have power over the angel , and prevail : he weep , and make supplication unto he : he find he in bethel , and there he speak with we ;
even the lord god of host ; the lord be he memorial .
therefore turn thou to thy god : keep mercy and judgment , and wait on thy god continually .
he be a merchant , the balance of deceit be in he hand : he loveth to oppress .
and ephraim say , yet i be become rich , i have find i out substance : in all my labour they shall find none iniquity in i that be sin .
and i that be the lord thy god from the land of egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacle , as in the day of the solemn feast .
i have also speak by the prophet , and i have multiply vision , and use similitude , by the ministry of the prophet .
be there iniquity in gilead ? surely they be vanity : they sacrifice bullock in gilgal ; yea , they altar be as heap in the furrow of the field .
and jacob flee into the country of syria , and israel serve for a wife , and for a wife he keep sheep .
and by a prophet the lord bring israel out of egypt , and by a prophet be he preserve .
ephraim provoke he to anger most bitterly : therefore shall he leave he blood upon he , and he reproach shall he lord return unto he .
when ephraim speak tremble , he exalt himself in israel ; but when he offend in baal , he die .
and now they sin more and more , and have make they molten image of they silver , and idol accord to they own understanding , all of it the work of the craftsman : they say of they , let the man that sacrifice kiss the calf .
therefore they shall be as the morning cloud , and as the early dew that passeth away , as the chaff that be drive with the whirlwind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the chimney .
yet i be the lord thy god from the land of egypt , and thou shalt know no god but i : for there be no saviour beside i .
i do know thee in the wilderness , in the land of great drought .
accord to they pasture , so be they fill ; they be fill , and they heart be exalt ; therefore have they forget i .
therefore i will be unto they as a lion : as a leopard by the way will i observe they :
i will meet they as a bear that be bereave of she whelp , and will rend the caul of they heart , and there will i devour they like a lion : the wild beast shall tear they .
o israel , thou hast destroy thyself ; but in i be thine help .
i will be thy king : where be any other that may save thee in all thy city ? and thy judge of whom thou saidst , give i a king and prince ?
i give thee a king in mine anger , and take he away in my wrath .
the iniquity of ephraim be bind up ; he sin be hide .
the sorrow of a travailing woman shall come upon he : he be a unwise son ; for he should not stay long in the place of the break forth of child .
i will ransom they from the power of the grave ; i will redeem they from death : o death , i will be thy plague ; o grave , i will be thy destruction : repentance shall be hide from mine eye .
though he be fruitful among he brethren , a east wind shall come , the wind of the lord shall come up from the wilderness , and he spring shall become dry , and he fountain shall be dry up : he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessel .
samaria shall become desolate ; for she have rebel against she god : they shall fall by the sword : they infant shall be dash in piece , and they woman with child shall be rip up .
o israel , return unto the lord thy god ; for thou hast fall by thine iniquity .
take with you word , and turn to the lord : say unto he , take away all iniquity , and receive we graciously : so will we render the calf of we lip .
asshur shall not save we ; we will not ride upon horse : neither will we say any more to the work of we hand , ye be we god : for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy .
i will heal they backsliding , i will love they freely : for mine anger be turn away from he .
i will be as the dew unto israel : he shall grow as the lily , and cast forth he root as lebanon .
he branch shall spread , and he beauty shall be as the olive tree , and he smell as lebanon .
they that dwell under he shadow shall return ; they shall revive as the corn , and grow as the vine : the scent thereof shall be as the wine of lebanon .
ephraim shall say , what have i to do any more with idol ?
i have hear he , and observe he : i be like a green fir tree .
from i be thy fruit find .
who be wise , and he shall understand these thing ? prudent , and he shall know they ? for the way of the lord be right , and the just shall walk in they : but the transgressor shall fall therein .
the word of the lord that come to joel the son of pethuel .
hear this , ye old man , and give ear , all ye inhabitant of the land .
hath this be in you day , or even in the day of you father ?
tell ye you child of it , and let you child tell they child , and they child another generation .
that which the palmerworm have left have the locust eat ; and that which the locust have left have the cankerworm eat ; and that which the cankerworm have left have the caterpiller eat .
awake , ye drunkard , and weep ; and howl , all ye drinker of wine , because of the new wine ; for it be cut off from you mouth .
for a nation be come up upon my land , strong , and without number , whose tooth be the tooth of a lion , and he have the cheek tooth of a great lion .
he have lay my vine waste , and bark my fig tree : he have make it clean bare , and cast it away ; the branch thereof be make white .
lament like a virgin gird with sackcloth for the husband of she youth .
the meat offering and the drink offering be cut off from the house of the lord ; the priest , the lord 's minister , mourn .
the field be waste , the land mourneth ; for the corn be waste : the new wine be dry up , the oil languisheth .
be ye ashamed , o ye husbandman ; howl , o ye vinedresser , for the wheat and for the barley ; because the harvest of the field be perish .
the vine be dry up , and the fig tree languisheth ; the pomegranate tree , the palm tree also , and the apple tree , even all the tree of the field , be wither : because joy be wither away from the son of man .
gird yourselve , and lament , ye priest : howl , ye minister of the altar : come , lie all night in sackcloth , ye minister of my god : for the meat offering and the drink offering be withholden from the house of you god .
sanctify ye a fast , call a solemn assembly , gather the elder and all the inhabitant of the land into the house of the lord you god , and cry unto the lord .
alas for the day ! for the day of the lord be at hand , and as a destruction from the almighty shall it come .
be not the meat cut off before we eye , yea , joy and gladness from the house of we god ?
the seed be rotten under they clod , the garner be lay desolate , the barn be break down ; for the corn be wither .
how do the beast groan ! the herd of cattle be perplexed , because they have no pasture ; yea , the flock of sheep be make desolate .
o lord , to thee will i cry : for the fire have devour the pasture of the wilderness , and the flame have burn all the tree of the field .
the beast of the field cry also unto thee : for the river of water be dry up , and the fire have devour the pasture of the wilderness .
blow ye the trumpet in zion , and sound a alarm in my holy mountain : let all the inhabitant of the land tremble : for the day of the lord cometh , for it be nigh at hand ;
a day of darkness and of gloominess , a day of cloud and of thick darkness , as the morning spread upon the mountain : a great people and a strong ; there have not be ever the like , neither shall be any more after it , even to the year of many generation .
a fire devoureth before they ; and behind they a flame burneth : the land be as the garden of eden before they , and behind they a desolate wilderness ; yea , and nothing shall escape they .
the appearance of they be as the appearance of horse ; and as horseman , so shall they run .
like the noise of chariot on the top of mountain shall they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
before they face the people shall be much pained : all face shall gather blackness .
they shall run like mighty man ; they shall climb the wall like man of war ; and they shall march every one on he way , and they shall not break they rank :
neither shall one thrust another ; they shall walk every one in he path : and when they fall upon the sword , they shall not be wound .
they shall run to and fro in the city ; they shall run upon the wall , they shall climb up upon the house ; they shall enter in at the window like a thief .
the earth shall quake before they ; the heaven shall tremble : the sun and the moon shall be dark , and the star shall withdraw they shine :
and the lord shall utter he voice before he army : for he camp be very great : for he be strong that executeth he word : for the day of the lord be great and very terrible ; and who can abide it ?
therefore also now , saith the lord , turn ye even to i with all you heart , and with fasting , and with weep , and with mourning :
and rend you heart , and not you garment , and turn unto the lord you god : for he be gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repenteth he of the evil .
who knoweth if he will return and repent , and leave a blessing behind he ; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the lord you god ?
blow the trumpet in zion , sanctify a fast , call a solemn assembly :
gather the people , sanctify the congregation , assemble the elder , gather the child , and those that suck the breast : let the bridegroom go forth of he chamber , and the bride out of she closet .
let the priest , the minister of the lord , weep between the porch and the altar , and let they say , spare thy people , o lord , and give not thine heritage to reproach , that the heathen should rule over they : wherefore should they say among the people , where be they god ?
then will the lord be jealous for he land , and pity he people .
yea , the lord will answer and say unto he people , behold , i will send you corn , and wine , and oil , and ye shall be satisfied therewith : and i will no more make you a reproach among the heathen :
but i will remove far off from you the northern army , and will drive he into a land barren and desolate , with he face toward the east sea , and he hinder part toward the utmost sea , and he stink shall come up , and he ill savour shall come up , because he have do great thing .
fear not , o land ; be glad and rejoice : for the lord will do great thing .
be not afraid , ye beast of the field : for the pasture of the wilderness do spring , for the tree beareth she fruit , the fig tree and the vine do yield they strength .
be glad then , ye child of zion , and rejoice in the lord you god : for he have give you the former rain moderately , and he will cause to come down for you the rain , the former rain , and the latter rain in the first month .
and the floor shall be full of wheat , and the vat shall overflow with wine and oil .
and i will restore to you the year that the locust have eat , the cankerworm , and the caterpiller , and the palmerworm , my great army which i send among you .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfy , and praise the name of the lord you god , that have deal wondrously with you : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and ye shall know that i be in the midst of israel , and that i be the lord you god , and none else : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and it shall come to pass afterward , that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and you son and you daughter shall prophesy , you old man shall dream dream , you young man shall see vision :
and also upon the servant and upon the handmaid in those day will i pour out my spirit .
and i will shew wonder in the heaven and in the earth , blood , and fire , and pillar of smoke .
the sun shall be turn into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the lord come .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be deliver : for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance , as the lord have say , and in the remnant whom the lord shall call .
for , behold , in those day , and in that time , when i shall bring again the captivity of judah and jerusalem ,
i will also gather all nation , and will bring they down into the valley of jehoshaphat , and will plead with they there for my people and for my heritage israel , whom they have scatter among the nation , and part my land .
and they have cast lot for my people ; and have give a boy for a harlot , and sell a girl for wine , that they might drink .
yea , and what have ye to do with i , o tyre , and zidon , and all the coast of palestine ? will ye render i a recompence ? and if ye recompense i , swiftly and speedily will i return you recompence upon you own head ;
because ye have take my silver and my gold , and have carry into you temple my goodly pleasant thing :
the child also of judah and the child of jerusalem have ye sell unto the grecians , that ye might remove they far from they border .
behold , i will raise they out of the place whither ye have sell they , and will return you recompence upon you own head :
and i will sell you son and you daughter into the hand of the child of judah , and they shall sell they to the sabeans , to a people far off : for the lord have speak it .
proclaim ye this among the gentiles ; prepare war , wake up the mighty man , let all the man of war draw near ; let they come up :
beat you plowshare into sword , and you pruninghook into spear : let the weak say , i be strong .
assemble yourselve , and come , all ye heathen , and gather yourselve together round about : thither cause thy mighty one to come down , o lord .
let the heathen be waken , and come up to the valley of jehoshaphat : for there will i sit to judge all the heathen round about .
put ye in the sickle , for the harvest be ripe : come , get you down ; for the press be full , the fat overflow ; for they wickedness be great .
multitude , multitude in the valley of decision : for the day of the lord be near in the valley of decision .
the sun and the moon shall be darken , and the star shall withdraw they shine .
the lord also shall roar out of zion , and utter he voice from jerusalem ; and the heaven and the earth shall shake : but the lord will be the hope of he people , and the strength of the child of israel .
so shall ye know that i be the lord you god dwelling in zion , my holy mountain : then shall jerusalem be holy , and there shall no stranger pass through she any more .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the mountain shall drop down new wine , and the hill shall flow with milk , and all the river of judah shall flow with water , and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the lord , and shall water the valley of shittim .
egypt shall be a desolation , and edom shall be a desolate wilderness , for the violence against the child of judah , because they have shed innocent blood in they land .
but judah shall dwell for ever , and jerusalem from generation to generation .
for i will cleanse they blood that i have not cleanse : for the lord dwelleth in zion .
the word of amos , who be among the herdman of tekoa , which he see concern israel in the day of uzziah king of judah , and in the day of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel , two year before the earthquake .
and he say , the lord will roar from zion , and utter he voice from jerusalem ; and the habitation of the shepherd shall mourn , and the top of carmel shall wither .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgression of damascus , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have thresh gilead with threshing instrument of iron :
but i will send a fire into the house of hazael , which shall devour the palace of benhadad .
i will break also the bar of damascus , and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of aven , and he that holdeth the sceptre from the house of eden : and the people of syria shall go into captivity unto kir , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgression of gaza , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they carry away captive the whole captivity , to deliver they up to edom :
but i will send a fire on the wall of gaza , which shall devour the palace thereof :
and i will cut off the inhabitant from ashdod , and he that holdeth the sceptre from ashkelon , and i will turn mine hand against ekron : and the remnant of the philistines shall perish , saith the lord god .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgression of tyrus , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they deliver up the whole captivity to edom , and remember not the brotherly covenant :
but i will send a fire on the wall of tyrus , which shall devour the palace thereof .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgression of edom , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he do pursue he brother with the sword , and do cast off all pity , and he anger do tear perpetually , and he keep he wrath for ever :
but i will send a fire upon teman , which shall devour the palace of bozrah .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgression of the child of ammon , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have rip up the woman with child of gilead , that they might enlarge they border :
but i will kindle a fire in the wall of rabbah , and it shall devour the palace thereof , with shout in the day of battle , with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind :
and they king shall go into captivity , he and he prince together , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgression of moab , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he burn the bone of the king of edom into lime :
but i will send a fire upon moab , and it shall devour the palace of kirioth : and moab shall die with tumult , with shout , and with the sound of the trumpet :
and i will cut off the judge from the midst thereof , and will slay all the prince thereof with he , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgression of judah , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have despise the law of the lord , and have not keep he commandment , and they lie cause they to err , after the which they father have walk :
but i will send a fire upon judah , and it shall devour the palace of jerusalem .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgression of israel , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sell the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoe ;
that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the meek : and a man and he father will go in unto the same maid , to profane my holy name :
and they lay themselves down upon clothes lay to pledge by every altar , and they drink the wine of the condemn in the house of they god .
yet destroy i the amorite before they , whose height be like the height of the cedar , and he be strong as the oak ; yet i destroy he fruit from above , and he root from beneath .
also i bring you up from the land of egypt , and lead you forty year through the wilderness , to possess the land of the amorite .
and i raise up of you son for prophet , and of you young man for nazarite .
be it not even thus , o ye child of israel ? saith the lord .
but ye give the nazarites wine to drink ; and command the prophet , say , prophesy not .
behold , i be press under you , as a cart be press that be full of sheaf .
therefore the flight shall perish from the swift , and the strong shall not strengthen he force , neither shall the mighty deliver himself :
neither shall he stand that handleth the bow ; and he that be swift of foot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself .
and he that be courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day , saith the lord .
hear this word that the lord have speak against you , o child of israel , against the whole family which i bring up from the land of egypt , say ,
you only have i know of all the family of the earth : therefore i will punish you for all you iniquity .
can two walk together , except they be agree ?
will a lion roar in the forest , when he have no prey ? will a young lion cry out of he den , if he have take nothing ?
can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth , where no gin be for he ? shall one take up a snare from the earth , and have take nothing at all ?
shall a trumpet be blow in the city , and the people not be afraid ? shall there be evil in a city , and the lord have not do it ?
surely the lord god will do nothing , but he revealeth he secret unto he servant the prophet .
the lion have roar , who will not fear ? the lord god have speak , who can but prophesy ?
publish in the palace at ashdod , and in the palace in the land of egypt , and say , assemble yourselve upon the mountain of samaria , and behold the great tumult in the midst thereof , and the oppress in the midst thereof .
for they know not to do right , saith the lord , who store up violence and robbery in they palace .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; a adversary there shall be even round about the land ; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee , and thy palace shall be spoil .
thus saith the lord ; as the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two leg , or a piece of a ear ; so shall the child of israel be take out that dwell in samaria in the corner of a bed , and in damascus in a couch .
hear ye , and testify in the house of jacob , saith the lord god , the god of host ,
that in the day that i shall visit the transgression of israel upon he i will also visit the altar of bethel : and the horn of the altar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
and i will smite the winter house with the summer house ; and the house of ivory shall perish , and the great house shall have a end , saith the lord .
hear this word , ye kine of bashan , that be in the mountain of samaria , which oppress the poor , which crush the needy , which say to they master , bring , and let we drink .
the lord god have swear by he holiness , that , lo , the day shall come upon you , that he will take you away with hook , and you posterity with fishhook .
and ye shall go out at the breach , every cow at that which be before she ; and ye shall cast they into the palace , saith the lord .
come to bethel , and transgress ; at gilgal multiply transgression ; and bring you sacrifice every morning , and you tithe after three year :
and offer a sacrifice of thanksgive with leaven , and proclaim and publish the free offering : for this liketh you , o ye child of israel , saith the lord god .
and i also have give you cleanness of tooth in all you city , and want of bread in all you place : yet have ye not return unto i , saith the lord .
and also i have withholden the rain from you , when there be yet three month to the harvest : and i cause it to rain upon one city , and cause it not to rain upon another city : one piece be rain upon , and the piece whereupon it rain not wither .
so two or three city wander unto one city , to drink water ; but they be not satisfied : yet have ye not return unto i , saith the lord .
i have smite you with blast and mildew : when you garden and you vineyard and you fig tree and you olive tree increase , the palmerworm devour they : yet have ye not return unto i , saith the lord .
i have send among you the pestilence after the manner of egypt : you young man have i slay with the sword , and have take away you horse ; and i have make the stink of you camp to come up unto you nostril : yet have ye not return unto i , saith the lord .
i have overthrow some of you , as god overthrow sodom and gomorrah , and ye be as a firebrand pluck out of the burning : yet have ye not return unto i , saith the lord .
therefore thus will i do unto thee , o israel : and because i will do this unto thee , prepare to meet thy god , o israel .
for , lo , he that formeth the mountain , and createth the wind , and declareth unto man what be he thought , that maketh the morning darkness , and treadeth upon the high place of the earth , the lord , the god of host , be he name .
hear ye this word which i take up against you , even a lamentation , o house of israel .
the virgin of israel be fall ; she shall no more rise : she be forsake upon she land ; there be none to raise she up .
for thus saith the lord god ; the city that go out by a thousand shall leave a hundred , and that which go forth by a hundred shall leave ten , to the house of israel .
for thus saith the lord unto the house of israel , seek ye i , and ye shall live :
but seek not bethel , nor enter into gilgal , and pass not to beersheba : for gilgal shall surely go into captivity , and bethel shall come to nought .
seek the lord , and ye shall live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of joseph , and devour it , and there be none to quench it in bethel .
ye who turn judgment to wormwood , and leave off righteousness in the earth ,
seek he that maketh the seven star and orion , and turneth the shadow of death into the morning , and maketh the day dark with night : that calleth for the water of the sea , and poureth they out upon the face of the earth : the lord be he name :
that strengtheneth the spoil against the strong , so that the spoil shall come against the fortress .
they hate he that rebuketh in the gate , and they abhor he that speaketh uprightly .
forasmuch therefore as you treading be upon the poor , and ye take from he burden of wheat : ye have build house of hew stone , but ye shall not dwell in they ; ye have plant pleasant vineyard , but ye shall not drink wine of they .
for i know you manifold transgression and you mighty sin : they afflict the just , they take a bribe , and they turn aside the poor in the gate from they right .
therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time ; for it be a evil time .
seek good , and not evil , that ye may live : and so the lord , the god of host , shall be with you , as ye have speak .
hate the evil , and love the good , and establish judgment in the gate : it may be that the lord god of host will be gracious unto the remnant of joseph .
therefore the lord , the god of host , the lord , saith thus ; wail shall be in all street ; and they shall say in all the highway , alas ! alas ! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning , and such as be skilful of lamentation to wail .
and in all vineyard shall be wail : for i will pass through thee , saith the lord .
woe unto you that desire the day of the lord ! to what end be it for you ? the day of the lord be darkness , and not light .
as if a man do flee from a lion , and a bear meet he ; or go into the house , and lean he hand on the wall , and a serpent bit he .
shall not the day of the lord be darkness , and not light ? even very dark , and no brightness in it ?
i hate , i despise you feast day , and i will not smell in you solemn assembly .
though ye offer i burnt offering and you meat offering , i will not accept they : neither will i regard the peace offering of you fat beast .
take thou away from i the noise of thy song ; for i will not hear the melody of thy viol .
but let judgment run down as water , and righteousness as a mighty stream .
have ye offer unto i sacrifice and offering in the wilderness forty year , o house of israel ?
but ye have bear the tabernacle of you moloch and chiun you image , the star of you god , which ye make to yourselve .
therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus , saith the lord , whose name be the god of host .
woe to they that be at ease in zion , and trust in the mountain of samaria , which be name chief of the nation , to whom the house of israel come !
pass ye unto calneh , and see ; and from thence go ye to hamath the great : then go down to gath of the philistines : be they better than these kingdom ? or they border greater than you border ?
ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
that lie upon bed of ivory , and stretch themselves upon they couch , and eat the lamb out of the flock , and the calf out of the midst of the stall ;
that chant to the sound of the viol , and invent to themselves instrument of musick , like david ;
that drink wine in bowl , and anoint themselves with the chief ointment : but they be not grieve for the affliction of joseph .
therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive , and the banquet of they that stretch themselves shall be remove .
the lord god have swear by himself , saith the lord the god of host , i abhor the excellency of jacob , and hate he palace : therefore will i deliver up the city with all that be therein .
and it shall come to pass , if there remain ten man in one house , that they shall die .
and a man 's uncle shall take he up , and he that burneth he , to bring out the bone out of the house , and shall say unto he that be by the side of the house , be there yet any with thee ? and he shall say , no. .
then shall he say , hold thy tongue : for we may not make mention of the name of the lord .
for , behold , the lord commandeth , and he will smite the great house with breach , and the little house with cleft .
shall horse run upon the rock ? will one plow there with ox ? for ye have turn judgment into gall , and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock :
ye which rejoice in a thing of nought , which say , have we not take to we horn by we own strength ?
but , behold , i will raise up against you a nation , o house of israel , saith the lord the god of host ; and they shall afflict you from the enter in of hemath unto the river of the wilderness .
thus have the lord god shew unto i ; and , behold , he form grasshopper in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and , lo , it be the latter growth after the king 's mowing .
and it come to pass , that when they have make a end of eat the grass of the land , then i say , o lord god , forgive , i beseech thee : by whom shall jacob arise ? for he be small .
the lord repent for this : it shall not be , saith the lord .
thus have the lord god shew unto i : and , behold , the lord god call to contend by fire , and it devour the great deep , and do eat up a part .
then say i , o lord god , cease , i beseech thee : by whom shall jacob arise ? for he be small .
the lord repent for this : this also shall not be , saith the lord god .
thus he shew i : and , behold , the lord stand upon a wall make by a plumbline , with a plumbline in he hand .
and the lord say unto i , amos , what seest thou ?
and i say , a plumbline .
then say the lord , behold , i will set a plumbline in the midst of my people israel : i will not again pass by they any more :
and the high place of isaac shall be desolate , and the sanctuary of israel shall be lay waste ; and i will rise against the house of jeroboam with the sword .
then amaziah the priest of bethel send to jeroboam king of israel , say , amos have conspire against thee in the midst of the house of israel : the land be not able to bear all he word .
for thus amos saith , jeroboam shall die by the sword , and israel shall surely be lead away captive out of they own land .
also amaziah say unto amos , o thou seer , go , flee thee away into the land of judah , and there eat bread , and prophesy there :
but prophesy not again any more at bethel : for it be the king 's chapel , and it be the king 's court .
then answer amos , and say to amaziah , i be no prophet , neither be i a prophet 's son ; but i be a herdman , and a gatherer of sycomore fruit :
and the lord take i as i follow the flock , and the lord say unto i , go , prophesy unto my people israel .
now therefore hear thou the word of the lord : thou sayest , prophesy not against israel , and drop not thy word against the house of isaac .
therefore thus saith the lord ; thy wife shall be a harlot in the city , and thy son and thy daughter shall fall by the sword , and thy land shall be divide by line ; and thou shalt die in a polluted land : and israel shall surely go into captivity forth of he land .
thus have the lord god shew unto i : and behold a basket of summer fruit .
and he say , amos , what seest thou ?
and i say , a basket of summer fruit .
then say the lord unto i , the end be come upon my people of israel ; i will not again pass by they any more .
and the song of the temple shall be howling in that day , saith the lord god : there shall be many dead body in every place ; they shall cast they forth with silence .
hear this , o ye that swallow up the needy , even to make the poor of the land to fail ,
say , when will the new moon be go , that we may sell corn ? and the sabbath , that we may set forth wheat , make the ephah small , and the shekel great , and falsify the balance by deceit ?
that we may buy the poor for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoe ; yea , and sell the refuse of the wheat ?
the lord have swear by the excellency of jacob , surely i will never forget any of they work .
shall not the land tremble for this , and every one mourn that dwelleth therein ? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood ; and it shall be cast out and drown , as by the flood of egypt .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the lord god , that i will cause the sun to go down at noon , and i will darken the earth in the clear day :
and i will turn you feast into mourning , and all you song into lamentation ; and i will bring up sackcloth upon all loin , and baldness upon every head ; and i will make it as the mourning of a only son , and the end thereof as a bitter day .
behold , the day come , saith the lord god , that i will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hear the word of the lord :
and they shall wander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east , they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord , and shall not find it .
in that day shall the fair virgin and young man faint for thirst .
they that swear by the sin of samaria , and say , thy god , o dan , liveth ; and , the manner of beersheba liveth ; even they shall fall , and never rise up again .
i see the lord standing upon the altar : and he say , smite the lintel of the door , that the post may shake : and cut they in the head , all of they ; and i will slay the last of they with the sword : he that fleeth of they shall not flee away , and he that escapeth of they shall not be deliver .
though they dig into hell , thence shall mine hand take they ; though they climb up to heaven , thence will i bring they down :
and though they hide themselves in the top of carmel , i will search and take they out thence ; and though they be hide from my sight in the bottom of the sea , thence will i command the serpent , and he shall bite they :
and though they go into captivity before they enemy , thence will i command the sword , and it shall slay they : and i will set mine eye upon they for evil , and not for good .
and the lord god of host be he that toucheth the land , and it shall melt , and all that dwell therein shall mourn : and it shall rise up wholly like a flood ; and shall be drown , as by the flood of egypt .
it be he that buildeth he story in the heaven , and have found he troop in the earth ; he that calleth for the water of the sea , and poureth they out upon the face of the earth : the lord be he name .
be ye not as child of the ethiopians unto i , o child of israel ? saith the lord .
have not i bring up israel out of the land of egypt ? and the philistines from caphtor , and the syrians from kir ?
behold , the eye of the lord god be upon the sinful kingdom , and i will destroy it from off the face of the earth ; save that i will not utterly destroy the house of jacob , saith the lord .
for , lo , i will command , and i will sift the house of israel among all nation , like as corn be sift in a sieve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
all the sinner of my people shall die by the sword , which say , the evil shall not overtake nor prevent we .
in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that be fall , and close up the breach thereof ; and i will raise up he ruin , and i will build it as in the day of old :
that they may possess the remnant of edom , and of all the heathen , which be call by my name , saith the lord that doeth this .
behold , the day come , saith the lord , that the plowman shall overtake the reaper , and the treader of grape he that soweth seed ; and the mountain shall drop sweet wine , and all the hill shall melt .
and i will bring again the captivity of my people of israel , and they shall build the waste city , and inhabit they ; and they shall plant vineyard , and drink the wine thereof ; they shall also make garden , and eat the fruit of they .
and i will plant they upon they land , and they shall no more be pull up out of they land which i have give they , saith the lord thy god .
the vision of obadiah .
thus saith the lord god concern edom ; we have hear a rumour from the lord , and a ambassador be send among the heathen , arise ye , and let we rise up against she in battle .
behold , i have make thee small among the heathen : thou art greatly despise .
the pride of thine heart have deceive thee , thou that dwellest in the cleft of the rock , whose habitation be high ; that saith in he heart , who shall bring i down to the ground ?
though thou exalt thyself as the eagle , and though thou set thy nest among the star , thence will i bring thee down , saith the lord .
if thief come to thee , if robber by night , ( how art thou cut off ! ) would they not have steal till they have enough ? if the grapegatherer come to thee , would they not leave some grape ?
how be the thing of esau search out ! how be he hidden thing seek up !
all the man of thy confederacy have bring thee even to the border : the man that be at peace with thee have deceive thee , and prevail against thee ; they that eat thy bread have lay a wound under thee : there be none understanding in he .
shall i not in that day , saith the lord , even destroy the wise man out of edom , and understand out of the mount of esau ?
and thy mighty man , o teman , shall be dismayed , to the end that every one of the mount of esau may be cut off by slaughter .
for thy violence against thy brother jacob shame shall cover thee , and thou shalt be cut off for ever .
in the day that thou stoodest on the other side , in the day that the stranger carry away captive he force , and foreigner enter into he gate , and cast lot upon jerusalem , even thou wast as one of they .
but thou shouldest not have look on the day of thy brother in the day that he become a stranger ; neither shouldest thou have rejoice over the child of judah in the day of they destruction ; neither shouldest thou have speak proudly in the day of distress .
thou shouldest not have enter into the gate of my people in the day of they calamity ; yea , thou shouldest not have look on they affliction in the day of they calamity , nor have lay hand on they substance in the day of they calamity ;
neither shouldest thou have stand in the crossway , to cut off those of he that do escape ; neither shouldest thou have deliver up those of he that do remain in the day of distress .
for the day of the lord be near upon all the heathen : as thou hast do , it shall be do unto thee : thy reward shall return upon thine own head .
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain , so shall all the heathen drink continually , yea , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they have not be .
but upon mount zion shall be deliverance , and there shall be holiness ; and the house of jacob shall possess they possession .
and the house of jacob shall be a fire , and the house of joseph a flame , and the house of esau for stubble , and they shall kindle in they , and devour they ; and there shall not be any remain of the house of esau ; for the lord have speak it .
and they of the south shall possess the mount of esau ; and they of the plain the philistines : and they shall possess the field of ephraim , and the field of samaria : and benjamin shall possess gilead .
and the captivity of this host of the child of israel shall possess that of the canaanites , even unto zarephath ; and the captivity of jerusalem , which be in sepharad , shall possess the city of the south .
and saviours shall come up on mount zion to judge the mount of esau ; and the kingdom shall be the lord 's .
now the word of the lord come unto jonah the son of amittai , say ,
arise , go to nineveh , that great city , and cry against it ; for they wickedness be come up before i .
but jonah rise up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord , and go down to joppa ; and he find a ship go to tarshish : so he pay the fare thereof , and go down into it , to go with they unto tarshish from the presence of the lord .
but the lord send out a great wind into the sea , and there be a mighty tempest in the sea , so that the ship be like to be break .
then the mariner be afraid , and cry every man unto he god , and cast forth the wares that be in the ship into the sea , to lighten it of they .
but jonah be go down into the side of the ship ; and he lay , and be fast asleep .
so the shipmaster come to he , and say unto he , what meanest thou , o sleeper ? arise , call upon thy god , if so be that god will think upon we , that we perish not .
and they say every one to he fellow , come , and let we cast lot , that we may know for whose cause this evil be upon we .
so they cast lot , and the lot fall upon jonah .
then say they unto he , tell we , we pray thee , for whose cause this evil be upon we ; what be thine occupation ? and whence comest thou ? what be thy country ? and of what people art thou ?
and he say unto they , i be a hebrew ; and i fear the lord , the god of heaven , which have make the sea and the dry land .
then be the man exceedingly afraid , and say unto he , why hast thou do this ?
for the man know that he flee from the presence of the lord , because he have tell they .
then say they unto he , what shall we do unto thee , that the sea may be calm unto we ? for the sea work , and be tempestuous .
and he say unto they , take i up , and cast i forth into the sea ; so shall the sea be calm unto you : for i know that for my sake this great tempest be upon you .
nevertheless the man row hard to bring it to the land ; but they could not : for the sea work , and be tempestuous against they .
wherefore they cry unto the lord , and say , we beseech thee , o lord , we beseech thee , let we not perish for this man 's life , and lay not upon we innocent blood : for thou , o lord , hast do as it pleased thee .
so they take up jonah , and cast he forth into the sea : and the sea cease from she rage .
then the man fear the lord exceedingly , and offer a sacrifice unto the lord , and make vow .
now the lord have prepare a great fish to swallow up jonah .
and jonah be in the belly of the fish three day and three night .
then jonah pray unto the lord he god out of the fish 's belly ,
and say , i cry by reason of mine affliction unto the lord , and he hear i ; out of the belly of hell cry i , and thou heardest my voice .
for thou hadst cast i into the deep , in the midst of the sea ; and the flood compass i about : all thy billow and thy wave pass over i .
then i say , i be cast out of thy sight ; yet i will look again toward thy holy temple .
the water compass i about , even to the soul : the depth close i round about , the weed be wrap about my head .
i go down to the bottom of the mountain ; the earth with she bar be about i for ever : yet hast thou bring up my life from corruption , o lord my god .
when my soul faint within i i remember the lord : and my prayer come in unto thee , into thine holy temple .
they that observe lie vanity forsake they own mercy .
but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving ; i will pay that that i have vow .
salvation be of the lord .
and the lord spake unto the fish , and it vomit out jonah upon the dry land .
and the word of the lord come unto jonah the second time , say ,
arise , go unto nineveh , that great city , and preach unto it the preach that i bid thee .
so jonah arise , and go unto nineveh , accord to the word of the lord .
now nineveh be a exceed great city of three day ' journey .
and jonah begin to enter into the city a day 's journey , and he cry , and say , yet forty day , and nineveh shall be overthrow .
so the people of nineveh believe god , and proclaim a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of they even to the least of they .
for word come unto the king of nineveh , and he arise from he throne , and he lay he robe from he , and cover he with sackcloth , and sit in ash .
and he cause it to be proclaimed and publish through nineveh by the decree of the king and he noble , say , let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock , taste any thing : let they not feed , nor drink water :
but let man and beast be cover with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto god : yea , let they turn every one from he evil way , and from the violence that be in they hand .
who can tell if god will turn and repent , and turn away from he fierce anger , that we perish not ?
and god see they work , that they turn from they evil way ; and god repent of the evil , that he have say that he would do unto they ; and he do it not .
but it displeased jonah exceedingly , and he be very angry .
and he pray unto the lord , and say , i pray thee , o lord , be not this my say , when i be yet in my country ?
therefore i flee before unto tarshish : for i know that thou art a gracious god , and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repentest thee of the evil .
therefore now , o lord , take , i beseech thee , my life from i ; for it be better for i to die than to live .
then say the lord , doest thou well to be angry ?
so jonah go out of the city , and sit on the east side of the city , and there make he a booth , and sit under it in the shadow , till he might see what would become of the city .
and the lord god prepare a gourd , and make it to come up over jonah , that it might be a shadow over he head , to deliver he from he grief .
so jonah be exceed glad of the gourd .
but god prepare a worm when the morning rise the next day , and it smite the gourd that it wither .
and it come to pass , when the sun do arise , that god prepare a vehement east wind ; and the sun beat upon the head of jonah , that he faint , and wish in himself to die , and say , it be better for i to die than to live .
and god say to jonah , doest thou well to be angry for the gourd ?
and he say , i do well to be angry , even unto death .
then say the lord , thou hast have pity on the gourd , for the which thou hast not laboured , neither madest it grow ; which come up in a night , and perish in a night :
and should not i spare nineveh , that great city , wherein be more than sixscore thousand person that can not discern between they right hand and they left hand ; and also much cattle ?
the word of the lord that come to micah the morasthite in the day of jotham , ahaz , and hezekiah , king of judah , which he see concern samaria and jerusalem .
hear , all ye people ; hearken , o earth , and all that therein be : and let the lord god be witness against you , the lord from he holy temple .
for , behold , the lord cometh forth out of he place , and will come down , and tread upon the high place of the earth .
and the mountain shall be melt under he , and the valley shall be cleft , as wax before the fire , and as the water that be pour down a steep place .
for the transgression of jacob be all this , and for the sin of the house of israel .
what be the transgression of jacob ? be it not samaria ? and what be the high place of judah ? be they not jerusalem ?
therefore i will make samaria as a heap of the field , and as planting of a vineyard : and i will pour down the stone thereof into the valley , and i will discover the foundation thereof .
and all the graven image thereof shall be beat to piece , and all the hire thereof shall be burn with the fire , and all the idol thereof will i lay desolate : for she gather it of the hire of a harlot , and they shall return to the hire of a harlot .
therefore i will wail and howl , i will go strip and naked : i will make a wail like the dragon , and mourning as the owl .
for she wound be incurable ; for it be come unto judah ; he be come unto the gate of my people , even to jerusalem .
declare ye it not at gath , weep ye not at all : in the house of aphrah roll thyself in the dust .
pass ye away , thou inhabitant of saphir , have thy shame naked : the inhabitant of zaanan come not forth in the mourning of bethezel ; he shall receive of you he standing .
for the inhabitant of maroth wait carefully for good : but evil come down from the lord unto the gate of jerusalem .
o thou inhabitant of lachish , bind the chariot to the swift beast : she be the beginning of the sin to the daughter of zion : for the transgression of israel be find in thee .
therefore shalt thou give present to moreshethgath : the house of achzib shall be a lie to the king of israel .
yet will i bring a heir unto thee , o inhabitant of mareshah : he shall come unto adullam the glory of israel .
make thee bald , and poll thee for thy delicate child ; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle ; for they be go into captivity from thee .
woe to they that devise iniquity , and work evil upon they bed ! when the morning be light , they practise it , because it be in the power of they hand .
and they covet field , and take they by violence ; and house , and take they away : so they oppress a man and he house , even a man and he heritage .
therefore thus saith the lord ; behold , against this family do i devise a evil , from which ye shall not remove you neck ; neither shall ye go haughtily : for this time be evil .
in that day shall one take up a parable against you , and lament with a doleful lamentation , and say , we be utterly spoil : he have change the portion of my people : how have he remove it from i ! turn away he have divide we field .
therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the lord .
prophesy ye not , say they to they that prophesy : they shall not prophesy to they , that they shall not take shame .
o thou that art name the house of jacob , be the spirit of the lord straiten ? be these he doings ? do not my word do good to he that walketh uprightly ?
even of late my people be rise up as a enemy : ye pull off the robe with the garment from they that pass by securely as man averse from war .
the woman of my people have ye cast out from they pleasant house ; from they child have ye take away my glory for ever .
arise ye , and depart ; for this be not you rest : because it be polluted , it shall destroy you , even with a sore destruction .
if a man walk in the spirit and falsehood do lie , say , i will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink ; he shall even be the prophet of this people .
i will surely assemble , o jacob , all of thee ; i will surely gather the remnant of israel ; i will put they together as the sheep of bozrah , as the flock in the midst of they fold : they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of man .
the breaker be come up before they : they have break up , and have pass through the gate , and be go out by it : and they king shall pass before they , and the lord on the head of they .
and i say , hear , i pray you , o head of jacob , and ye prince of the house of israel ; be it not for you to know judgment ?
who hate the good , and love the evil ; who pluck off they skin from off they , and they flesh from off they bone ;
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay they skin from off they ; and they break they bone , and chop they in piece , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then shall they cry unto the lord , but he will not hear they : he will even hide he face from they at that time , as they have behave themselves ill in they doings .
thus saith the lord concern the prophet that make my people err , that bite with they tooth , and cry , peace ; and he that putteth not into they mouth , they even prepare war against he .
therefore night shall be unto you , that ye shall not have a vision ; and it shall be dark unto you , that ye shall not divine ; and the sun shall go down over the prophet , and the day shall be dark over they .
then shall the seer be ashamed , and the diviner confound : yea , they shall all cover they lip ; for there be no answer of god .
but truly i be full of power by the spirit of the lord , and of judgment , and of might , to declare unto jacob he transgression , and to israel he sin .
hear this , i pray you , ye head of the house of jacob , and prince of the house of israel , that abhor judgment , and pervert all equity .
they build up zion with blood , and jerusalem with iniquity .
the head thereof judge for reward , and the priest thereof teach for hire , and the prophet thereof divine for money : yet will they lean upon the lord , and say , be not the lord among we ? none evil can come upon we .
therefore shall zion for you sake be plow as a field , and jerusalem shall become heap , and the mountain of the house as the high place of the forest .
but in the last day it shall come to pass , that the mountain of the house of the lord shall be establish in the top of the mountain , and it shall be exalt above the hill ; and people shall flow unto it .
and many nation shall come , and say , come , and let we go up to the mountain of the lord , and to the house of the god of jacob ; and he will teach we of he way , and we will walk in he path : for the law shall go forth of zion , and the word of the lord from jerusalem .
and he shall judge among many people , and rebuke strong nation afar off ; and they shall beat they sword into plowshare , and they spear into pruninghook : nation shall not lift up a sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
but they shall sit every man under he vine and under he fig tree ; and none shall make they afraid : for the mouth of the lord of host have speak it .
for all people will walk every one in the name of he god , and we will walk in the name of the lord we god for ever and ever .
in that day , saith the lord , will i assemble she that halteth , and i will gather she that be drive out , and she that i have afflict ;
and i will make she that halt a remnant , and she that be cast far off a strong nation : and the lord shall reign over they in mount zion from henceforth , even for ever .
and thou , o tower of the flock , the strong hold of the daughter of zion , unto thee shall it come , even the first dominion ; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of jerusalem .
now why dost thou cry out aloud ? be there no king in thee ? be thy counsellor perish ? for pang have take thee as a woman in travail .
be in pain , and labour to bring forth , o daughter of zion , like a woman in travail : for now shalt thou go forth out of the city , and thou shalt dwell in the field , and thou shalt go even to babylon ; there shalt thou be deliver ; there the lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemy .
now also many nation be gather against thee , that say , let she be defile , and let we eye look upon zion .
but they know not the thought of the lord , neither understand they he counsel : for he shall gather they as the sheaf into the floor .
arise and thresh , o daughter of zion : for i will make thine horn iron , and i will make thy hoof brass : and thou shalt beat in piece many people : and i will consecrate they gain unto the lord , and they substance unto the lord of the whole earth .
now gather thyself in troops , o daughter of troops : he have lay siege against we : they shall smite the judge of israel with a rod upon the cheek .
but thou , bethlehem ephratah , though thou be little among the thousand of judah , yet out of thee shall he come forth unto i that be to be ruler in israel ; whose going forth have be from of old , from everlasting .
therefore will he give they up , until the time that she which travaileth have bring forth : then the remnant of he brethren shall return unto the child of israel .
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord , in the majesty of the name of the lord he god ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth .
and this man shall be the peace , when the assyrian shall come into we land : and when he shall tread in we palace , then shall we raise against he seven shepherd , and eight principal man .
and they shall waste the land of assyrium with the sword , and the land of nimrod in the entrance thereof : thus shall he deliver we from the assyrian , when he cometh into we land , and when he treadeth within we border .
and the remnant of jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the lord , as the shower upon the grass , that tarrieth not for man , nor waiteth for the son of man .
and the remnant of jacob shall be among the gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beast of the forest , as a young lion among the flock of sheep : who , if he go through , both treadeth down , and teareth in piece , and none can deliver .
thine hand shall be lift up upon thine adversary , and all thine enemy shall be cut off .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the lord , that i will cut off thy horse out of the midst of thee , and i will destroy thy chariot :
and i will cut off the city of thy land , and throw down all thy strong hold :
and i will cut off witchcraft out of thine hand ; and thou shalt have no more soothsayer :
thy grave image also will i cut off , and thy standing image out of the midst of thee ; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hand .
and i will pluck up thy grove out of the midst of thee : so will i destroy thy city .
and i will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen , such as they have not hear .
hear ye now what the lord saith ; arise , contend thou before the mountain , and let the hill hear thy voice .
hear ye , o mountain , the lord 's controversy , and ye strong foundation of the earth : for the lord have a controversy with he people , and he will plead with israel .
o my people , what have i do unto thee ? and wherein have i weary thee ? testify against i .
for i bring thee up out of the land of egypt , and redeem thee out of the house of servant ; and i send before thee mose , aaron , and miriam .
o my people , remember now what balak king of moab consult , and what balaam the son of beor answer he from shittim unto gilgal ; that ye may know the righteousness of the lord .
wherewith shall i come before the lord , and bow myself before the high god ? shall i come before he with burnt offering , with calf of a year old ?
will the lord be please with thousand of ram , or with ten thousand of river of oil ? shall i give my firstborn for my transgression , the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
he have shewed thee , o man , what be good ; and what doth the lord require of thee , but to do justly , and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with thy god ?
the lord 's voice crieth unto the city , and the man of wisdom shall see thy name : hear ye the rod , and who have appoint it .
be there yet the treasure of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and the scant measure that be abominable ?
shall i count they pure with the wicked balance , and with the bag of deceitful weight ?
for the rich man thereof be full of violence , and the inhabitant thereof have speak lie , and they tongue be deceitful in they mouth .
therefore also will i make thee sick in smite thee , in make thee desolate because of thy sin .
thou shalt eat , but not be satisfy ; and thy cast down shall be in the midst of thee ; and thou shalt take hold , but shalt not deliver ; and that which thou deliverest will i give up to the sword .
thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt tread the olive , but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil ; and sweet wine , but shalt not drink wine .
for the statute of omri be keep , and all the work of the house of ahab , and ye walk in they counsel ; that i should make thee a desolation , and the inhabitant thereof a hissing : therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people .
woe be i ! for i be as when they have gather the summer fruit , as the grapegleaning of the vintage : there be no cluster to eat : my soul desire the firstripe fruit .
the good man be perish out of the earth : and there be none upright among man : they all lie in wait for blood ; they hunt every man he brother with a net .
that they may do evil with both hand earnestly , the prince asketh , and the judge asketh for a reward ; and the great man , he uttereth he mischievous desire : so they wrap it up .
the best of they be as a brier : the most upright be sharper than a thorn hedge : the day of thy watchman and thy visitation cometh ; now shall be they perplexity .
trust ye not in a friend , put ye not confidence in a guide : keep the door of thy mouth from she that lieth in thy bosom .
for the son dishonoureth the father , the daughter riseth up against she mother , the daughter in law against she mother in law ; a man 's enemy be the man of he own house .
therefore i will look unto the lord ; i will wait for the god of my salvation : my god will hear i .
rejoice not against i , o mine enemy : when i fall , i shall arise ; when i sit in darkness , the lord shall be a light unto i .
i will bear the indignation of the lord , because i have sin against he , until he plead my cause , and execute judgment for i : he will bring i forth to the light , and i shall behold he righteousness .
then she that be mine enemy shall see it , and shame shall cover she which say unto i , where be the lord thy god ? mine eye shall behold she : now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the street .
in the day that thy wall be to be build , in that day shall the decree be far remove .
in that day also he shall come even to thee from assyria , and from the fortify city , and from the fortress even to the river , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of they that dwell therein , for the fruit of they doings .
feed thy people with thy rod , the flock of thine heritage , which dwell solitarily in the wood , in the midst of carmel : let they feed in bashan and gilead , as in the day of old .
accord to the day of thy come out of the land of egypt will i shew unto he marvellous thing .
the nation shall see and be confound at all they might : they shall lay they hand upon they mouth , they ear shall be deaf .
they shall lick the dust like a serpent , they shall move out of they hole like worm of the earth : they shall be afraid of the lord we god , and shall fear because of thee .
who be a god like unto thee , that pardoneth iniquity , and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of he heritage ? he retaineth not he anger for ever , because he delighteth in mercy .
he will turn again , he will have compassion upon we ; he will subdue we iniquity ; and thou wilt cast all they sin into the depths of the sea .
thou wilt perform the truth to jacob , and the mercy to abraham , which thou hast swear unto we father from the day of old .
the burden of nineveh .
the book of the vision of nahum the elkoshite .
god be jealous , and the lord revengeth ; the lord revengeth , and be furious ; the lord will take vengeance on he adversary , and he reserveth wrath for he enemy .
the lord be slow to anger , and great in power , and will not at all acquit the wicked : the lord have he way in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the cloud be the dust of he foot .
he rebuketh the sea , and maketh it dry , and drieth up all the river : bashan languisheth , and carmel , and the flower of lebanon languisheth .
the mountain quake at he , and the hill melt , and the earth be burn at he presence , yea , the world , and all that dwell therein .
who can stand before he indignation ? and who can abide in the fierceness of he anger ? he fury be pour out like fire , and the rock be throw down by he .
the lord be good , a strong hold in the day of trouble ; and he knoweth they that trust in he .
but with a overrun flood he will make a utter end of the place thereof , and darkness shall pursue he enemy .
what do ye imagine against the lord ? he will make a utter end : affliction shall not rise up the second time .
for while they be folden together as thorn , and while they be drunken as drunkard , they shall be devour as stubble fully dry .
there be one come out of thee , that imagineth evil against the lord , a wicked counsellor .
thus saith the lord ; though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down , when he shall pass through .
though i have afflict thee , i will afflict thee no more .
for now will i break he yoke from off thee , and will burst thy bond in sunder .
and the lord have give a commandment concern thee , that no more of thy name be sow : out of the house of thy god will i cut off the graven image and the molten image : i will make thy grave ; for thou art vile .
behold upon the mountain the foot of he that bringeth good tiding , that publisheth peace !
o judah , keep thy solemn feast , perform thy vow : for the wicked shall no more pass through thee ; he be utterly cut off .
he that dasheth in piece be come up before thy face : keep the munition , watch the way , make thy loin strong , fortify thy power mightily .
for the lord have turn away the excellency of jacob , as the excellency of israel : for the emptier have empty they out , and mar they vine branch .
the shield of he mighty man be make red , the valiant man be in scarlet : the chariot shall be with flaming torch in the day of he preparation , and the fir tree shall be terribly shake .
the chariot shall rage in the street , they shall justle one against another in the broad way : they shall seem like torch , they shall run like the lightning .
he shall recount he worthy : they shall stumble in they walk ; they shall make haste to the wall thereof , and the defence shall be prepare .
the gate of the river shall be open , and the palace shall be dissolve .
and huzzab shall be lead away captive , she shall be bring up , and she maid shall lead she as with the voice of dove , taber upon they breast .
but nineveh be of old like a pool of water : yet they shall flee away .
stand , stand , shall they cry ; but none shall look back .
take ye the spoil of silver , take the spoil of gold : for there be none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture .
she be empty , and void , and waste : and the heart melteth , and the knee smite together , and much pain be in all loin , and the face of they all gather blackness .
where be the dwelling of the lion , and the feedingplace of the young lion , where the lion , even the old lion , walk , and the lion 's whelp , and none make they afraid ?
the lion do tear in piece enough for he whelp , and strangle for he lioness , and fill he hole with prey , and he den with ravin .
behold , i be against thee , saith the lord of host , and i will burn she chariot in the smoke , and the sword shall devour thy young lion : and i will cut off thy prey from the earth , and the voice of thy messenger shall no more be hear .
woe to the bloody city ! it be all full of lie and robbery ; the prey departeth not ;
the noise of a whip , and the noise of the rattle of the wheel , and of the pranse horse , and of the jump chariot .
the horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear : and there be a multitude of slay , and a great number of carcase ; and there be none end of they corpse ; they stumble upon they corpse :
because of the multitude of the whoredom of the wellfavoured harlot , the mistress of witchcraft , that selleth nation through she whoredom , and family through she witchcraft .
behold , i be against thee , saith the lord of host ; and i will discover thy skirt upon thy face , and i will shew the nation thy nakedness , and the kingdom thy shame .
and i will cast abominable filth upon thee , and make thee vile , and will set thee as a gazingstock .
and it shall come to pass , that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee , and say , nineveh be lay waste : who will bemoan she ? whence shall i seek comforter for thee ?
art thou better than populous no , that be situate among the river , that have the water round about it , whose rampart be the sea , and she wall be from the sea ?
ethiopia and egypt be she strength , and it be infinite ; put and lubim be thy helper .
yet be she carry away , she go into captivity : she young child also be dash in piece at the top of all the street : and they cast lot for she honourable man , and all she great man be bind in chain .
thou also shalt be drunken : thou shalt be hide , thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy .
all thy strong hold shall be like fig tree with the firstripe fig : if they be shake , they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater .
behold , thy people in the midst of thee be woman : the gate of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemy : the fire shall devour thy bar .
draw thee water for the siege , fortify thy strong hold : go into clay , and tread the morter , make strong the brickkiln .
there shall the fire devour thee ; the sword shall cut thee off , it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm : make thyself many as the cankerworm , make thyself many as the locust .
thou hast multiply thy merchant above the star of heaven : the cankerworm spoileth , and fleeth away .
thy crown be as the locust , and thy captain as the great grasshopper , which camp in the hedge in the cold day , but when the sun ariseth they flee away , and they place be not know where they be .
thy shepherd slumber , o king of assyria : thy noble shall dwell in the dust : thy people be scatter upon the mountain , and no man gathereth they .
there be no healing of thy bruise ; thy wound be grievous : all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hand over thee : for upon whom have not thy wickedness pass continually ?
the burden which habakkuk the prophet do see .
o lord , how long shall i cry , and thou wilt not hear ! even cry out unto thee of violence , and thou wilt not save !
why dost thou shew i iniquity , and cause i to behold grievance ? for spoil and violence be before i : and there be that raise up strife and contention .
therefore the law be slack , and judgment doth never go forth : for the wicked doth compass about the righteous ; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth .
behold ye among the heathen , and regard , and wonder marvellously : for i will work a work in you day , which ye will not believe , though it be tell you .
for , lo , i raise up the chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , which shall march through the breadth of the land , to possess the dwellingplace that be not theirs .
they be terrible and dreadful : they judgment and they dignity shall proceed of themselves .
they horse also be swifter than the leopard , and be more fierce than the evening wolf : and they horseman shall spread themselves , and they horseman shall come from far ; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat .
they shall come all for violence : they face shall sup up as the east wind , and they shall gather the captivity as the sand .
and they shall scoff at the king , and the prince shall be a scorn unto they : they shall deride every strong hold ; for they shall heap dust , and take it .
then shall he mind change , and he shall pass over , and offend , impute this he power unto he god .
art thou not from everlasting , o lord my god , mine holy one ? we shall not die .
o lord , thou hast ordain they for judgment ; and , o mighty god , thou hast establish they for correction .
thou art of purer eye than to behold evil , and canst not look on iniquity : wherefore lookest thou upon they that deal treacherously , and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that be more righteous than he ?
and makest man as the fish of the sea , as the creep thing , that have no ruler over they ?
they take up all of they with the angle , they catch they in they net , and gather they in they drag : therefore they rejoice and be glad .
therefore they sacrifice unto they net , and burn incense unto they drag ; because by they they portion be fat , and they meat plenteous .
shall they therefore empty they net , and not spare continually to slay the nation ?
i will stand upon my watch , and set i upon the tower , and will watch to see what he will say unto i , and what i shall answer when i be reprove .
and the lord answer i , and say , write the vision , and make it plain upon table , that he may run that readeth it .
for the vision be yet for a appoint time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tarry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tarry .
behold , he soul which be lift up be not upright in he : but the just shall live by he faith .
yea also , because he transgresseth by wine , he be a proud man , neither keepeth at home , who enlargeth he desire as hell , and be as death , and can not be satisfy , but gathereth unto he all nation , and heapeth unto he all people :
shall not all these take up a parable against he , and a taunt proverb against he , and say , woe to he that increaseth that which be not he ! how long ? and to he that ladeth himself with thick clay !
shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee , and awake that shall vex thee , and thou shalt be for booty unto they ?
because thou hast spoil many nation , all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of man 's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
woe to he that coveteth a evil covetousness to he house , that he may set he nest on high , that he may be deliver from the power of evil !
thou hast consult shame to thy house by cut off many people , and hast sin against thy soul .
for the stone shall cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the timber shall answer it .
woe to he that buildeth a town with blood , and stablisheth a city by iniquity !
behold , be it not of the lord of host that the people shall labour in the very fire , and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity ?
for the earth shall be fill with the knowledge of the glory of the lord , as the water cover the sea .
woe unto he that giveth he neighbour drink , that puttest thy bottle to he , and makest he drunken also , that thou mayest look on they nakedness !
thou art fill with shame for glory : drink thou also , and let thy foreskin be uncover : the cup of the lord 's right hand shall be turn unto thee , and shameful spew shall be on thy glory .
for the violence of lebanon shall cover thee , and the spoil of beast , which make they afraid , because of man 's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
what profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof have grave it ; the molten image , and a teacher of lie , that the maker of he work trusteth therein , to make dumb idol ?
woe unto he that saith to the wood , awake ; to the dumb stone , arise , it shall teach !
behold , it be lay over with gold and silver , and there be no breath at all in the midst of it .
but the lord be in he holy temple : let all the earth keep silence before he .
a prayer of habakkuk the prophet upon shigionoth .
o lord , i have hear thy speech , and be afraid : o lord , revive thy work in the midst of the year , in the midst of the year make know ; in wrath remember mercy .
god come from teman , and the holy one from mount paran .
selah .
he glory cover the heaven , and the earth be full of he praise .
and he brightness be as the light ; he have horn come out of he hand : and there be the hiding of he power .
before he go the pestilence , and burn coal go forth at he foot .
he stand , and measure the earth : he behold , and drive asunder the nation ; and the everlasting mountain be scatter , the perpetual hill do bow : he way be everlasting .
i see the tent of cushan in affliction : and the curtain of the land of midian do tremble .
be the lord displeased against the river ? be thine anger against the river ? be thy wrath against the sea , that thou didst ride upon thine horse and thy chariot of salvation ?
thy bow be make quite naked , accord to the oath of the tribe , even thy word .
selah .
thou didst cleave the earth with river .
the mountain see thee , and they tremble : the overflow of the water pass by : the deep utter he voice , and lift up he hand on high .
the sun and moon stand still in they habitation : at the light of thine arrow they go , and at the shine of thy glittering spear .
thou didst march through the land in indignation , thou didst thresh the heathen in anger .
thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people , even for salvation with thine anoint ; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked , by discover the foundation unto the neck .
selah .
thou didst strike through with he stave the head of he village : they come out as a whirlwind to scatter i : they rejoicing be as to devour the poor secretly .
thou didst walk through the sea with thine horse , through the heap of great water .
when i hear , my belly tremble ; my lip quiver at the voice : rottenness enter into my bone , and i tremble in myself , that i might rest in the day of trouble : when he cometh up unto the people , he will invade they with he troops .
although the fig tree shall not blossom , neither shall fruit be in the vine ; the labour of the olive shall fail , and the field shall yield no meat ; the flock shall be cut off from the fold , and there shall be no herd in the stall :
yet i will rejoice in the lord , i will joy in the god of my salvation .
the lord god be my strength , and he will make my foot like hind ' foot , and he will make i to walk upon mine high place .
to the chief singer on my stringed instrument .
the word of the lord which come unto zephaniah the son of cushi , the son of gedaliah , the son of amariah , the son of hizkiah , in the day of josiah the son of amon , king of judah .
i will utterly consume all thing from off the land , saith the lord .
i will consume man and beast ; i will consume the fowl of the heaven , and the fish of the sea , and the stumble block with the wicked : and i will cut off man from off the land , saith the lord .
i will also stretch out mine hand upon judah , and upon all the inhabitant of jerusalem ; and i will cut off the remnant of baal from this place , and the name of the chemarims with the priest ;
and they that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops ; and they that worship and that swear by the lord , and that swear by malcham ;
and they that be turn back from the lord ; and those that have not seek the lord , nor enquire for he .
hold thy peace at the presence of the lord god : for the day of the lord be at hand : for the lord have prepare a sacrifice , he have bid he guest .
and it shall come to pass in the day of the lord 's sacrifice , that i will punish the prince , and the king 's child , and all such as be clothe with strange apparel .
in the same day also will i punish all those that leap on the threshold , which fill they master ' house with violence and deceit .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the lord , that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate , and a howl from the second , and a great crash from the hill .
howl , ye inhabitant of maktesh , for all the merchant people be cut down ; all they that bear silver be cut off .
and it shall come to pass at that time , that i will search jerusalem with candle , and punish the man that be settle on they lees : that say in they heart , the lord will not do good , neither will he do evil .
therefore they goods shall become a booty , and they house a desolation : they shall also build house , but not inhabit they ; and they shall plant vineyard , but not drink the wine thereof .
the great day of the lord be near , it be near , and hasteth greatly , even the voice of the day of the lord : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly .
that day be a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distress , a day of wasteness and desolation , a day of darkness and gloominess , a day of cloud and thick darkness ,
a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced city , and against the high tower .
and i will bring distress upon man , that they shall walk like blind man , because they have sin against the lord : and they blood shall be pour out as dust , and they flesh as the dung .
neither they silver nor they gold shall be able to deliver they in the day of the lord 's wrath ; but the whole land shall be devour by the fire of he jealousy : for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all they that dwell in the land .
gather yourselve together , yea , gather together , o nation not desire ;
before the decree bring forth , before the day pass as the chaff , before the fierce anger of the lord come upon you , before the day of the lord 's anger come upon you .
seek ye the lord , all ye meek of the earth , which have work he judgment ; seek righteousness , seek meekness : it may be ye shall be hide in the day of the lord 's anger .
for gaza shall be forsake , and ashkelon a desolation : they shall drive out ashdod at the noon day , and ekron shall be root up .
woe unto the inhabitant of the sea coast , the nation of the cherethites ! the word of the lord be against you ; o canaan , the land of the philistines , i will even destroy thee , that there shall be no inhabitant .
and the sea coast shall be dwelling and cottage for shepherd , and fold for flock .
and the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of judah ; they shall feed thereupon : in the house of ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening : for the lord they god shall visit they , and turn away they captivity .
i have hear the reproach of moab , and the reviling of the child of ammon , whereby they have reproach my people , and magnify themselves against they border .
therefore as i live , saith the lord of host , the god of israel , surely moab shall be as sodom , and the child of ammon as gomorrah , even the breeding of nettle , and saltpit , and a perpetual desolation : the residue of my people shall spoil they , and the remnant of my people shall possess they .
this shall they have for they pride , because they have reproach and magnify themselves against the people of the lord of host .
the lord will be terrible unto they : for he will famish all the god of the earth ; and man shall worship he , every one from he place , even all the isle of the heathen .
ye ethiopians also , ye shall be slay by my sword .
and he will stretch out he hand against the north , and destroy assyria ; and will make nineveh a desolation , and dry like a wilderness .
and flock shall lie down in the midst of she , all the beast of the nation : both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintel of it ; they voice shall sing in the window ; desolation shall be in the threshold : for he shall uncover the cedar work .
this be the rejoice city that dwell carelessly , that say in she heart , i be , and there be none beside i : how be she become a desolation , a place for beast to lie down in ! every one that passeth by she shall hiss , and wag he hand .
woe to she that be filthy and polluted , to the oppress city !
she obey not the voice ; she receive not correction ; she trust not in the lord ; she draw not near to she god .
she prince within she be roar lion ; she judge be evening wolf ; they gnaw not the bone till the morrow .
she prophet be light and treacherous person : she priest have polluted the sanctuary , they have do violence to the law .
the just lord be in the midst thereof ; he will not do iniquity : every morning doth he bring he judgment to light , he faileth not ; but the unjust knoweth no shame .
i have cut off the nation : they tower be desolate ; i make they street waste , that none passeth by : they city be destroy , so that there be no man , that there be none inhabitant .
i say , surely thou wilt fear i , thou wilt receive instruction ; so they dwelling should not be cut off , howsoever i punish they : but they rise early , and corrupt all they doings .
therefore wait ye upon i , saith the lord , until the day that i rise up to the prey : for my determination be to gather the nation , that i may assemble the kingdom , to pour upon they mine indignation , even all my fierce anger : for all the earth shall be devour with the fire of my jealousy .
for then will i turn to the people a pure language , that they may all call upon the name of the lord , to serve he with one consent .
from beyond the river of ethiopia my suppliant , even the daughter of my dispersed , shall bring mine offering .
in that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings , wherein thou hast transgress against i : for then i will take away out of the midst of thee they that rejoice in thy pride , and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain .
i will also leave in the midst of thee a afflict and poor people , and they shall trust in the name of the lord .
the remnant of israel shall not do iniquity , nor speak lie ; neither shall a deceitful tongue be find in they mouth : for they shall feed and lie down , and none shall make they afraid .
sing , o daughter of zion ; shout , o israel ; be glad and rejoice with all the heart , o daughter of jerusalem .
the lord have take away thy judgment , he have cast out thine enemy : the king of israel , even the lord , be in the midst of thee : thou shalt not see evil any more .
in that day it shall be say to jerusalem , fear thou not : and to zion , let not thine hand be slack .
the lord thy god in the midst of thee be mighty ; he will save , he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in he love , he will joy over thee with singing .
i will gather they that be sorrowful for the solemn assembly , who be of thee , to whom the reproach of it be a burden .
behold , at that time i will undo all that afflict thee : and i will save she that halteth , and gather she that be drive out ; and i will get they praise and fame in every land where they have be put to shame .
at that time will i bring you again , even in the time that i gather you : for i will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth , when i turn back you captivity before you eye , saith the lord .
in the second year of darius the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , come the word of the lord by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , governor of judah , and to joshua the son of josedech , the high priest , say ,
thus speaketh the lord of host , say , this people say , the time be not come , the time that the lord 's house should be build .
then come the word of the lord by haggai the prophet , say ,
be it time for you , o ye , to dwell in you cieled house , and this house lie waste ?
now therefore thus saith the lord of host ; consider you way .
ye have sow much , and bring in little ; ye eat , but ye have not enough ; ye drink , but ye be not fill with drink ; ye clothe you , but there be none warm ; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with hole .
thus saith the lord of host ; consider you way .
go up to the mountain , and bring wood , and build the house ; and i will take pleasure in it , and i will be glorified , saith the lord .
ye look for much , and lo , it come to little ; and when ye bring it home , i do blow upon it .
why ? saith the lord of host .
because of mine house that be waste , and ye run every man unto he own house .
therefore the heaven over you be stay from dew , and the earth be stay from she fruit .
and i call for a drought upon the land , and upon the mountain , and upon the corn , and upon the new wine , and upon the oil , and upon that which the ground bringeth forth , and upon man , and upon cattle , and upon all the labour of the hand .
then zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , and joshua the son of josedech , the high priest , with all the remnant of the people , obey the voice of the lord they god , and the word of haggai the prophet , as the lord they god have send he , and the people do fear before the lord .
then spake haggai the lord 's messenger in the lord 's message unto the people , say , i be with you , saith the lord .
and the lord stir up the spirit of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , governor of judah , and the spirit of joshua the son of josedech , the high priest , and the spirit of all the remnant of the people ; and they come and do work in the house of the lord of host , they god ,
in the four and twentieth day of the sixth month , in the second year of darius the king .
in the seventh month , in the one and twentieth day of the month , come the word of the lord by the prophet haggai , say ,
speak now to zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , governor of judah , and to joshua the son of josedech , the high priest , and to the residue of the people , say ,
who be leave among you that see this house in she first glory ? and how do ye see it now ? be it not in you eye in comparison of it as nothing ?
yet now be strong , o zerubbabel , saith the lord ; and be strong , o joshua , son of josedech , the high priest ; and be strong , all ye people of the land , saith the lord , and work : for i be with you , saith the lord of host :
accord to the word that i covenant with you when ye come out of egypt , so my spirit remaineth among you : fear ye not .
for thus saith the lord of host ; yet once , it be a little while , and i will shake the heaven , and the earth , and the sea , and the dry land ;
and i will shake all nation , and the desire of all nation shall come : and i will fill this house with glory , saith the lord of host .
the silver be mine , and the gold be mine , saith the lord of host .
the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former , saith the lord of host : and in this place will i give peace , saith the lord of host .
in the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , in the second year of darius , come the word of the lord by haggai the prophet , say ,
thus saith the lord of host ; ask now the priest concern the law , say ,
if one bear holy flesh in the skirt of he garment , and with he skirt do touch bread , or pottage , or wine , or oil , or any meat , shall it be holy ?
and the priest answer and say , no. .
then say haggai , if one that be unclean by a dead body touch any of these , shall it be unclean ?
and the priest answer and say , it shall be unclean .
then answer haggai , and say , so be this people , and so be this nation before i , saith the lord ; and so be every work of they hand ; and that which they offer there be unclean .
and now , i pray you , consider from this day and upward , from before a stone be lay upon a stone in the temple of the lord :
since those day be , when one come to a heap of twenty measure , there be but ten : when one come to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessel out of the press , there be but twenty .
i smite you with blast and with mildew and with hail in all the labour of you hand ; yet ye turn not to i , saith the lord .
consider now from this day and upward , from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , even from the day that the foundation of the lord 's temple be lay , consider it .
be the seed yet in the barn ? yea , as yet the vine , and the fig tree , and the pomegranate , and the olive tree , have not bring forth : from this day will i bless you .
and again the word of the lord come unto haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month , say ,
speak to zerubbabel , governor of judah , say , i will shake the heaven and the earth ;
and i will overthrow the throne of kingdom , and i will destroy the strength of the kingdom of the heathen ; and i will overthrow the chariot , and those that ride in they ; and the horse and they rider shall come down , every one by the sword of he brother .
in that day , saith the lord of host , will i take thee , o zerubbabel , my servant , the son of shealtiel , saith the lord , and will make thee as a signet : for i have choose thee , saith the lord of host .
in the eighth month , in the second year of darius , come the word of the lord unto zechariah , the son of berechiah , the son of iddo the prophet , say ,
the lord have be sore displeased with you father .
therefore say thou unto they , thus saith the lord of host ; turn ye unto i , saith the lord of host , and i will turn unto you , saith the lord of host .
be ye not as you father , unto whom the former prophet have cry , say , thus saith the lord of host ; turn ye now from you evil way , and from you evil doings : but they do not hear , nor hearken unto i , saith the lord .
you father , where be they ? and the prophet , do they live for ever ?
but my word and my statute , which i command my servant the prophet , do they not take hold of you father ? and they return and say , like as the lord of host think to do unto we , accord to we way , and accord to we doings , so have he deal with we .
upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month , which be the month sebat , in the second year of darius , come the word of the lord unto zechariah , the son of berechiah , the son of iddo the prophet , say ,
i see by night , and behold a man ride upon a red horse , and he stand among the myrtle tree that be in the bottom ; and behind he be there red horse , speckled , and white .
then say i , o my lord , what be these ?
and the angel that talk with i say unto i , i will shew thee what these be .
and the man that stand among the myrtle tree answer and say , these be they whom the lord have send to walk to and fro through the earth .
and they answer the angel of the lord that stand among the myrtle tree , and say , we have walk to and fro through the earth , and , behold , all the earth sitteth still , and be at rest .
then the angel of the lord answer and say , o lord of host , how long wilt thou not have mercy on jerusalem and on the city of judah , against which thou hast have indignation these threescore and ten year ?
and the lord answer the angel that talk with i with good word and comfortable word .
so the angel that commune with i say unto i , cry thou , say , thus saith the lord of host ; i be jealous for jerusalem and for zion with a great jealousy .
and i be very sore displeased with the heathen that be at ease : for i be but a little displeased , and they help forward the affliction .
therefore thus saith the lord ; i be return to jerusalem with mercy : my house shall be build in it , saith the lord of host , and a line shall be stretch forth upon jerusalem .
cry yet , say , thus saith the lord of host ; my city through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad ; and the lord shall yet comfort zion , and shall yet choose jerusalem .
then lift i up mine eye , and see , and behold four horn .
and i say unto the angel that talk with i , what be these ?
and he answer i , these be the horn which have scatter judah , israel , and jerusalem .
and the lord shew i four carpenter .
then say i , what come these to do ?
and he speak , say , these be the horn which have scatter judah , so that no man do lift up he head : but these be come to fray they , to cast out the horn of the gentiles , which lift up they horn over the land of judah to scatter it .
i lift up mine eye again , and look , and behold a man with a measure line in he hand .
then say i , whither goest thou ?
and he say unto i , to measure jerusalem , to see what be the breadth thereof , and what be the length thereof .
and , behold , the angel that talk with i go forth , and another angel go out to meet he ,
and say unto he , run , speak to this young man , say , jerusalem shall be inhabit as town without wall for the multitude of man and cattle therein :
for i , saith the lord , will be unto she a wall of fire round about , and will be the glory in the midst of she .
ho , ho , come forth , and flee from the land of the north , saith the lord : for i have spread you abroad as the four wind of the heaven , saith the lord .
deliver thyself , o zion , that dwellest with the daughter of babylon .
for thus saith the lord of host ; after the glory have he send i unto the nation which spoil you : for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of he eye .
for , behold , i will shake mine hand upon they , and they shall be a spoil to they servant : and ye shall know that the lord of host have send i .
sing and rejoice , o daughter of zion : for , lo , i come , and i will dwell in the midst of thee , saith the lord .
and many nation shall be join to the lord in that day , and shall be my people : and i will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that the lord of host have send i unto thee .
and the lord shall inherit judah he portion in the holy land , and shall choose jerusalem again .
be silent , o all flesh , before the lord : for he be raise up out of he holy habitation .
and he shew i joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord , and satan stand at he right hand to resist he .
and the lord say unto satan , the lord rebuke thee , o satan ; even the lord that have choose jerusalem rebuke thee : be not this a brand pluck out of the fire ?
now joshua be clothe with filthy garment , and stand before the angel .
and he answer and speak unto those that stand before he , say , take away the filthy garment from he .
and unto he he say , behold , i have cause thine iniquity to pass from thee , and i will clothe thee with change of raiment .
and i say , let they set a fair mitre upon he head .
so they set a fair mitre upon he head , and clothe he with garment .
and the angel of the lord stand by .
and the angel of the lord protest unto joshua , say ,
thus saith the lord of host ; if thou wilt walk in my way , and if thou wilt keep my charge , then thou shalt also judge my house , and shalt also keep my court , and i will give thee place to walk among these that stand by .
hear now , o joshua the high priest , thou , and thy fellow that sit before thee : for they be man wonder at : for , behold , i will bring forth my servant the branch .
for behold the stone that i have lay before joshua ; upon one stone shall be seven eye : behold , i will engrave the grave thereof , saith the lord of host , and i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day .
in that day , saith the lord of host , shall ye call every man he neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree .
and the angel that talk with i come again , and wake i , as a man that be waken out of he sleep ,
and say unto i , what seest thou ?
and i say , i have look , and behold a candlestick all of gold , with a bowl upon the top of it , and he seven lamp thereon , and seven pipe to the seven lamp , which be upon the top thereof :
and two olive tree by it , one upon the right side of the bowl , and the other upon the left side thereof .
so i answer and speak to the angel that talk with i , say , what be these , my lord ?
then the angel that talk with i answer and say unto i , knowest thou not what these be ?
and i say , no , my lord .
then he answer and speak unto i , say , this be the word of the lord unto zerubbabel , say , not by might , nor by power , but by my spirit , saith the lord of host .
who art thou , o great mountain ? before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain : and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting , cry , grace , grace unto it .
moreover the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
the hand of zerubbabel have lay the foundation of this house ; he hand shall also finish it ; and thou shalt know that the lord of host have send i unto you .
for who have despise the day of small thing ? for they shall rejoice , and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven ; they be the eye of the lord , which run to and fro through the whole earth .
then answer i , and say unto he , what be these two olive tree upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof ?
and i answer again , and say unto he , what be these two olive branch which through the two golden pipe empty the golden oil out of themselves ?
and he answer i and say , knowest thou not what these be ?
and i say , no , my lord .
then say he , these be the two anointed one , that stand by the lord of the whole earth .
then i turn , and lift up mine eye , and look , and behold a fly roll .
and he say unto i , what seest thou ?
and i answer , i see a fly roll ; the length thereof be twenty cubit , and the breadth thereof ten cubit .
then say he unto i , this be the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth : for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side accord to it ; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side accord to it .
i will bring it forth , saith the lord of host , and it shall enter into the house of the thief , and into the house of he that sweareth falsely by my name : and it shall remain in the midst of he house , and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stone thereof .
then the angel that talk with i go forth , and say unto i , lift up now thine eye , and see what be this that goeth forth .
and i say , what be it ?
and he say , this be a ephah that goeth forth .
he say moreover , this be they resemblance through all the earth .
and , behold , there be lift up a talent of lead : and this be a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah .
and he say , this be wickedness .
and he cast it into the midst of the ephah ; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof .
then lift i up mine eye , and look , and , behold , there come out two woman , and the wind be in they wing ; for they have wing like the wing of a stork : and they lift up the ephah between the earth and the heaven .
then say i to the angel that talk with i , whither do these bear the ephah ?
and he say unto i , to build it a house in the land of shinar : and it shall be establish , and set there upon she own base .
and i turn , and lift up mine eye , and look , and , behold , there come four chariot out from between two mountain ; and the mountain be mountain of brass .
in the first chariot be red horse ; and in the second chariot black horse ;
and in the third chariot white horse ; and in the fourth chariot grisle and bay horse .
then i answer and say unto the angel that talk with i , what be these , my lord ?
and the angel answer and say unto i , these be the four spirit of the heaven , which go forth from stand before the lord of all the earth .
the black horse which be therein go forth into the north country ; and the white go forth after they ; and the grisled go forth toward the south country .
and the bay go forth , and seek to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth : and he say , get you hence , walk to and fro through the earth .
so they walk to and fro through the earth .
then cry he upon i , and spake unto i , say , behold , these that go toward the north country have quiet my spirit in the north country .
and the word of the lord come unto i , say ,
take of they of the captivity , even of heldai , of tobijah , and of jedaiah , which be come from babylon , and come thou the same day , and go into the house of josiah the son of zephaniah ;
then take silver and gold , and make crown , and set they upon the head of joshua the son of josedech , the high priest ;
and speak unto he , say , thus speaketh the lord of host , say , behold the man whose name be the branch ; and he shall grow up out of he place , and he shall build the temple of the lord :
even he shall build the temple of the lord ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule upon he throne ; and he shall be a priest upon he throne : and the counsel of peace shall be between they both .
and the crown shall be to helem , and to tobijah , and to jedaiah , and to hen the son of zephaniah , for a memorial in the temple of the lord .
and they that be far off shall come and build in the temple of the lord , and ye shall know that the lord of host have send i unto you .
and this shall come to pass , if ye will diligently obey the voice of the lord you god .
and it come to pass in the fourth year of king darius , that the word of the lord come unto zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month , even in chisleu ;
when they have send unto the house of god sherezer and regemmelech , and they man , to pray before the lord ,
and to speak unto the priest which be in the house of the lord of host , and to the prophet , say , should i weep in the fifth month , separate myself , as i have do these so many year ?
then come the word of the lord of host unto i , say ,
speak unto all the people of the land , and to the priest , say , when ye fast and mourn in the fifth and seventh month , even those seventy year , do ye at all fast unto i , even to i ?
and when ye do eat , and when ye do drink , do not ye eat for yourselve , and drink for yourselve ?
should ye not hear the word which the lord have cry by the former prophet , when jerusalem be inhabit and in prosperity , and the city thereof round about she , when man inhabit the south and the plain ?
and the word of the lord come unto zechariah , say ,
thus speaketh the lord of host , say , execute true judgment , and shew mercy and compassion every man to he brother :
and oppress not the widow , nor the fatherless , the stranger , nor the poor ; and let none of you imagine evil against he brother in you heart .
but they refuse to hearken , and pull away the shoulder , and stop they ear , that they should not hear .
yea , they make they heart as a adamant stone , lest they should hear the law , and the word which the lord of host have send in he spirit by the former prophet : therefore come a great wrath from the lord of host .
therefore it be come to pass , that as he cry , and they would not hear ; so they cry , and i would not hear , saith the lord of host :
but i scatter they with a whirlwind among all the nation whom they know not .
thus the land be desolate after they , that no man pass through nor return : for they lay the pleasant land desolate .
again the word of the lord of host come to i , say ,
thus saith the lord of host ; i be jealous for zion with great jealousy , and i be jealous for she with great fury .
thus saith the lord ; i be return unto zion , and will dwell in the midst of jerusalem : and jerusalem shall be call a city of truth ; and the mountain of the lord of host the holy mountain .
thus saith the lord of host ; there shall yet old man and old woman dwell in the street of jerusalem , and every man with he staff in he hand for very age .
and the street of the city shall be full of boy and girl play in the street thereof .
thus saith the lord of host ; if it be marvellous in the eye of the remnant of this people in these day , should it also be marvellous in mine eye ? saith the lord of host .
thus saith the lord of host ; behold , i will save my people from the east country , and from the west country ;
and i will bring they , and they shall dwell in the midst of jerusalem : and they shall be my people , and i will be they god , in truth and in righteousness .
thus saith the lord of host ; let you hand be strong , ye that hear in these day these word by the mouth of the prophet , which be in the day that the foundation of the house of the lord of host be lay , that the temple might be build .
for before these day there be no hire for man , nor any hire for beast ; neither be there any peace to he that go out or come in because of the affliction : for i set all man every one against he neighbour .
but now i will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former day , saith the lord of host .
for the seed shall be prosperous ; the vine shall give she fruit , and the ground shall give she increase , and the heaven shall give they dew ; and i will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these thing .
and it shall come to pass , that as ye be a curse among the heathen , o house of judah , and house of israel ; so will i save you , and ye shall be a blessing : fear not , but let you hand be strong .
for thus saith the lord of host ; as i think to punish you , when you father provoke i to wrath , saith the lord of host , and i repent not :
so again have i think in these day to do well unto jerusalem and to the house of judah : fear ye not .
these be the thing that ye shall do ; speak ye every man the truth to he neighbour ; execute the judgment of truth and peace in you gate :
and let none of you imagine evil in you heart against he neighbour ; and love no false oath : for all these be thing that i hate , saith the lord .
and the word of the lord of host come unto i , say ,
thus saith the lord of host ; the fast of the fourth month , and the fast of the fifth , and the fast of the seventh , and the fast of the tenth , shall be to the house of judah joy and gladness , and cheerful feast ; therefore love the truth and peace .
thus saith the lord of host ; it shall yet come to pass , that there shall come people , and the inhabitant of many city :
and the inhabitant of one city shall go to another , say , let we go speedily to pray before the lord , and to seek the lord of host : i will go also .
yea , many people and strong nation shall come to seek the lord of host in jerusalem , and to pray before the lord .
thus saith the lord of host ; in those day it shall come to pass , that ten man shall take hold out of all language of the nation , even shall take hold of the skirt of he that be a jew , say , we will go with you : for we have hear that god be with you .
the burden of the word of the lord in the land of hadrach , and damascus shall be the rest thereof : when the eye of man , as of all the tribe of israel , shall be toward the lord .
and hamath also shall border thereby ; tyrus , and zidon , though it be very wise .
and tyrus do build herself a strong hold , and heap up silver as the dust , and fine gold as the mire of the street .
behold , the lord will cast she out , and he will smite she power in the sea ; and she shall be devour with fire .
ashkelon shall see it , and fear ; gaza also shall see it , and be very sorrowful , and ekron ; for she expectation shall be ashamed ; and the king shall perish from gaza , and ashkelon shall not be inhabit .
and a bastard shall dwell in ashdod , and i will cut off the pride of the philistines .
and i will take away he blood out of he mouth , and he abomination from between he tooth : but he that remaineth , even he , shall be for we god , and he shall be as a governor in judah , and ekron as a jebusite .
and i will encamp about mine house because of the army , because of he that passeth by , and because of he that returneth : and no oppressor shall pass through they any more : for now have i see with mine eye .
rejoice greatly , o daughter of zion ; shout , o daughter of jerusalem : behold , thy king cometh unto thee : he be just , and have salvation ; lowly , and ride upon a ass , and upon a colt the foal of a ass .
and i will cut off the chariot from ephraim , and the horse from jerusalem , and the battle bow shall be cut off : and he shall speak peace unto the heathen : and he dominion shall be from sea even to sea , and from the river even to the end of the earth .
as for thee also , by the blood of thy covenant i have send forth thy prisoner out of the pit wherein be no water .
turn you to the strong hold , ye prisoner of hope : even to day do i declare that i will render double unto thee ;
when i have bent judah for i , fill the bow with ephraim , and raise up thy son , o zion , against thy son , o greece , and make thee as the sword of a mighty man .
and the lord shall be see over they , and he arrow shall go forth as the lightning : and the lord god shall blow the trumpet , and shall go with whirlwind of the south .
the lord of host shall defend they ; and they shall devour , and subdue with sling stone ; and they shall drink , and make a noise as through wine ; and they shall be fill like bowl , and as the corner of the altar .
and the lord they god shall save they in that day as the flock of he people : for they shall be as the stone of a crown , lift up as a ensign upon he land .
for how great be he goodness , and how great be he beauty ! corn shall make the young man cheerful , and new wine the maid .
ask ye of the lord rain in the time of the latter rain ; so the lord shall make bright cloud , and give they shower of rain , to every one grass in the field .
for the idol have speak vanity , and the diviner have see a lie , and have tell false dream ; they comfort in vain : therefore they go they way as a flock , they be trouble , because there be no shepherd .
mine anger be kindle against the shepherd , and i punish the goat : for the lord of host have visit he flock the house of judah , and have make they as he goodly horse in the battle .
out of he come forth the corner , out of he the nail , out of he the battle bow , out of he every oppressor together .
and they shall be as mighty man , which tread down they enemy in the mire of the street in the battle : and they shall fight , because the lord be with they , and the rider on horse shall be confound .
and i will strengthen the house of judah , and i will save the house of joseph , and i will bring they again to place they ; for i have mercy upon they : and they shall be as though i have not cast they off : for i be the lord they god , and will hear they .
and they of ephraim shall be like a mighty man , and they heart shall rejoice as through wine : yea , they child shall see it , and be glad ; they heart shall rejoice in the lord .
i will hiss for they , and gather they ; for i have redeem they : and they shall increase as they have increase .
and i will sow they among the people : and they shall remember i in far country ; and they shall live with they child , and turn again .
i will bring they again also out of the land of egypt , and gather they out of assyria ; and i will bring they into the land of gilead and lebanon ; and place shall not be find for they .
and he shall pass through the sea with affliction , and shall smite the wave in the sea , and all the deep of the river shall dry up : and the pride of assyria shall be bring down , and the sceptre of egypt shall depart away .
and i will strengthen they in the lord ; and they shall walk up and down in he name , saith the lord .
open thy door , o lebanon , that the fire may devour thy cedar .
howl , fir tree ; for the cedar be fall ; because the mighty be spoil : howl , o ye oak of bashan ; for the forest of the vintage be come down .
there be a voice of the howling of the shepherd ; for they glory be spoil : a voice of the roaring of young lion ; for the pride of jordan be spoil .
thus saith the lord my god ; feed the flock of the slaughter ;
whose possessor slay they , and hold themselves not guilty : and they that sell they say , bless be the lord ; for i be rich : and they own shepherd pity they not .
for i will no more pity the inhabitant of the land , saith the lord : but , lo , i will deliver the man every one into he neighbour 's hand , and into the hand of he king : and they shall smite the land , and out of they hand i will not deliver they .
and i will feed the flock of slaughter , even you , o poor of the flock .
and i take unto i two stave ; the one i call beauty , and the other i call band ; and i feed the flock .
three shepherd also i cut off in one month ; and my soul lothe they , and they soul also abhor i .
then say i , i will not feed you : that that dieth , let it die ; and that that be to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another .
and i take my staff , even beauty , and cut it asunder , that i might break my covenant which i have make with all the people .
and it be break in that day : and so the poor of the flock that wait upon i know that it be the word of the lord .
and i say unto they , if ye think good , give i my price ; and if not , forbear .
so they weigh for my price thirty piece of silver .
and the lord say unto i , cast it unto the potter : a goodly price that i be prise at of they .
and i take the thirty piece of silver , and cast they to the potter in the house of the lord .
then i cut asunder mine other staff , even bands , that i might break the brotherhood between judah and israel .
and the lord say unto i , take unto thee yet the instrument of a foolish shepherd .
for , lo , i will raise up a shepherd in the land , which shall not visit those that be cut off , neither shall seek the young one , nor heal that that be break , nor feed that that standeth still : but he shall eat the flesh of the fat , and tear they claw in piece .
woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock ! the sword shall be upon he arm , and upon he right eye : he arm shall be clean dry up , and he right eye shall be utterly darkened .
the burden of the word of the lord for israel , saith the lord , which stretcheth forth the heaven , and layeth the foundation of the earth , and formeth the spirit of man within he .
behold , i will make jerusalem a cup of tremble unto all the people round about , when they shall be in the siege both against judah and against jerusalem .
and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people : all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in piece , though all the people of the earth be gather together against it .
in that day , saith the lord , i will smite every horse with astonishment , and he rider with madness : and i will open mine eye upon the house of judah , and will smite every horse of the people with blindness .
and the governor of judah shall say in they heart , the inhabitant of jerusalem shall be my strength in the lord of host they god .
in that day will i make the governor of judah like a hearth of fire among the wood , and like a torch of fire in a sheaf ; and they shall devour all the people round about , on the right hand and on the left : and jerusalem shall be inhabit again in she own place , even in jerusalem .
the lord also shall save the tent of judah first , that the glory of the house of david and the glory of the inhabitant of jerusalem do not magnify themselves against judah .
in that day shall the lord defend the inhabitant of jerusalem ; and he that be feeble among they at that day shall be as david ; and the house of david shall be as god , as the angel of the lord before they .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that i will seek to destroy all the nation that come against jerusalem .
and i will pour upon the house of david , and upon the inhabitant of jerusalem , the spirit of grace and of supplication : and they shall look upon i whom they have pierce , and they shall mourn for he , as one mourneth for he only son , and shall be in bitterness for he , as one that be in bitterness for he firstborn .
in that day shall there be a great mourning in jerusalem , as the mourning of hadadrimmon in the valley of megiddon .
and the land shall mourn , every family apart ; the family of the house of david apart , and they wife apart ; the family of the house of nathan apart , and they wife apart ;
the family of the house of levi apart , and they wife apart ; the family of shimei apart , and they wife apart ;
all the family that remain , every family apart , and they wife apart .
in that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of david and to the inhabitant of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the lord of host , that i will cut off the name of the idol out of the land , and they shall no more be remember : and also i will cause the prophet and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land .
and it shall come to pass , that when any shall yet prophesy , then he father and he mother that beget he shall say unto he , thou shalt not live ; for thou speakest lie in the name of the lord : and he father and he mother that beget he shall thrust he through when he prophesieth .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the prophet shall be ashamed every one of he vision , when he have prophesy ; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive :
but he shall say , i be no prophet , i be a husbandman ; for man teach i to keep cattle from my youth .
and one shall say unto he , what be these wound in thine hand ?
then he shall answer , those with which i be wound in the house of my friend .
awake , o sword , against my shepherd , and against the man that be my fellow , saith the lord of host : smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scatter : and i will turn mine hand upon the little one .
and it shall come to pass , that in all the land , saith the lord , two part therein shall be cut off and die ; but the third shall be leave therein .
and i will bring the third part through the fire , and will refine they as silver be refine , and will try they as gold be try : they shall call on my name , and i will hear they : i will say , it be my people : and they shall say , the lord be my god .
behold , the day of the lord cometh , and thy spoil shall be divide in the midst of thee .
for i will gather all nation against jerusalem to battle ; and the city shall be take , and the house rifle , and the woman ravish ; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity , and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
then shall the lord go forth , and fight against those nation , as when he fight in the day of battle .
and he foot shall stand in that day upon the mount of olive , which be before jerusalem on the east , and the mount of olive shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west , and there shall be a very great valley ; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north , and half of it toward the south .
and ye shall flee to the valley of the mountain ; for the valley of the mountain shall reach unto azal : yea , ye shall flee , like as ye flee from before the earthquake in the day of uzziah king of judah : and the lord my god shall come , and all the saint with thee .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the light shall not be clear , nor dark :
but it shall be one day which shall be know to the lord , not day , nor night : but it shall come to pass , that at evening time it shall be light .
and it shall be in that day , that live water shall go out from jerusalem ; half of they toward the former sea , and half of they toward the hinder sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and the lord shall be king over all the earth : in that day shall there be one lord , and he name one .
all the land shall be turn as a plain from geba to rimmon south of jerusalem : and it shall be lift up , and inhabit in she place , from benjamin 's gate unto the place of the first gate , unto the corner gate , and from the tower of hananeel unto the king 's winepress .
and man shall dwell in it , and there shall be no more utter destruction ; but jerusalem shall be safely inhabit .
and this shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite all the people that have fight against jerusalem ; they flesh shall consume away while they stand upon they foot , and they eye shall consume away in they hole , and they tongue shall consume away in they mouth .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a great tumult from the lord shall be among they ; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of he neighbour , and he hand shall rise up against the hand of he neighbour .
and judah also shall fight at jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gather together , gold , and silver , and apparel , in great abundance .
and so shall be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the camel , and of the ass , and of all the beast that shall be in these tent , as this plague .
and it shall come to pass , that every one that be leave of all the nation which come against jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king , the lord of host , and to keep the feast of tabernacle .
and it shall be , that whoso will not come up of all the family of the earth unto jerusalem to worship the king , the lord of host , even upon they shall be no rain .
and if the family of egypt go not up , and come not , that have no rain ; there shall be the plague , wherewith the lord will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacle .
this shall be the punishment of egypt , and the punishment of all nation that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacle .
in that day shall there be upon the bell of the horse , holiness unto the lord ; and the pot in the lord 's house shall be like the bowl before the altar .
yea , every pot in jerusalem and in judah shall be holiness unto the lord of host : and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of they , and seethe therein : and in that day there shall be no more the canaanite in the house of the lord of host .
the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi .
i have love you , saith the lord .
yet ye say , wherein hast thou love we ?
be not esau jacob 's brother ? saith the lord : yet i love jacob ,
and i hate esau , and lay he mountain and he heritage waste for the dragon of the wilderness .
whereas edom saith , we be impoverished , but we will return and build the desolate place ; thus saith the lord of host , they shall build , but i will throw down ; and they shall call they , the border of wickedness , and , the people against whom the lord have indignation for ever .
and you eye shall see , and ye shall say , the lord will be magnify from the border of israel .
a son honoureth he father , and a servant he master : if then i be a father , where be mine honour ? and if i be a master , where be my fear ? saith the lord of host unto you , o priest , that despise my name .
and ye say , wherein have we despise thy name ?
ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar ; and ye say , wherein have we polluted thee ?
in that ye say , the table of the lord be contemptible .
and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice , be it not evil ? and if ye offer the lame and sick , be it not evil ? offer it now unto thy governor ; will he be please with thee , or accept thy person ? saith the lord of host .
and now , i pray you , beseech god that he will be gracious unto we : this have be by you means : will he regard you person ? saith the lord of host .
who be there even among you that would shut the door for nought ? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought .
i have no pleasure in you , saith the lord of host , neither will i accept a offering at you hand .
for from the rising of the sun even unto the go down of the same my name shall be great among the gentiles ; and in every place incense shall be offer unto my name , and a pure offering : for my name shall be great among the heathen , saith the lord of host .
but ye have profane it , in that ye say , the table of the lord be polluted ; and the fruit thereof , even he meat , be contemptible .
ye say also , behold , what a weariness be it ! and ye have snuff at it , saith the lord of host ; and ye bring that which be tear , and the lame , and the sick ; thus ye bring a offering : should i accept this of you hand ? saith the lord .
but curse be the deceiver , which have in he flock a male , and voweth , and sacrificeth unto the lord a corrupt thing : for i be a great king , saith the lord of host , and my name be dreadful among the heathen .
and now , o ye priest , this commandment be for you .
if ye will not hear , and if ye will not lay it to heart , to give glory unto my name , saith the lord of host , i will even send a curse upon you , and i will curse you blessing : yea , i have curse they already , because ye do not lay it to heart .
behold , i will corrupt you seed , and spread dung upon you face , even the dung of you solemn feast ; and one shall take you away with it .
and ye shall know that i have send this commandment unto you , that my covenant might be with levi , saith the lord of host .
my covenant be with he of life and peace ; and i give they to he for the fear wherewith he fear i , and be afraid before my name .
the law of truth be in he mouth , and iniquity be not find in he lip : he walk with i in peace and equity , and do turn many away from iniquity .
for the priest 's lip should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at he mouth : for he be the messenger of the lord of host .
but ye be depart out of the way ; ye have cause many to stumble at the law ; ye have corrupt the covenant of levi , saith the lord of host .
therefore have i also make you contemptible and base before all the people , accord as ye have not keep my way , but have be partial in the law .
have we not all one father ? have not one god create we ? why do we deal treacherously every man against he brother , by profane the covenant of we father ?
judah have deal treacherously , and a abomination be commit in israel and in jerusalem ; for judah have profane the holiness of the lord which he love , and have marry the daughter of a strange god .
the lord will cut off the man that doeth this , the master and the scholar , out of the tabernacle of jacob , and he that offereth a offering unto the lord of host .
and this have ye do again , cover the altar of the lord with tear , with weep , and with cry out , insomuch that he regardeth not the offer any more , or receiveth it with good will at you hand .
yet ye say , wherefore ?
because the lord have be witness between thee and the wife of thy youth , against whom thou hast deal treacherously : yet be she thy companion , and the wife of thy covenant .
and do not he make one ?
yet have he the residue of the spirit .
and wherefore one ?
that he might seek a godly seed .
therefore take heed to you spirit , and let none deal treacherously against the wife of he youth .
for the lord , the god of israel , saith that he hateth put away : for one covereth violence with he garment , saith the lord of host : therefore take heed to you spirit , that ye deal not treacherously .
ye have weary the lord with you word .
yet ye say , wherein have we weary he ?
when ye say , every one that doeth evil be good in the sight of the lord , and he delighteth in they ; or , where be the god of judgment ?
behold , i will send my messenger , and he shall prepare the way before i : and the lord , whom ye seek , shall suddenly come to he temple , even the messenger of the covenant , whom ye delight in : behold , he shall come , saith the lord of host .
but who may abide the day of he come ? and who shall stand when he appeareth ? for he be like a refiner 's fire , and like fuller ' soap :
and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver : and he shall purify the son of levi , and purge they as gold and silver , that they may offer unto the lord a offering in righteousness .
then shall the offering of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto the lord , as in the day of old , and as in former year .
and i will come near to you to judgment ; and i will be a swift witness against the sorcerer , and against the adulterer , and against false swearer , and against those that oppress the hireling in he wages , the widow , and the fatherless , and that turn aside the stranger from he right , and fear not i , saith the lord of host .
for i be the lord , i change not ; therefore ye son of jacob be not consume .
even from the day of you father ye be go away from mine ordinance , and have not keep they .
return unto i , and i will return unto you , saith the lord of host .
but ye say , wherein shall we return ?
will a man rob god ?
yet ye have rob i .
but ye say , wherein have we rob thee ?
in tithe and offering .
ye be curse with a curse : for ye have rob i , even this whole nation .
bring ye all the tithe into the storehouse , that there may be meat in mine house , and prove i now herewith , saith the lord of host , if i will not open you the window of heaven , and pour you out a blessing , that there shall not be room enough to receive it .
and i will rebuke the devourer for you sake , and he shall not destroy the fruit of you ground ; neither shall you vine cast she fruit before the time in the field , saith the lord of host .
and all nation shall call you bless : for ye shall be a delightsome land , saith the lord of host .
you word have be stout against i , saith the lord .
yet ye say , what have we speak so much against thee ?
ye have say , it be vain to serve god : and what profit be it that we have keep he ordinance , and that we have walk mournfully before the lord of host ?
and now we call the proud happy ; yea , they that work wickedness be set up ; yea , they that tempt god be even deliver .
then they that fear the lord spake often one to another : and the lord hearken , and hear it , and a book of remembrance be write before he for they that fear the lord , and that think upon he name .
and they shall be mine , saith the lord of host , in that day when i make up my jewel ; and i will spare they , as a man spareth he own son that serveth he .
then shall ye return , and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between he that serveth god and he that serveth he not .
for , behold , the day cometh , that shall burn as a oven ; and all the proud , yea , and all that do wickedly , shall be stubble : and the day that cometh shall burn they up , saith the lord of host , that it shall leave they neither root nor branch .
but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in he wing ; and ye shall go forth , and grow up as calf of the stall .
and ye shall tread down the wicked ; for they shall be ash under the sole of you foot in the day that i shall do this , saith the lord of host .
remember ye the law of moses my servant , which i command unto he in horeb for all israel , with the statute and judgment .
behold , i will send you elijah the prophet before the come of the great and dreadful day of the lord :
and he shall turn the heart of the father to the child , and the heart of the child to they father , lest i come and smite the earth with a curse .
the book of the generation of jesus christ , the son of david , the son of abraham .
abraham beget isaac ; and isaac beget jacob ; and jacob beget judas and he brethren ;
and judas beget phares and zara of thamar ; and phares beget esrom ; and esrom beget aram ;
and aram beget aminadab ; and aminadab beget naasson ; and naasson beget salmon ;
and salmon beget booz of rachab ; and booz beget obed of ruth ; and obe begat jesse ;
and jesse beget david the king ; and david the king beget solomon of she that have be the wife of urias ;
and solomon beget roboam ; and roboam beget abia ; and abia beget asa ;
and asa beget josaphat ; and josaphat beget joram ; and joram beget ozias ;
and ozias beget joatham ; and joatham beget achaz ; and achaz beget ezekias ;
and ezekias beget manass ; and manasses beget amon ; and amon begat josias ;
and josias beget jechonias and he brethren , about the time they be carry away to babylon :
and after they be bring to babylon , jechonias beget salathiel ; and salathiel beget zorobabel ;
and zorobabel beget abiud ; and abiud beget eliakim ; and eliakim beget azor ;
and azor beget sadoc ; and sadoc beget achim ; and achim beget eliud ;
and eliud beget eleazar ; and eleazar beget matthan ; and matthan beget jacob ;
and jacob beget joseph the husband of mary , of whom be bear jesus , who be call christ .
so all the generation from abraham to david be fourteen generation ; and from david until the carry away into babylon be fourteen generation ; and from the carry away into babylon unto christ be fourteen generation .
now the birth of jesus christ be on this wise : when as he mother mary be espouse to joseph , before they come together , she be find with child of the holy ghost .
then joseph she husband , be a just man , and not willing to make she a publick example , be mind to put she away privily .
but while he think on these thing , behold , the angel of the lord appear unto he in a dream , say , joseph , thou son of david , fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife : for that which be conceive in she is of the holy ghost .
and she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call he name jesus : for he shall save he people from they sin .
now all this be do , that it might be fulfil which be speak of the lord by the prophet , say ,
behold , a virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call he name emmanuel , which be interpret be , god with we .
then joseph be raise from sleep do as the angel of the lord have bid he , and take unto he he wife :
and know she not till she have bring forth she firstborn son : and he call he name jesus .
now when jesus be bear in bethlehem of judaea in the day of herod the king , behold , there come wise man from the east to jerusalem ,
say , where be he that be bear king of the jews ? for we have see he star in the east , and be come to worship he .
